All:
   The field phase of the ACLAIM project wrapped up Thursday after having
5 flights and using 14 hours.  The PI, Rod Bogue of NASA/Dryden, said that
he considered the project very successful, and all objectives were met.  The 
turbulence encounters we had were not as strong as he would have liked for
demonstration purposes, however, Rod said that actually the low aerosol
and low turbulence measurements on several flights were very important for 
determining the sensitivity and lower threshold of the lidar instrument.
The RAF systems performed flawlessly throughout the project.
   Rod asked me to convey to all of the RAF staff that participated that he
found our services to be excellent and was very appreciative of the cooperation
and responsiveness of the RAF staff.  He commented that the flight crews, 
technicians and PMs were very easy to work with, especially their (our)
good natured tolerance of all of the observers and media that seemed to be
perpetually under foot.
   As project manager, I also wish to thank everybody and acknowledge all of 
the hard work and the acceptance without complaint of the many intrutions
by all of the observers and media associated with this project.  At times it
seemed that the hassles exceeded the size of the project. 
   Look for it on TV, but we don't know when.  ABC and Good Morning America
may run something tonight and/or Monday.

Dick,

Thanks.  I'll pick them up tomorrow.  Now that the MSS limit is 6GB
(1.5GB via MIGS), I'm not too concerned about file size any more, but
it is nice to know, in general.

Julie,

Thanks for your concern regarding the tapes I sent.  I'm not sure why they
took so long to get to you.

I have now finished staging them to the MSS, so please return them
(R1175-R1179) to me.

Thanks!

All:
  Here is an email from David Bowdle, one of the PIs on the ACLAIM project. He
is looking at ascii data from one of the flights. I gave him the cell by cell
concentrations from the FSSP 300 and the PCASP and the total concentrations.
As you can read, he is wondering why he can't total up the individual cells and
come up with the same number as the total concentrations.
  Given the differences he is talking about, I am not inclined to go through
all of the data and check this out, especially since we don't have any 
software to do this easily. So, before I tell him to "get a life", or that it
is just due to round off error, does anybody else have any thoughts as to why
these small differences are occurring? Ron and I looked over the code briefly
and it appears that the individual cells are calculated and then summed to get
the total. Should add up.

David:
  I checked into the differences you pointed out in your email regarding the
concentration for the PCASP and the preliminary ascii data. I went to flight
3 and randomly picked several seconds of data that had concentrations in most
cells from the netCDF file. Here the precision is greater than the converted
ascii files (five decimal places). I found that the sum of the individual cell
concentrations is identical to the variable CONCP_WDR which is the total 
concentration for the probe. As far as I can tell from a brief look at the 
algorithm, we calculate the individual cell concentration first and from that
we sum to get the total concentration, so all checks seem to be consistent.
  Since the original processing is done in IEEE floating point, the conversion 
to ascii with three decimal places can cause round-off errors to .5%. This 
precision is much better than the accuracy of the probes themselves. If you
work with the netCDF files you will get better precision, but not greater
accuracy.
  If you like, when I run the final ascii conversion I will increase the 
number of decimal places on the probe concentrations.
  Thanks for your help in calling potential problems to our attention. We rely
on our PIs to help us spot problems with our algorithms and processing. You 
must keep in mind that you are dealing with preliminary data and, in the case
of ascii files, data that do not have the precision of the original netCDF
files.

Dick,

Is RAF going to produce a production data set for 1998-802 ACLAIM?
I have archived the 5 raw ADS data but have not seen anything further.

Just curious.

   All of the ACLAIM flights are processed and are on the productiondata
disk. There is a flight setup file for each.
   I need to make ascii subsets for them. Can we archive these?

Dick,

I think your desire is to archive the ASCII data as well as the netCDF.
I can do this if you create the files.  I suggest adding the standard
.asc extention to them.  You are also welcome to put then into the
productiondata directory.

In the meantime, I'll prepare to archive the rest of the stuff (production
netCDF files, support files in the project 802 directory and the current
version of NIMBUS).

Dick,

I found no Flight_5 file in the project's Production subdirectory.  If you
didn't stash that file somewhere else, then the only documentation on the
changes you made for RF05 are within the netCDF header (buried with all the
other stuff you didn't change).  I noticed in the FlightGroups file that you
didn't cross-reference it with any other flight.

The only ramification of this omission is when anyone wants to process the
flight again, s/he will have to reinsert all the changes (assuming that they
are readily available); they won't automatically be recalled.

If this situation is unacceptable to you, I suggest reprocessing RF05, saving
the setup after making the changes but before clicking the "GO" button.

David:
   All of the final ACLAIM Electra data has been processed and archived. I have
replaced the ASCII file on the ftp directory. I emailed Rod Bogue several (2?)
weeks ago when this occurred and have not heard anything back making me 
wonder if he received the message. Would you distribute the message to
the ACLAIM participants that the data have been archived in netCDF format 
and the ASCII files have also been archived at NCAR on the Mass Storage System.
The ASCII files on the ftp directory at the RAF are not protected and could be
purged. In the future if one of the investigators wants to request a 1 Hz 
netCDF data file, a 1 HZ ASCII data file that has been purged, or any other 
special request such as high rate data, they should contact the RAF Data
Manager, Ron Ruth. His email address is ruth@ucar.edu, phone is 303-497-1084.
   Also, you should inform them that a new security filter is in place at NCAR
and to reach the ACLAIM ftp directory where the ASCII data are stored users
will have to log in to raf.atd.ucar.edu. The data are located in the same place 
as before, /home/ftp/pub/tmp/ACLAIM.
   Let me know if you have any questions about this.

regards,
Dick Friesen
