#  Note:  Create a copy of, modify and run this script from a project's 
#           "Production" directory.
#
#  Assumptions:
#   1.  Directory structure for projects is $LOCAL/proj/<3-digit project #>
#           having a "Production" subdirectory
#   2.  Project's name (only its name!) is in the file $LOCAL/proj/ProjectName
#   3.  A "proj.info" file exists in the project's "Production" subdirectory
#
#  Get setup information for this project
set PROJ = `pwd | sed -e "s/[a-zA-Z\/]//g"`
set PROJDIR = $LOCAL/proj/$PROJ
set FY = `grep FY proj.info | sed -e "s/FY=//"`
cd $PROJDIR
set PROJNAME = `cat ProjectName`
set OFILE = "$PROJDIR/Production/$PROJ.tar"

#  At this point one needs a list of files immediately under the above "tar
#   command.  As a starting point, one can use the `vi' command:   !!ls ..
#   to get a list of files in the project's directory and edit out the
#   unneeded ones.  
#  For the Production subdirectory, one can use this command:
#                       !!ls 
#  For a subdirectory under Production (e.g., archive), one can repeat this:
#                       !!ls archive
#  For a subdirectory off the main project directory, use a command such as:
#                       !!ls ../<directory>
#   (Execute these commands starting with the cursor at the first "#" line
#    below the `tar' command.  The `vi' command `!!ls' replaces the current
#    line with its output.)
#  Other subdirectories may also have files that need to be archived.
#  After you get the list of files, don't forget to add the subdirectory
#  name (if any) to the beginning of each file name and add a trailing
#  <space> and backslash (\) to each file name (except the last one), so
#  the `tar' command gets the entire list of files.
#
#  Brief summary for standard project files
# !!ls ..
#      (project's directory)
# !!ls
#      (Production subdirectory)
# !!ls archive
#      (Production/archive subdirectory)
#   filter out undesired files
#   prepend appropriate subdirectory to affected file names
#   Add backslash at end of each line (except last)
#   Save and exit
#

#  Get tar directory list for archiving
