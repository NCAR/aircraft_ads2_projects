The data sets were processed on 18 and 19 November 1993 on `chinook,' RAF's Sun
server reading Exabyte tape copies of the original RAF ADS data and using a
late `beta' version of the RAF NIMBUS software processor (before Revision 1).

Prior to Production (final processing), NIMBUS bugs were fixed primarily
affecting angular data, such as True Heading.  Only one extant NIMBUS bug,
present at the time of Production, is known to have affected the final,
processed data.  The variable "base_time," which is supposed to represent the
UNIX date/time at the start of the data set, has incorrect values that are
one month ahead and 2 seconds behind the true values.  "base_time" is used in
conjunction with "time_offset" to obtain the date/time of any record.  The
variables "HOUR," "MINUTE" and "SECOND" and the global values "FlightDate" and
"TimeInterval" can be used to replace the incorrect values.
 
Data sets FF01 and RF01 were extensively reviewed after Production using the
WINDS software.  These data looked to be in good order.  I understand from
Vince Glover that he used DAP to preview all the project's flight data looking
for discrepancies.  Revisions to tables, calibrations, etc. were made based
upon that review.  By the time I made the final production runs, all known
anomalies had been accounted for.
 
Data for this project have been archived on 24 November 1993 to the NCAR Mass
Store System (MSS) in the directory /RAF/1993/886/LRT.  A second set of netCDF
data files were produced using `tar' and also archived to the MSS.  The file
`nimbus.tar' contains (according to Chris Webster) all the necessary software
files to document how these data were processed.  Other files in this directory
(in addition to the archived data) are support files which are intended to
completely document the data processing for this project.

In December 1993 Chris Webster wrote a program to apply a patch to the
original processed data sets and create new netCDF data sets having corrected
`base_time' values.  These new data sets were archived on the MSS in the
/RAF/1993/886/LRT directory on 6 January 1993.  The old, uncorrected data sets
(written on 18 and 19 November 1993) were moved to the /RAF/1993/886/OLDLRT
directory and may be purged at some time in the future.
