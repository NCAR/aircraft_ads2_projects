Status: OR

All,

I just spoke with Lowell Genzlinger, and he let me know that the C-130
crew in California is presently planning on doing the final research
flight for Steve Dinardo tomorrow (Friday, 25 August) evening.  Lowell
told me that they plan to start packing up the aircraft for the ferry
home on Saturday.  However, whether or not the C-130 departs for Jeffco
on Saturday will depend on how late they are up flying Friday evening.
(Right now, they plan to takeoff around 10:00 or 11:00 p.m. local time.)

So, we can expect the C-130 to arrive back here at Jeffco on either
Saturday, 26 August or Sunday, 27 August.  No RAF staff will be needed
at Jeffco during the weekend to meet the aircraft.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Krista

All,

I just received the following message from John Cowan in California.  Looks
like Dinardo's project has been completed, and the C-130 will be back here at
Jeffco tomorrow (Sat., 8/26).

Via today's noon mail pickup at Jeffco I will be sending you (in a standard
dark blue bag) the following eleven (11) 8mm (Exabyte) tapes for archiving
to the SCD Mass Store System:
 
     R1505 through R1515
 
Please be aware that these tapes are for "read only."  Unlike ordinary
audio, video and DAT tapes, a black "hole" actually makes these tapes
writeable.  Therefore, the red, write-enable flag will be in the exposed
(ERASE OFF) position.  Do NOT change the position of this flag.  If a
tape seems to be write enabled, contact me immediately.
 
Please let me know when they are ready to read.
Thanks.  :)

There was no noon mail pickup today at Jeffco.  I expect a 2:30 pickup,
so the eleven tapes should be arriving a bit later this afternoon.

No problem.  I'm in no hurry to get these back, so the afternoon shuttle
run is fine.

Dick,

If you want a "complete" web site for Dinardo's Sea Salinity project,
I need the following information:
 - Start and end dates
 - Photos and captions (which you've already mentioned to me)
 - QA report (which you've already mentioned to me)
 - RAF and User-Supplied Instrumentation Lists
 - Video log (if video tapes were recorded during the project)
 - Though not necessary, Allen usually provides a measurement variable
     list that is "categorized."  You can find a recent example at:
          http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/AESOP/variables.html
     (Allen just gives me the list, and I reformat it for the web.)

I generated the rest of the web pages today (except for the Research Flight
Reports which I did earlier this month).  In case you want to peruse them,
the URL is:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/SEASAL/
You may want to rewrite the "cover letter" (the text on the project's home
page), since it is a virtual copy of Allen's AESOP letter.  You may want
to use some of his "boiler plate" stuff at the beginning of his QA report
which explains the general limitations of our instrumentation as they pertain
to this project.

Right now the "Sea Salinity" pages are viewable only within ATD.  They will
remain so until you tell me to release them.

The gzipped production netCDF files have been put in RAF's ftp space:
     ~ftp/pub/projects/SEA_SALINITY/

RAF has made this data directory available to all project participants.  It
contains the final low-rate production output netCDF files with flight-level
data for the NSF/NCAR EC-130Q Hercules aircraft during the Sea Salinity
Experiment (RAF Project No. 2000-107).

As of 30 October 2000, the data files are available at this site only in
compressed form using the GZIP format.  Once transferred to your site,
they can be uncompressed using the utility "gunzip," the Windows utility
"WinZip" or Aladdin Systems' "Expander."

gzip/gunzip (freeware) is available at the URL:
     http://www.gzip.org/

WinZip (shareware) can be downloaded from the URL:
     http://www.winzip.com/

Expander (freeware version) is available at the URL:
http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/

These data also are available uncompressed via the SCD Mass Store System
for those who have an NCAR/SCD GAU allocation.

RAF is preparing all the project documentation to be put on line at our web
site:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/SEASAL/

Please direct any questions regarding these data files to me.

Daniel,

I have finally corrected the LH (open path) data for those flights from CA
with both LH and WVSS.  The corrected LH files are available from the usual
ftp site.  The files contain hr, min, sec, UTseconds of the day, and
corrected LH value seperated with tabs delimiters.  There is also an ascii
file in there which translates between the flight number designation which
we use for each flight and the calendar date.  Let me know if you have any
questions or problems with the files or data.


You can use ftp in the passive mode to connect to 128.117.84.210.  Login as
anonymous and use your email address as the password.   cd to
/pub/tmp/gandrud/wvss and you will find files or can leave files.  The files
will remain for 30 days before they are scrubbed.

Bruce,

Is there a way you can easily produce these files in netCDF?  I'd like to
merge the data into our production NIMBUS data files.

There is not a good way to make netCDF files from from a PC that I know
about.  Isn't there an n2asc tool which does this on the UNIX side?

Bruce,

No I don't.  What data will she be providing?  I can ask her about it.

"n2asc" converts from netCDF to ASCII, not the other way around.  Chris
may have something I can use.  I know that there is a Unidatda program
that will work, too, but I don't know if the resulting file would conform
to the RAF conventions.  I will probably archive your files separately,
too.  I already copied them from the ftp site.

Dick,

I was wondering about the status of the following documents which I hope
to add to the Sea Salinity Project Summary web site:
  - QA Report (general, flight-to-flight)
  - Video Tape Log
  - Categorized variable list (optional, since I have list from netCDF file)
  - Calibration summary
  - Photos (if any)

I'd also like you to review the "front page" to see if it says what you want.
I do need official begin and end dates for the project, too.
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/SEASAL/

Since I am awaiting these items, the web site has not yet been released.
(Only ATD can view.)

Dick,

Just before Thanksgiving Bruce Gandrud pointed me to files with processed
Laser Hygrometer data for RF01-RF07 and FF02.  They were in ASCII and
formatted such that I had to rework them before using Chris' asc2cdf
program.  I have now transformed all the files to netCDF and was wondering
whether you wanted me to merge these data into our production netCDF files
for this project.

(He has yet to finish processing the TOPSE data.)

  Thanks for the info. No, I do not think that it is worth the effort. I know
that neither Dinardo or Teresa need/want the data. However, you should archive
the ascii files in case someone besides Bruce G. wants to ascertain the 
performance of the LH. Mane the files something that is obvious if you can.

thanks.

Dick,

I have already archived the netCDF files and can also archive Bruce's original
ASCII files.  The path for the netCDF files is:
     /RAF/2000/107/LRT/LH/RFxx.cdf
I would put the ASCII files in the same directory with the extension
changed to .asc.
