Revision 2
#
# This file contains flight equivalences.  That is "x := y"
# says that flight x should use the [nimbus] setup that was
# saved from flight y.  (Note the use of ff, rf and tf.)
# Do not use the same number for both entries.
#
# Examples:
#rf02 := rf01
#ff02 := rf01
#tf02 := rf01
#
rf01 := rf02
rf03 := rf02
rf04 := rf02
