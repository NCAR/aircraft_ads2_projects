Serial Data Feed to Users:

	RAF provides a serial data output common to all users who require
	separate recording of aircraft data.  Data packets are broadcast
	in ascii characters at 1 sec intervals.  Time coincidence with
	aircraft data recording will be less than 2 sec.

	Data packet format:

	HH:MM:SS +X.XXXXXXe+XX +X.XXXXXXe+XX ... etc

	Specific parameters available in the broadcast include any 
	variables in the RAF inventory - including position or research
	values. The order of variables selected for INDOEX appear below. 


	Connection to your system can be made thru either a DB25/female or
	DE9/male connector.  We use a 3 wire interface - transmit/receive/gnd
	with no handshake.  The feed is in plain ascii, 9600 baud (N81) with
	fields separated by a single space.
