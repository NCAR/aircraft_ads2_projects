Bruce,

Any idea when I can archive the raw ADS data from BASE to the SCD Mass Store
System?

Ron,
	I'm going to create a ~nimbus/120 directory for the base processor.
I'll put all relevant code there.

Bruce,

It would help me greatly if you could give the NIMBUS output files the
following naming convention:
   120RFxx.cdf  <-- low-rate production data, where `xx' is the flight number
   120RFxxH.cdf  <-- high-rate production data, where `xx' is the flight number

I'm sure you are already aware that you need to be logged in as `nimbus,'
and that the output files go in the `/home/local/data/production' directory. 

Thanks for the update.

Bruce,

FYI

   I renamed the production output files for 4-120 BASE in the
`/home/productiondata' directory to follow my standard naming convention.
They are very similar to your names, except that I added `RF' between the
project number and flight number, and I capitalized the segment letter.
For example:  12018a.cdf  -->  120RF18A.cdf

   The following flights have no date in the netCDF header:  RF07, RF12
and RF17.  Its entry looks like this:
  RF07   :FlightDate = " " ;
  RF12   :FlightDate = " " ;
  RF17   :FlightDate = " " ;
Most of the other flights have an incorrect date:
  RF04   :FlightDate = "01/00/1994 " ;
  RF10   :FlightDate = "03/26/1994 " ;
  RF11   :FlightDate = "03/28/1994 " ;
  RF13   :FlightDate = "01/00/1993 " ;
  RF14   :FlightDate = "04/02/1994 " ;
  RF15   :FlightDate = "04/04/1994 " ;
  RF16   :FlightDate = "01/00/1994 " ;
  RF18A  :FlightDate = "04/10/1993 " ;
I wasn't aware that so many of them need fixing.

   For some reason, RF03A has multiple time segments.  It shows three of
them, but the last is "-1:00:00-00:00:00."  This usually indicates that
the end time could not be found before the EOF.  I'm not sure what, if
anything, is wrong, but it may be prudent to rerun RF03A with a time slice
of 18:24:54-18:58:58.  I know that a program like `ncplot' won't be able
to access the data beyond the first time gap which occurred at 18:54:00.

   My data log file (taplog.120) is in the `120/Production' directory in
case you want to review these summary data.

Bruce,

I archived to the SCD Mass Store System (MSS) the LRT netCDF data in the
Production directory for 4-120 BASE.  I know you still need to manipulate
the date information in the netCDF headers, but this will safeguard the
data until you want to archive the corrected versions.

A current Mass Store directory list is in the file:
   /home/local/proj/archives/msfiles/msls.120

The MSS bitfile log (such as it is with incorrect and missing dates)
is in the file:  /home/local/proj/120/Production/taplog.120

There are a number of files in the `nimbus' home directory that I'd like
to move.  Can you tell me if any are yours, and, if so, what is their
purpose?  I assume that the 120 subdirectory (which I should archive) has
the special version of NIMBUS used to process your project's data.
 
Thanks.

Ron,

I don't know anything about the *zero.pts files.  I also do not have any
knowledge about the 818 directory (BOREAS?).  The 120 directory is the
BASE directory.

Chris has a program to correct the BASE date.  I haven't tried it.  I think
I have the correct dates with me but have not looked for them yet.  I may need
your help in testing that program.

Julie,

I got an email messages this morning saying that both the MSS and MIGS are
down.  I have not received word that either of them are back up.  Therefore,
I have prepared an archive job but have not submitted it yet.  I have a
MSS Advisory Committee Meeting this afternoon, so I hope to submit the job
then (hoping everything is back to normal).

Okay, I'm interested in talking to you and hearing your suggestions for
both KuDA and AIMR data. My schedule is fairly open tomorrow or early next 
week.

Julie,

I have submitted jobs to archive the remaining `aimr*.dat' files in
the directory /home/local/data.

As for the Telford project, just save the files with an unique naming
scheme, and I'll archive them in the same manner as for BASE.

Julie,

I have archived to the MSS the "last" batch of aimr*.dat files in the
`/home/data' directory.  I'm ready for Telford.

Bruce,

I just noticed that there are 3 time intervals for RF03A including the bogus
one at the end that normally indicates a lack of EOF on the raw ADS tape.
I'll discuss with Chris the possibility of splitting up this file into two
segments while omitting the bad one.  I'd like to avoid redoing the flight
with specified time intervals.  (We can leave it alone, of course, but
`ncplot' cannot access the second time interval.)

Ron,

The program to fix the NetCDF file date is ncfixhdr.  It is in the 
/home/local/dev/nimbus/src/wrk directory.

The version of nimbus that I used to process the BASE data is in the
/home/local/proj/120/Production/nimbus/src/filter directory.

XKT and XKT1 are both heinmann radiometer surface temperatures.

Julie is working on the AIMR data and will pass it on to the PI's.

Krista tells me that the MCR data can not be used.  There is no calibration
data for the MCR and there are no plans to do one that will make the BASE
data recoverable.

It looks like I need to do some archiving.  I presume all the files are
in the `/home/productiondata directory'.

Bruce just finished up the production processing yesterday, and I still have
to archive the data to our Mass Store.  When that is completed (hopefully
before the end of today), I will prepare your netCDF tape in the same format
as last time (high-density ExaByte tape with one large tar file).

I'll let you know when it is on its way to you (I would guess early next
week).

Bruce,

This email is the first of, perhaps, a few I may be sending you with
informationand/or requests for information, etc. regarding 120 BASE.

I received an email from Jim Pinto (CU) for a copy of the new data sets.  I am
now in the process of archiving all the data and support files.  I prepared a
single `tar' file of all the production netCDF data files (easy to do if they
are not too large).  I will give it to Jean Hurst to copy onto a high-density
ExaByte tape.  This will be much faster than going through the Mass Store.

I am now preparing to archive all the data and support files.  

I have some requests for you:
 1.)  You mentioned to me, in passing yesterday, that I should archive
      the program that rewrites the netCDF headers that correct the dates.
      I did not remember the name of the program or where to find it.
      Please give me that information again (including a full path name).
      Also, if there are any support files that it needed, please give me
      information on those, too.
 2.)  I would like to put a README file on the Mass Store that briefly
      summarizes this project.  Please write one and put it in the
      `...120/Production' directory.  Then I can easily archive it along
      with the other files.  To save you a lot of time, I suppose the file
      could be comprised mainly of your QC report.
 3.)  I looked in the 120RF04.cdf header and found two undefined
      variables:  XKT and XKT1.    It would be a good idea to include
      descriptions of these both in the README file and in the Project
      Summary binder that you are preparing.

Finally, some questions:
 1.)  What are your plans for the AIMR and the PMS-2D data?
 2.)  I understand that Krista cannot do anything with the MCR data.
      Is this true?
 3.)  How are you coming on the Project Summary binder?

I just thought of another question.  Which version of NIMBUS was used to

Thanks.

Bruce,

Thanks for all the information.  One further question:  When you fixed the
headers, how did you get the "correct" information to `ncfixhdr' so it
could do its job?

Ron,

The way I used the program was to be in the directory where the data file was
(/home/productiondata) and to be logged in as nimbus.  Enter the following
command

ncfixhdr FILE_NAME

You are asked for the new date which you enter and the new file is written over 
the old file.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

Bruce
