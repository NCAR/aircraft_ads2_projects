Bruce,

Any idea when I can archive the raw ADS data from BASE to the SCD Mass Store
System?

Ron,
	I'm going to create a ~nimbus/120 directory for the base processor.
I'll put all relevant code there.

Bruce,

It would help me greatly if you could give the NIMBUS output files the
following naming convention:
   120RFxx.cdf  <-- low-rate production data, where `xx' is the flight number
   120RFxxH.cdf  <-- high-rate production data, where `xx' is the flight number

I'm sure you are already aware that you need to be logged in as `nimbus,'
and that the output files go in the `/home/local/data/production' directory. 

Thanks for the update.

Bruce,

FYI

   I renamed the production output files for 4-120 BASE in the
`/home/productiondata' directory to follow my standard naming convention.
They are very similar to your names, except that I added `RF' between the
project number and flight number, and I capitalized the segment letter.
For example:  12018a.cdf  -->  120RF18A.cdf

   The following flights have no date in the netCDF header:  RF07, RF12
and RF17.  Its entry looks like this:
  RF07   :FlightDate = " " ;
  RF12   :FlightDate = " " ;
  RF17   :FlightDate = " " ;
Most of the other flights have an incorrect date:
  RF04   :FlightDate = "01/00/1994 " ;
  RF10   :FlightDate = "03/26/1994 " ;
  RF11   :FlightDate = "03/28/1994 " ;
  RF13   :FlightDate = "01/00/1993 " ;
  RF14   :FlightDate = "04/02/1994 " ;
  RF15   :FlightDate = "04/04/1994 " ;
  RF16   :FlightDate = "01/00/1994 " ;
  RF18A  :FlightDate = "04/10/1993 " ;
I wasn't aware that so many of them need fixing.

   For some reason, RF03A has multiple time segments.  It shows three of
them, but the last is "-1:00:00-00:00:00."  This usually indicates that
the end time could not be found before the EOF.  I'm not sure what, if
anything, is wrong, but it may be prudent to rerun RF03A with a time slice
of 18:24:54-18:58:58.  I know that a program like `ncplot' won't be able
to access the data beyond the first time gap which occurred at 18:54:00.

   My data log file (taplog.120) is in the `120/Production' directory in
case you want to review these summary data.

Bruce,

I archived to the SCD Mass Store System (MSS) the LRT netCDF data in the
Production directory for 4-120 BASE.  I know you still need to manipulate
the date information in the netCDF headers, but this will safeguard the
data until you want to archive the corrected versions.

A current Mass Store directory list is in the file:
   /home/local/proj/archives/msfiles/msls.120

The MSS bitfile log (such as it is with incorrect and missing dates)
is in the file:  /home/local/proj/120/Production/taplog.120

There are a number of files in the `nimbus' home directory that I'd like
to move.  Can you tell me if any are yours, and, if so, what is their
purpose?  I assume that the 120 subdirectory (which I should archive) has
the special version of NIMBUS used to process your project's data.
 
Thanks.

Ron,

I don't know anything about the *zero.pts files.  I also do not have any
knowledge about the 818 directory (BOREAS?).  The 120 directory is the
BASE directory.

Chris has a program to correct the BASE date.  I haven't tried it.  I think
I have the correct dates with me but have not looked for them yet.  I may need
your help in testing that program.

Julie,

I got an email messages this morning saying that both the MSS and MIGS are
down.  I have not received word that either of them are back up.  Therefore,
I have prepared an archive job but have not submitted it yet.  I have a
MSS Advisory Committee Meeting this afternoon, so I hope to submit the job
then (hoping everything is back to normal).

Okay, I'm interested in talking to you and hearing your suggestions for
both KuDA and AIMR data. My schedule is fairly open tomorrow or early next 
week.

Julie,

I have submitted jobs to archive the remaining `aimr*.dat' files in
the directory /home/local/data.

As for the Telford project, just save the files with an unique naming
scheme, and I'll archive them in the same manner as for BASE.

I have archived to the MSS the "last" batch of aimr*.dat files in the

Bruce,

I just noticed that there are 3 time intervals for RF03A including the bogus
one at the end that normally indicates a lack of EOF on the raw ADS tape.
I'll discuss with Chris the possibility of splitting up this file into two
segments while omitting the bad one.  I'd like to avoid redoing the flight
with specified time intervals.  (We can leave it alone, of course, but
`ncplot' cannot access the second time interval.)

It looks like I need to do some archiving.  I presume all the files are
in the `/home/productiondata directory'.

Bruce just finished up the production processing yesterday, and I still have
to archive the data to our Mass Store.  When that is completed (hopefully
before the end of today), I will prepare your netCDF tape in the same format
as last time (high-density ExaByte tape with one large tar file).

I'll let you know when it is on its way to you (I would guess early next
week).

Bruce,

This email is the first of, perhaps, a few I may be sending you with
informationand/or requests for information, etc. regarding 120 BASE.

I received an email from Jim Pinto (CU) for a copy of the new data sets.  I am
now in the process of archiving all the data and support files.  I prepared a
single `tar' file of all the production netCDF data files (easy to do if they
are not too large).  I will give it to Jean Hurst to copy onto a high-density
ExaByte tape.  This will be much faster than going through the Mass Store.

I am now preparing to archive all the data and support files.  

I have some requests for you:
 1.)  You mentioned to me, in passing yesterday, that I should archive
      the program that rewrites the netCDF headers that correct the dates.
      I did not remember the name of the program or where to find it.
      Please give me that information again (including a full path name).
      Also, if there are any support files that it needed, please give me
      information on those, too.
 2.)  I would like to put a README file on the Mass Store that briefly
      summarizes this project.  Please write one and put it in the
      `...120/Production' directory.  Then I can easily archive it along
      with the other files.  To save you a lot of time, I suppose the file
      could be comprised mainly of your QC report.
 3.)  I looked in the 120RF04.cdf header and found two undefined
      variables:  XKT and XKT1.    It would be a good idea to include
      descriptions of these both in the README file and in the Project
      Summary binder that you are preparing.

Finally, some questions:
 1.)  What are your plans for the AIMR and the PMS-2D data?
 2.)  I understand that Krista cannot do anything with the MCR data.
      Is this true?
 3.)  How are you coming on the Project Summary binder?

I just thought of another question.  Which version of NIMBUS was used to
process your data?  Was it the one in the `...120/Production/nimbus'

Thanks.

Thanks for all the information.  One further question:  When you fixed the

Ron,

The way I used the program was to be in the directory where the data file was
(/home/productiondata) and to be logged in as nimbus.  Enter the following
command

ncfixhdr FILE_NAME

You are asked for the new date which you enter and the new file is written over 
the old file.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

Bruce

I rewrote James Pinto's tar tape and it wrote fine this time, with all
the files in it.  You can tell him the tape is in the mail, if you'd like.

Judy and Jim,

The BASE flights are ready for your class.  Jim needs to contact Ron Ruth on the
best way to get a tape.  Ron's email address is ron@raf.atd.ucar.edu

Thanks for your patience.

Do you want copies of the down looking video tapes also?

Ron,

You are correct.  All the files are in the /home/production directory.

Another program to archive is /home/local/dev/nimbus/src/wrk/ncfixhdr.  This is
the program that Chris wrote to correct the date in the processed data.

I will talk to you on Monday.  Tomorrow I will be in Albuquerque.

Thanks,

Hi Ron,

Can you send the updated BASE data tape to me in the same format as
before? I believe that was netcdf, high density.

Thanks,

Jim,

The high-density ExaByte tape with one tar file having all the production
output netCDF files for the 5-120 BASE project was put in the NCAR mail
today.  Below is a list of its contents.

If all goes well, you should receive it by Friday.  Please let me know when
you receive it and if you have any problems.

Ron,

The program to fix the NetCDF file date is ncfixhdr.  It is in the 
/home/local/dev/nimbus/src/wrk directory.

The version of nimbus that I used to process the BASE data is in the
/home/local/proj/120/Production/nimbus/src/filter directory.

XKT and XKT1 are both heinmann radiometer surface temperatures.

Julie is working on the AIRM data and will pass it on to the PI's.

Krista tells me that the MCR data can not be used.  There is no calibration
data for the MCR and there are no plans to do one that will make the BASE
data recoverable.

Darrel,

James (who works with Judy Curry) already has the NIMBUS production netCDF
output data for the BASE project.  I have no idea the status of PMS-2D
processing here.  As a start, we can make copies for him of the raw ADS data
tapes.  Can you help him from there?

Please keep me informed.  Thanks.

James,

Thanks for the inquiry.  Unlike the NIMBUS data, we have not paid enough
attention to our PMS-2D processing.  I have asked Dr. Darrel Baumgardner,
our resident PMS expert, to handle this request.  I certainly can provide
you with data tapes, but Darrel is better equipped to handle the processing
or to provide you with software to do the job.

Judy,

The 20hz data is not routinely processed for all the flights.  The resulting
NetCDF files would be huge.  Let me know what flight segments you are interested
in and we will process the data for 20 hz output and get the tapes to you.  For
example the ferry between Fairbanks and the north coast of Alaska probably
doesn't contain interesting high rate data so there is no reason to process
for high rate output.

We have found that this works well as the investigator doesn't end up burried
under a mountain of data and we only do high rate data processing on data that

Judy,

Those time segments look OK.  I will start working on them.  Do you want them
all at once or in smaller groups?  Is there a priority on certain flights?

Bruce, here are the segments we are interested in for 20 Hz.  I am giving
just 1 or 2 (long) time slots for each flight we are interested in; these
could be divided further into shorter legs if you prefer (i thought this
would be easier tho)

thanks

As long as they are archived on the Mass Store they can be deleted from the 
local disk.

Bruce,

I archived to the MSS the 4 high-rate BASE netCDF files that we sent to
Jim Pinto.  (The tar file we made for them was too big to put there.)  Is
there a need to keep local versions of these files, or can I purge them
from the `/home/productiondata' directory?

I could also ask the same question for the remaining low-rate BASE netCDF
files.  These have been archived, too.  Shall I purge them?

If you have any local need for any of these, we can keep them for awhile.
I'm just trying to clean things up.

Hi Ron,

I was wondering if you could tell me the location of the
BASE data on the Mass Store. I tried to:

msread test /RAF/1994/120/LRT/RF03A and I get the error:

Fatal - msread: Attempt to read a nonexistent MSS file.

Also, is the 2d data for BASE available on the Mass Store?
If so do you happen to know it location?

Thanks,
James

James,

You almost got there.  The MSS bitfile names end with a ".cdf" extension.
Their names are of the form /RAF/1994/120/LRT/RFx.cdf, where x is
the flight number/segment (e.g., RF03A).

The PMS-2D data are in an ADS stripped-binary format without record
boundaries.  Their names on the MSS are of the form /RAF/1994/120/PMS2D/RFx
without an extension.

Here is a directory list of the BASE subdirectory /RAF/1994/120 on the MSS:

Bruce and Dick,

I just thought I'd let both of you know about a couple recent inquiries
regarding the need for additional high-rate (HRT) data for the BASE project.
Qing Wang (formerly with NCAR but now at Naval PostGraduate School) and Bill
Anderson & Ilga Paluch (MMM) have asked me for the Mass Store location of HRT
data and were quite disappointed when I told them that only a limited amount
existed.  They both intended to contact Judy Curry to see if they could
collaborate on another request for more HRT data, perhaps the entire project.
(I noticed that the original designation for this project was LRT.)

Apparently Ms. Wang has a NASA research contract, and she was looking forward
to using HRT data from BASE for it.  She also intended to discuss her needs
with Don Lenschow, who is working with her on the contract.

Judy,

Sorry for letting the second tier high rate data fall through the cracks.

We will begin processing it this week and will let you and Jim know when it
is on the mass store and when the exabye tape will be sent.

Ron,

I will begin to process the data and will let you know when I have done
each flight.  Will you then move it to the mass store and let Jim and Judy
know that it is there.  We will send an exabyte tape to Jim when all the 
flights are done or we need to more space on the disks.

Bruce,

Here is the command example for retrieving a BASE HRT MSS bitfile:

nrnet msget $MIGS/120rf07.cdf r flnm=/RAF/1994/120/HRT/RF07.2102-0110.cdf

The available HRT files on the MSS are (prefixed by /RAF/1994/120/HRT/):
  RF07.2102-0110.cdf
  RF11.2007-2140.cdf
  RF11.2321-0028.cdf

Bruce,

I perused the headers of the four BASE HRT flight segments you have produced.
For some reason incorrect dates have found their way into those for RF04
("01/00/1994" should be "09/25/1994") and RF14 ("04/02/1994" should be
"10/17/1994").  I think Chris has a program to fix these up; will you, or
should I?

Bruce,

I am preparing to rename the Mass Store bitfiles for the first BASE HRT data
set.  It will make retrieval easier out here, since I plan to use our standard
naming convention.  My only worry about doing this is that anyone who has
already gotten information about those bitfiles may now be confused because of
the name changes.  I am willing to handle any query that comes to me about it.
Should I leave the present names alone?

Concerning the most recent HRT request:
--------------------------------------
I had to correct the dates for two flights (RF16 and RF17), because they had
only a 2-digit year.  Hope everything is OK now.

I think it would be worthwhile to reprocess RF18 as two separate segments.
The LRT processing was done that way, because two separate ADS tapes were
written for that flight.  I don't suspect that NIMBUS had a problem combining
the two segments into one netCDF file, but reprocessing it would allow you to
easily examine the second segment.  If you have everything set up right, it
should be easy to redo.  What do you think?

Other than the above I'm ready to archive the files.  Please let me know.

Ron,

I will reprocess flight 18 as you suggest.

I do not have a problem with renaming the previous high rate files.  We will
get questions from anyone who tries using the old procedure and can't find the
files.

Looks good to me.

Please let me know when RF18 is again ready, and I'll archive everything.

Bruce,

I noticed that the file for RF14 was named with a "B" segment.  I assume
that was an innocent mistake and that you only processed one segment from
RF14.

If this is in error, please let me know.  Otherwise I'll archive RF14

Bruce,

I wasn't aware that something new came in.  I'll rename the Mass Store bitfile,
since it already is archived.  Is RF14A the last, or do you anticipate more?

No more.  I was looking at one of Judy Curry's early requests and noticed that
there were two time periods on the flight 14 request.  One was a higher 
priority than the other which is why it was overlooked for a while.

I have archived to the SCD Mass Store System the latest 4-120 BASE HRT

and others that they are available.

Judy and Jim,

The 20 Hz data is ready.  Ron Ruth (ron@raf.atd.ucar.EDU) is the person to
contact on retrieving the data from the MassStore or getting exabyte tapes.

A couple of quick notes.  The time periods that I processed start about 30 
minutes before your requested times.  This was done to be sure that the 
'filters' used in the GPS corrected values were stable.  GPS corrected lat and
long are at 1 second intervals because the GPS data is recorded at 1 Hz.

Flight 17 is a flight that the IRU was not performing well.  (We had a 
problem with the APU just before take-off.)  Please look at that data
very carefully befor you use it.

Ron,

I have some new AIMR data I'd like to archive on the mass store with
my other files. The files are in /home/data/aimr_data

120rf04a.scan   120rf04d.scan   120rf06c.scan   120rf07c.scan
120rf04b.scan   120rf06a.scan   120rf07a.scan   120rf11b.scan
120rf04c.scan   120rf06b.scan   120rf07b.scan   120rf12c.scan

I believe the corresponding MassStore names (according to the convention we
established previously) should be /RAF/1994/120/AIMR/TAPE/RFXXX.

Could you move these for me sometime? There's no rush. Thanks.

Julie

Bruce,

Have you yet finished up and delivered the Project Documentation Summary
for the 1994-120 BASE project?  I am preparing another issue of RAF's Data
Management News, and I need an update on the status of all projects.

Bruce,

At present there are two obsolete 4-120 BASE netCDF data sets on the SCD
Mass Store System (MSS).  The first set apparently came from the "quick-look"
data and is in a directory called PRELIM.  The second set has the original
production processing that we had to redo and is in a directory called OLDLRT.

So far as I know, we don't want these data sets in the archive, so if it's OK
with you, I will delete them.

Thanks.
