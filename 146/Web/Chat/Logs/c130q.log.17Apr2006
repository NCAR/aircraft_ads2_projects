[GMT 04/17/06 14:57:03] <knapp_ops> thanks allen
[GMT 04/17/06 14:57:15] <adsCockpit-c130> it started doing this right away after the power switch I think.
[GMT 04/17/06 14:57:37] <adsCockpit-c130> the cycle is exactly 100 seconds. you always have 5 complete cycles on the screen
[GMT 04/17/06 14:57:53] <knapp_ops> cycles of M/Z?
[GMT 04/17/06 14:57:56] <schanot_jeffco> All of those systems came up late - well after the gnd to APU power switch
[GMT 04/17/06 14:58:07] <adsCockpit-c130> if it is not too much of a problem maybe restarting the program would work??
[GMT 04/17/06 14:58:28] <knapp_ops> ok
[GMT 04/17/06 14:58:32] <knapp_ops> here's the procedure
[GMT 04/17/06 14:58:41] <adsCockpit-c130> the system seems to measure fine for 100s then all counts go to exactly zero
[GMT 04/17/06 14:58:46] <knapp_ops> are you at constant altitude?
[GMT 04/17/06 14:58:52] <adsCockpit-c130> yes
[GMT 04/17/06 14:58:58] <knapp_ops> wait wait
[GMT 04/17/06 14:59:09] <knapp_ops> if counts go to exactly zero that's a counter hardware problem
[GMT 04/17/06 14:59:15] <knapp_ops> not a system timing issue

[GMT 04/17/06 15:00:32] <adsCockpit-c130> then it measures for another 100s and then back to zeros
[GMT 04/17/06 15:00:34] <knapp_ops> so we lose 50% of data to zeroes?

[GMT 04/17/06 16:14:03] <John_Crounse_OPS> hmmm... negative on the single recording O3 masses.
[GMT 04/17/06 16:15:38] <sabl-C130> McCabe again.  Rats.  Every time I've cycled pinhole ions have decreased, so i think it is done til ground.

[GMT 04/17/06 16:25:49] <knapp_ops> ok, we can tentatively say we have O3 limping along then
