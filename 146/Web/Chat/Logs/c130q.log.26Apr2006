[GMT 04/26/06 20:24:38] <adsCockpit-c130> Jim, what about tomorrow? A flight?
[GMT 04/26/06 20:27:42] <JimCrawford-NASA> Bill,  the earlier model discussion showed significant disagreement on whether Thursday or Friday was better...we are asking the models to produce a set of self consistent curtains to decide what is best.  They should be ready soon.
[GMT 04/26/06 20:30:01] <JenMoody-ops> Bill, the northern flank of the front is very near 51N (aligned along it, oriented E-W at 51N), you will get very close, and since the front may be shifting just a bit south of 51 with time, you will probably be as good as we can get to catching what we want to see. 
[GMT 04/26/06 20:30:17] <adsCockpit-c130> Where would you go?
[GMT 04/26/06 20:30:48] <JimCrawford-NASA> was that question for me or Jennie
[GMT 04/26/06 20:31:28] <adsCockpit-c130> Jennie,  thanks.
[GMT 04/26/06 20:32:25] <adsCockpit-c130> Jim,  it was for you for the next flight.
[GMT 04/26/06 20:32:55] <JimCrawford-NASA> We are findingthat along the current track, we can't buy you much in terms of going further north...Going to 52N requires the track to be pulled too far back to the east.

We are looking to the west now to make sure we haven't overlooked anything.
