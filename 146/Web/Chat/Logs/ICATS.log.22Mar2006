[GMT 03/22/06 05:17:29] <GroundStation-DC8> much as it pains me... they did come out with a beta for Mac
[GMT 03/22/06 05:18:34] <rstickel_GT> GroundStation-DC8, any way to just get the GPS lat/lon?
[GMT 03/22/06 05:20:26] <SlamDog_N817> We are now over the H2O

[GMT 03/22/06 05:20:50] <GroundStation-DC8> Yes, but hard to describe. At the server analysis.creare.com (or outlet.creare.com if their ISP is still broke) there is a way to use munged URL's to get back a specified wind of data for specified channels. There is a crude wepage at analysis.creare.com/INTEB-B that does it for you as a demo.
[GMT 03/22/06 05:21:34] <GroundStation-DC8> wind? --> window
[GMT 03/22/06 05:21:39] <SlamDog_N817> We can put the plain jane GPS on the end of the "I" block when we are on the GRND at Moffett
[GMT 03/22/06 05:22:53] <GroundStation-DC8> Good idea, we used to do that for AIRSAR
[GMT 03/22/06 05:25:14] <rstickel_GT> GroundStation-DC8, when I hit the creare site, I get a mesage that INTEX-B is not available

[GMT 03/22/06 09:19:38] <SlamDog_N817> We are cutting the corner and NOT going all the way to PT10
[GMT 03/22/06 09:19:55] <SlamDog_N817> We now are about an hour east of ECA
[GMT 03/22/06 09:20:19] <SlamDog_N817> or about 90 min from Moffett
[GMT 03/22/06 09:20:29] <GroundStation_DC8> nice short cut - seems like you're running late anyway
[GMT 03/22/06 09:20:41] <SlamDog_N817> we are low on gass
[GMT 03/22/06 09:21:18] <SlamDog_N817> Something about bucking a lot of wind on the first half
[GMT 03/22/06 09:21:39] <GroundStation_DC8> is half the plane asleep?
[GMT 03/22/06 09:22:06] <SlamDog_N817> and the other half wishes they were asleep
[GMT 03/22/06 09:22:42] <SlamDog_N817> Donney, Rudy, and EVB are about the only ones that I have NOT seen nod off
[GMT 03/22/06 09:22:50] <GroundStation_DC8> no doubt. Jet lag effects added also.
[GMT 03/22/06 09:24:55] <GroundStation_DC8> Don't think I've ever seen EVB asleep on a flight. all those long ozone missions.
[GMT 03/22/06 09:25:09] <SlamDog_N817> So are we going to run a stop watch on future flights to see if it is a time issue that has the 10 channel going off?
[GMT 03/22/06 09:26:05] <GroundStation_DC8> yeah, we should. Of course a real OS would keep log files. Oh well
[GMT 03/22/06 09:26:20] <SlamDog_N817> I just checked and he does NOT have any tooth picks holding his eye lids open
[GMT 03/22/06 09:27:08] <SlamDog_N817> You mean a real OS has a /var/log so that one can make log files?
[GMT 03/22/06 09:27:14] <SlamDog_N817> What a KEWL idea
[GMT 03/22/06 09:27:42] <SlamDog_N817> I wish I had come up with something KEWL like that ;-)
[GMT 03/22/06 09:28:08] <GroundStation_DC8> unfortunately now that it sort of works Sky will not want to switch until after the mission if then
[GMT 03/22/06 09:28:08] <SlamDog_N817> 40 min to ECA
[GMT 03/22/06 09:29:47] SlamDog_N817 (Sky@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Read error: Connection reset by peer
[GMT 03/22/06 09:34:10] SlamDog_N817 (Sky@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &ICATS.
[GMT 03/22/06 09:34:44] <SlamDog_N817> Hello World
[GMT 03/22/06 09:34:56] <GroundStation_DC8> another 10-channel hose job?
[GMT 03/22/06 09:35:07] <SlamDog_N817> NO I'm not sure
[GMT 03/22/06 09:35:21] <SlamDog_N817> I came back and I was all red on the dash
[GMT 03/22/06 09:35:33] <SlamDog_N817> I typed Hello World
[GMT 03/22/06 09:36:06] <SlamDog_N817> I'm switching to the 10 channel and see what's on the blue screen
[GMT 03/22/06 09:36:25] <GroundStation_DC8> maybe it was the bandwidth-limiting thing, - but that would leave one green
[GMT 03/22/06 09:36:56] <GroundStation_DC8> maybe it was the bandwidth-limiting thing but then then one green got dropped accidently by Iridium also?
[GMT 03/22/06 09:37:22] <SlamDog_N817> I had to cleick o Accept
[GMT 03/22/06 09:37:47] <SlamDog_N817> that's click on Accept
[GMT 03/22/06 09:37:57] <GroundStation_DC8> Hmmm so it redialed itself from scratch for some reason
[GMT 03/22/06 09:38:03] <SlamDog_N817> NO redial
[GMT 03/22/06 09:38:07] <SlamDog_N817> NO reboot
[GMT 03/22/06 09:38:16] <GroundStation_DC8> even weirder
[GMT 03/22/06 09:38:34] <SlamDog_N817> I'm off to do a map thing
[GMT 03/22/06 09:39:29] <SlamDog_N817> I'm back
[GMT 03/22/06 09:40:39] <SlamDog_N817> It looks like we are using 9 modems
[GMT 03/22/06 09:40:40] <GroundStation_DC8> you are currently over the absolute middle of nowhere
[GMT 03/22/06 09:41:47] <SlamDog_N817> They are starting to talk about the in flight debriefing
[GMT 03/22/06 09:42:03] <SlamDog_N817> They are turning lights on to wake folks up
[GMT 03/22/06 09:42:35] <SlamDog_N817> OH ... I have been in the middle of nowhere and this is NOT it
[GMT 03/22/06 09:42:36] <SlamDog_N817> It
[GMT 03/22/06 09:42:51] <SlamDog_N817> It's way to dark to be in the middle 
[GMT 03/22/06 09:43:35] <GroundStation_DC8> I mention that besause 50 is "the loneliest road in the world" and you are between it and 6, which I can only assume is even lonelier
[GMT 03/22/06 09:43:56] <GroundStation_DC8> Course I bet the outback has it all over Nevada
[GMT 03/22/06 09:44:49] <SlamDog_N817> The best time to cross either of the two Dakotas is in the middle of the night
[GMT 03/22/06 09:45:48] <GroundStation_DC8> not to spend a month or three there in the middle of winter?
[GMT 03/22/06 09:46:47] <GroundStation_DC8> actually I enjoyed it for the 2 weeks I was there. Not much to do tho
[GMT 03/22/06 09:47:19] <SlamDog_N817> It was that time of year with only COLD things to do
[GMT 03/22/06 09:48:21] <GroundStation_DC8> Well I kind of wish I was there to pull the boxes off the airplane instead of leaving them locked in for three weeks, but that's okay. I'll do the postflight in three weeks when we all reconvene at Ames
[GMT 03/22/06 09:50:16] <SlamDog_N817> We are debriefing
[GMT 03/22/06 09:50:35] <SlamDog_N817> We are about to cross over into CA airspace
[GMT 03/22/06 09:50:53] <GroundStation_DC8> "reveal worked fine"
[GMT 03/22/06 09:51:17] <SlamDog_N817> That's what I said
[GMT 03/22/06 09:51:36] <GroundStation_DC8> thx
[GMT 03/22/06 09:51:47] <SlamDog_N817> I also mentioned we had to redial the 10 channel more than we would like to
[GMT 03/22/06 09:51:51] <GroundStation_DC8> looks like you're aiming for Modesto
[GMT 03/22/06 09:52:23] <SlamDog_N817> We are aiming for "HOOKS"
[GMT 03/22/06 09:53:04] <SlamDog_N817> We are dropping Crossing 28
[GMT 03/22/06 09:53:16] <SlamDog_N817> Wrong
[GMT 03/22/06 09:53:23] <SlamDog_N817> crossing 36
[GMT 03/22/06 09:53:53] <SlamDog_N817> going to do maps
[GMT 03/22/06 09:55:16] <SlamDog_N817> Ok 
[GMT 03/22/06 09:55:28] <SlamDog_N817> Nothing happened while I was gone
[GMT 03/22/06 09:56:08] <SlamDog_N817> 19 min to HOOKS
[GMT 03/22/06 09:57:37] <GroundStation_DC8> so your flight leaves at 5AM or something? with connections to GF? yikes. hope you get some sleep.
[GMT 03/22/06 09:58:03] <SlamDog_N817> We should find out if the 10 channel has an altidue issue with this inprogess ramp
[GMT 03/22/06 09:58:17] <SlamDog_N817> NO they changed the ticket
[GMT 03/22/06 09:58:29] <SlamDog_N817> I now get a days sleep
[GMT 03/22/06 09:58:49] <SlamDog_N817> I go out at 0640 on the 23rd
[GMT 03/22/06 09:58:55] <GroundStation_DC8> thats good. 
[GMT 03/22/06 09:59:39] <SlamDog_N817> crossing 26
[GMT 03/22/06 10:00:23] <SlamDog_N817> 15 min to HOOKS
[GMT 03/22/06 10:01:42] <SlamDog_N817> They say seatbelts at HOOKS
[GMT 03/22/06 10:02:03] <SlamDog_N817> leaving 24
[GMT 03/22/06 10:03:35] <SlamDog_N817> I'm logging off
[GMT 03/22/06 10:03:47] <SlamDog_N817> and turning off the 10 channel
