[GMT 04/26/06 00:10:58] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Hello at DFRC
[GMT 04/26/06 00:11:18] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Sky and Larry here in HI.
[GMT 04/26/06 00:12:07] <GTRDC-DFRC> Hi Sky and Larry
[GMT 04/26/06 00:12:13] <GTRDC-DFRC> This is Carl in the NOC
[GMT 04/26/06 00:12:47] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Scott is not on right now, their location is giving iridium fits at the moment
[GMT 04/26/06 00:13:08] <GTRDC-DFRC> I noticed the reveal box also just redialed
[GMT 04/26/06 00:13:57] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> yea, this is the forth time since take off and all in the last hour
[GMT 04/26/06 00:15:25] <GTRDC-DFRC> Maybe they were spiraling in a spot with poor link geometery
[GMT 04/26/06 00:15:50] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> They just did a spiral, but all this started before the spiral.
[GMT 04/26/06 00:16:15] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> I agree it most likely is something to do with link geometery.
[GMT 04/26/06 00:16:51] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Gloria is or has already ordered the items you requested for REVEAL.
[GMT 04/26/06 00:17:36] <GTRDC-DFRC> excellent, now I just have to design the card in the next day or two
[GMT 04/26/06 00:18:10] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Who's making the card?  That on-line place we used for the other ones?
[GMT 04/26/06 00:18:26] <GTRDC-DFRC> yeah that's the plan
[GMT 04/26/06 00:18:52] <GTRDC-DFRC> because they take native eagle files, it's easier
[GMT 04/26/06 00:19:15] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Okay, but as of now we can't order until Monday, and that would be only if Susan has money on the credit card then.
[GMT 04/26/06 00:19:40] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> If we need to order before that let me know I'll work something else out.
[GMT 04/26/06 00:21:16] <GTRDC-DFRC> okay. We now have an Arcata procurement process also, but they discourage fast work so I'd rather not bother trying them
[GMT 04/26/06 00:22:05] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> So how do you like the NOC setup?  Easy enough to use?
[GMT 04/26/06 00:22:47] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> I have most of the equipment for your remote setup so you'll have full NOC access at your desk.
[GMT 04/26/06 00:23:14] <GTRDC-DFRC> It's really nice. I don't know what a lot of stuff is for yet, or which what is where. I watched larry use the remote access, it is goning to be very very helpful.
[GMT 04/26/06 00:29:07] <GTRDC-DFRC> So I take it you are not on board? Is that for UC-LIF to have another seat, or did it just make more sense to try it from the ground?
[GMT 04/26/06 00:30:57] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> All seats were requested.  I could have pushed to fly, but it really didn't make sense.
[GMT 04/26/06 00:31:36] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> In fact Marty is grounded and they haven't given his seat away to an investigator and they have both jump seats in the cockpit.
[GMT 04/26/06 00:31:38] <GTRDC-DFRC> makes sense, I mean I agree
[GMT 04/26/06 00:32:21] <GTRDC-DFRC> I backed out of all the transits for that reason also

[GMT 04/26/06 00:39:14] <ICATS_DC8> Hello World
[GMT 04/26/06 00:39:22] <ICATS_DC8> I'm back from my nap
[GMT 04/26/06 00:39:22] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Your back
[GMT 04/26/06 00:39:36] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Carl's logged in from DFRC
[GMT 04/26/06 00:40:18] <GTRDC-DFRC> Hey Dr Scott!
[GMT 04/26/06 00:42:22] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Scott, give me a link that you are using for Henry's maps that you are downloading, Larry would like to put one in his briefing.  Thanks.
[GMT 04/26/06 00:43:41] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Carl, in helping Scott troublesoot the new printer, I logged into REVEAL and then ftp'd to the printer to verified it worked.  That went great!
[GMT 04/26/06 00:44:28] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> So that means if need be we could print a .ps file on the plane from the ground.
[GMT 04/26/06 00:44:33] <GTRDC-DFRC> Sky/Larry, I'm reviewing the GA prints for Fire. They show the quadra line joining the main octupus and arriving at GZ/OZ via pins on the same cannon plug as the RS422 data from GZ/OZ, instead of an RJ45. Was there a change I didn't here about?
[GMT 04/26/06 00:45:23] <GTRDC-DFRC> Re: printing, probably some practical joke value there.
[GMT 04/26/06 00:46:11] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> yup
[GMT 04/26/06 00:47:03] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> We're looking at the print.  I think it is a mistake.
[GMT 04/26/06 00:47:30] <ICATS_DC8> http://aviationweather.gov/obs/sat/intl/
[GMT 04/26/06 00:47:38] <ICATS_DC8> We grab area "M"
[GMT 04/26/06 00:50:28] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Thank you.
[GMT 04/26/06 00:51:05] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Carl, which print or document are you looking at specifically, there are a few of them.  The latest one I got from Jamie today doesnt' show that.
[GMT 04/26/06 00:53:47] <ICATS_DC8> OK
[GMT 04/26/06 00:53:58] <ICATS_DC8> The RudMAN can copy :O)
[GMT 04/26/06 00:54:33] <GTRDC-DFRC> This is the latest one from Jamie that he sent as a pdf, which I forwarded to Glo to print for me since Linux didn't understand the fancy fonts
[GMT 04/26/06 00:55:16] <ICATS_DC8> Sky ---- looks like the RudMan's BNC pull and reconnect has helped with the Cryo issue
[GMT 04/26/06 00:55:50] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Scott, great.  Keep that fix in you bag of tricks.
[GMT 04/26/06 00:56:58] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Carl, ok I think that is the one I'm looking at two.  It shows the eth going to REVEAL J5 which is correct, it is labled wrong on the AltAir plug side as J1, should be 5.
[GMT 04/26/06 00:57:27] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> oops I said J1 I meant P1 and should be P5 for the eth cable.
[GMT 04/26/06 00:59:23] <GTRDC-DFRC> well their numbering is screwy but consistent sort of, they number all their P's from one up whatever they are plugged into
[GMT 04/26/06 00:59:59] <GTRDC-DFRC> are you looking at just the first page; the good stuff is down around page 25 or 30
[GMT 04/26/06 01:01:44] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> OH, I don't have THAT document.  Larry has it and is sending it over to me now.  Then I'll look where you are refering too.
[GMT 04/26/06 01:12:13] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> I don't see the concern you are looking at.  Page 22 looks fine to me.  Which specific page are you on?

[GMT 04/26/06 01:18:23] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Don't know, but looks like he's back
[GMT 04/26/06 01:18:24] <GTRDC-DFRC> stoopid screensaver
[GMT 04/26/06 01:18:43] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> It's required, sorry.
[GMT 04/26/06 01:19:41] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> So Carl, as I was saying before you got kicked, I don't see the concern you pointed out, looking at page 22 and around there the number and such look okay, so can you be more specific?
[GMT 04/26/06 01:20:30] <GTRDC-DFRC> but of course. It would be nice to make xchat resist this so we could lok traffic
[GMT 04/26/06 01:20:38] <GTRDC-DFRC> lok? --> log
[GMT 04/26/06 01:21:17] <GTRDC-DFRC> Re: Altair, REVEAL J5 -> GC/OZ P6, not an RJ45
[GMT 04/26/06 01:21:53] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Well just turn off the screen saver during flights, right click the desktop and select properties and turn it off.
[GMT 04/26/06 01:22:27] <GTRDC-DFRC> but that would be cheating !!!
[GMT 04/26/06 01:23:40] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Yup and during flights I guess we should especially inside the locked DC, oh well.
[GMT 04/26/06 01:24:02] <ICATS_DC8> I see that Even REVEAL has to redial
[GMT 04/26/06 01:24:28] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> I see your point, Larry confirms that Jim Elkins said different, that they did have an RJ45, so yes this needs to be pointed out and investigated.
[GMT 04/26/06 01:24:41] <GTRDC-DFRC> Scott, how can you tell?
[GMT 04/26/06 01:24:57] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Scott, on occassion just like the multi-channel, iridium does go in and out.
[GMT 04/26/06 01:25:24] <ICATS_DC8> I go to KVM #8
[GMT 04/26/06 01:25:27] <ICATS_DC8> I look at the screen
[GMT 04/26/06 01:26:39] <GTRDC-DFRC> but that would be cheating !!!
[GMT 04/26/06 01:27:04] <ICATS_DC8> It says connect time 36 min
[GMT 04/26/06 01:27:05] <ICATS_DC8> We have been in the air longer than
[GMT 04/26/06 01:27:10] <ICATS_DC8> It also says modem hangup
[GMT 04/26/06 01:27:14] <ICATS_DC8> It's NOT how you play the game!
[GMT 04/26/06 01:27:20] <ICATS_DC8> It's that U R in the game
[GMT 04/26/06 01:27:32] <ICATS_DC8> RULES :-(
[GMT 04/26/06 01:27:43] <ICATS_DC8> Get the job DONE!
[GMT 04/26/06 01:28:06] <GTRDC-DFRC> damn straight
[GMT 04/26/06 01:29:07] <ICATS_DC8> Don't waiste my time with rules when we could be working on tools
[GMT 04/26/06 01:29:27] <ICATS_DC8> going down
[GMT 04/26/06 01:31:30] <GTRDC-DFRC> looking in the log files, looks like it's had a few redials this flight, nothing speial though
[GMT 04/26/06 01:32:17] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Hey guys, REVEAL is not sending any data
[GMT 04/26/06 01:32:25] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> tcpdump is void
[GMT 04/26/06 01:32:32] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Is REVEAL in a panic mode
[GMT 04/26/06 01:33:30] <GTRDC-DFRC> if it is, dont reset until getting a good look at the screen
[GMT 04/26/06 01:33:42] <ICATS_DC8> REVEAL looks good on the bird
[GMT 04/26/06 01:34:03] <ICATS_DC8> I have a login prompt
[GMT 04/26/06 01:34:18] <GTRDC-DFRC> there is no link right now, must have heard me talking about it :(
[GMT 04/26/06 01:34:23] <ICATS_DC8> 1.17 amps
[GMT 04/26/06 01:34:31] <ICATS_DC8> 28.0 volts
[GMT 04/26/06 01:35:22] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Carl are you logging into REVEAL to look around?
[GMT 04/26/06 01:37:32] <GTRDC-DFRC> I was logged in but almost zero activity. The link dropped about 10 minutes ago. Must be having trouble reconnecting. Or it could be that case where pppd does not give up for awhile thus delaying it's restart, we saw that one before.
[GMT 04/26/06 01:38:17] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> If you look at the localmessages file it hung up correctly, but if you look at mgettymodem the modem is still connected.
[GMT 04/26/06 01:39:24] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> So the problem to me appears to be our modem on inbound, you might want to recycle it.  Located on at far right station, front side, open door (if locked the key is in the key box by front door)
[GMT 04/26/06 01:39:51] <GTRDC-DFRC> so maybe it's a dryden phone system problem. remember I discovered last night that if the modem's busy you don't hear a busy signal, it just rings forever.
[GMT 04/26/06 01:39:52] <ICATS_DC8> Want to cyle power?
[GMT 04/26/06 01:39:57] <GTRDC-DFRC> no!
[GMT 04/26/06 01:40:02] <ICATS_DC8> Standing bye
[GMT 04/26/06 01:40:08] <GTRDC-DFRC> thanks!
[GMT 04/26/06 01:40:38] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> could be, try calling the phone number and see if it rings
[GMT 04/26/06 01:40:48] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> 7643?
[GMT 04/26/06 01:40:49] <GTRDC-DFRC> Sky, where do I unplug the modem to force hangup?
[GMT 04/26/06 01:41:04] <GTRDC-DFRC> 2486?
[GMT 04/26/06 01:41:06] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> The power plug on the modem/
[GMT 04/26/06 01:41:14] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Yes
[GMT 04/26/06 01:41:16] <GTRDC-DFRC> where's the modem?
[GMT 04/26/06 01:41:43] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> far right station, front side, lower door, if locked key in key box by front door
[GMT 04/26/06 01:43:05] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> The modem gives a busy signal from here.  So it is connected to something
[GMT 04/26/06 01:44:36] <GTRDC-DFRC> from the lab phone it just rang (earpiece) forever while not ringing (modem)
[GMT 04/26/06 01:44:54] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> okay, sounds like reset time.
[GMT 04/26/06 01:44:59] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> for the modem
[GMT 04/26/06 01:45:40] <GTRDC-DFRC> okay I unplugged power and line, all but one light went out and mgetty.modem recycled, now waiting...
[GMT 04/26/06 01:46:28] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Excellent, so now we'll see if REVEAL phones home again soon
[GMT 04/26/06 01:48:06] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Interesting anomaly we need investigated.  You called the modem and it rang forever, I called the modem and got a busy signal, what's the difference.  I'll contact the phone people and find out what up.
[GMT 04/26/06 01:49:04] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Scott, how's REVEAL looking now?  What does the screen say?
[GMT 04/26/06 01:50:04] <ICATS_DC8> nothing has changed at my end
[GMT 04/26/06 01:50:11] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> ok
[GMT 04/26/06 01:50:51] <ICATS_DC8> I'm off to grab Hank another image
[GMT 04/26/06 01:51:26] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Carl, any idea why REVEAL hasn't phoned home yet?
[GMT 04/26/06 01:51:55] <GTRDC-DFRC> maybe airborne pppd is not giving up for a long time (like we saw before) and it's related to the anomaly on the ground where pppd dropped but the modem didn't
[GMT 04/26/06 01:52:51] <ICATS_DC8> sounds like a really sorry heart beat
[GMT 04/26/06 01:53:39] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> okay, sitting by waiting.....
[GMT 04/26/06 01:55:47] <GTRDC-DFRC> I tired calling the quiescent modem from a dryden line again, still rang forever - meaning it's some cisco wierdness where it's too smart.
[GMT 04/26/06 01:56:02] <GTRDC-DFRC> Sky, could you please try calling 2486 again from there?
[GMT 04/26/06 01:56:40] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Did you recycle both modems in there or just the one, I had moved them around doing testing once and now don't exactly remember which is which
[GMT 04/26/06 01:57:31] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> The modem is answering just fine, that was me calling it.
[GMT 04/26/06 01:57:36] <GTRDC-DFRC> Scott could call it from the aircraft using the overhead courtesy phone as well
[GMT 04/26/06 01:58:29] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Carl, I forgot, I know why the modem line constantly rings from the DFRC phone it has to do with the VoIP.  From a DFRC phone you can't call a modem.
[GMT 04/26/06 01:58:30] <GTRDC-DFRC> whoever did whatever, the modem rang and connect failed
[GMT 04/26/06 01:58:50] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Yes, that was me testing the modem
[GMT 04/26/06 01:59:21] <GTRDC-DFRC> for the record it was labeled 2486
[GMT 04/26/06 01:59:35] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Ok, soon to be corrected
[GMT 04/26/06 02:00:10] <GTRDC-DFRC> corrected why? isn't it already correct?
[GMT 04/26/06 02:00:24] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> no, the phone number is 7643
[GMT 04/26/06 02:02:19] <GTRDC-DFRC> Roger, that's what I see in the backups
[GMT 04/26/06 02:04:16] <GTRDC-DFRC> Scott, please give me a call at 0016612765313 (the NOC) if you have a minute
[GMT 04/26/06 02:07:11] <ICATS_DC8> I'm back
[GMT 04/26/06 02:08:43] <ICATS_DC8> the phone says "registering"
[GMT 04/26/06 02:08:57] <ICATS_DC8> now "iridium"
[GMT 04/26/06 02:09:46] <ICATS_DC8> i just punch in your number
[GMT 04/26/06 02:09:46] <ICATS_DC8> and
[GMT 04/26/06 02:09:47] <ICATS_DC8> ok

[GMT 04/26/06 02:14:35] <GTRDC-DFRC> Scott, please try "ifconfig" and see if ppp0 is listed
[GMT 04/26/06 02:14:51] <ICATS_DC8> I was in /var/log
[GMT 04/26/06 02:14:53] <ICATS_DC8> dmesg

[GMT 04/26/06 02:16:15] <ICATS_DC8> eth1 is up
[GMT 04/26/06 02:18:34] <ICATS_DC8> yes pp0 is listed
[GMT 04/26/06 02:18:47] <ICATS_DC8> the tail 
[GMT 04/26/06 02:18:52] <ICATS_DC8> looks like it thinks every thing is happy
[GMT 04/26/06 02:19:26] <ICATS_DC8> 06:59 was the last ppp line
[GMT 04/26/06 02:20:03] <GTRDC-DFRC> Scott, please do "ps  -e |grep ppp" and see if ppp is actually running
[GMT 04/26/06 02:20:04] <ICATS_DC8> Deflate (15) compresion enabled
[GMT 04/26/06 02:20:56] <ICATS_DC8> 1371 ?  00:00:00 pppd
[GMT 04/26/06 02:21:26] <GTRDC-DFRC> the plot thickens
[GMT 04/26/06 02:22:42] <ICATS_DC8> in /etc/rc.d/init
[GMT 04/26/06 02:22:50] <ICATS_DC8> what's ppp
[GMT 04/26/06 02:22:53] <GTRDC-DFRC> like you say, it seems ppp thinks it's working and happy even though the other end is being remarkably quiet. Maybe a race condition between the air/ground ppp instances.
[GMT 04/26/06 02:22:58] <ICATS_DC8> i can not ./ppp status
[GMT 04/26/06 02:23:32] <GTRDC-DFRC> Scott, please try "pkill ppp" to kill it; it should auto-restart in about a minute
[GMT 04/26/06 02:24:04] <GTRDC-DFRC> I don't know that command "./ppp status"
[GMT 04/26/06 02:24:43] <ICATS_DC8> said I had 137.1 min of connect time
[GMT 04/26/06 02:25:06] <GTRDC-DFRC> so it thought it was doing fine until you went and killed it
[GMT 04/26/06 02:26:55] <ICATS_DC8> I have a eth0 and eth2 in ifconfig
[GMT 04/26/06 02:26:59] <ICATS_DC8> and I did NOT have a licence to kill any ppps
[GMT 04/26/06 02:27:24] <ICATS_DC8> still NO ppps in iffconfig
[GMT 04/26/06 02:27:40] <GTRDC-DFRC> it might take awhile
[GMT 04/26/06 02:27:55] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Scott, Larry is curious where are you exactly, lat / long

[GMT 04/26/06 02:29:21] GTCIMS_DC8 (Saewung@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Quit: Leaving
[GMT 04/26/06 02:30:01] <ICATS_DC8> up on top 
[GMT 04/26/06 02:30:07] <ICATS_DC8> crossed pt17
[GMT 04/26/06 02:30:44] <ICATS_DC8> NO change in ifconfig
[GMT 04/26/06 02:30:58] <GTRDC-DFRC> sigh
[GMT 04/26/06 02:31:08] <ICATS_DC8> 36K something like 2 hours out
[GMT 04/26/06 02:31:09] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Carl, shouldn't he check for sleep?
[GMT 04/26/06 02:31:23] <ICATS_DC8> Yes I need some more sleep
[GMT 04/26/06 02:31:28] <GTRDC-DFRC> Scott, try "ps -e" and look for ppp and/or run_iridium
[GMT 04/26/06 02:32:44] <ICATS_DC8> 1371 ?    00:00:00   pppd
[GMT 04/26/06 02:33:19] <ICATS_DC8> 1369  ?  00:00:00 run_iridium
[GMT 04/26/06 02:33:40] <GTRDC-DFRC> extra credit: try "strace -p 1371" and see what's up; be ready with the <ctrl-c> in case it's fast
[GMT 04/26/06 02:33:53] <ICATS_DC8> why did I NOT  "kill -9 1371" ?
[GMT 04/26/06 02:34:23] <GTRDC-DFRC> arrggh, I now hear what you're saying.
[GMT 04/26/06 02:34:53] <GTRDC-DFRC> You are correct of course. but try the strace anyway to see what it's stuck on
[GMT 04/26/06 02:35:13] <ICATS_DC8> "strace" NOT "trace"?
[GMT 04/26/06 02:35:30] <GTRDC-DFRC> right, "strace".
[GMT 04/26/06 02:35:40] <GTRDC-DFRC> "ltrace" is also fun
[GMT 04/26/06 02:37:09] <GTRDC-DFRC> modem looged in!
[GMT 04/26/06 02:37:25] <ICATS_DC8> we have a new pppd it's  at 1457
[GMT 04/26/06 02:37:44] <ICATS_DC8> we have a ppp in ifconfig
[GMT 04/26/06 02:38:57] <ICATS_DC8> want me to log off the REVEAL box now?
[GMT 04/26/06 02:39:16] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Great work.
[GMT 04/26/06 02:39:37] <ICATS_DC8> why do get sorry time stamps in ps -e?
[GMT 04/26/06 02:40:09] <GTRDC-DFRC> don't matter to me, you fixed it, just please don't break it again ;)
[GMT 04/26/06 02:40:46] <GTRDC-DFRC> timestamps: I think that's cpu time used, not time of day
[GMT 04/26/06 02:41:18] <GTRDC-DFRC> Did you kill it before strace (I'm curious)
[GMT 04/26/06 02:42:07] <ICATS_DC8> I did do one strace 
[GMT 04/26/06 02:42:08] <ICATS_DC8> and
[GMT 04/26/06 02:42:11] <ICATS_DC8> it scared me
[GMT 04/26/06 02:42:32] <ICATS_DC8> I have no idea what was scrolling all over the screan
[GMT 04/26/06 02:42:35] <GTRDC-DFRC> ROTFL
[GMT 04/26/06 02:43:01] <ICATS_DC8> I figured I was NOT really to use strace
[GMT 04/26/06 02:43:14] <GTRDC-DFRC> can't say i didn't warn you
[GMT 04/26/06 02:43:28] <ICATS_DC8> it was all junk
[GMT 04/26/06 02:43:34] <ICATS_DC8> and
[GMT 04/26/06 02:43:41] <ICATS_DC8> I was never going to xchat it 2 U
[GMT 04/26/06 02:44:02] <ICATS_DC8> I could have cat it to a file for you
[GMT 04/26/06 02:44:07] <GTRDC-DFRC> but since it was doing _something_ it means it was not truely hung, just misdirected
[GMT 04/26/06 02:44:23] <ICATS_DC8> 35 min to PT18
[GMT 04/26/06 02:45:03] <ICATS_DC8> it was broke!
[GMT 04/26/06 02:45:50] <GTRDC-DFRC> it was a victim of modem society
[GMT 04/26/06 02:46:16] <ICATS_DC8> It all started in FL!
[GMT 04/26/06 02:46:54] <ICATS_DC8> maybe the modem was working just fine
[GMT 04/26/06 02:46:56] <ICATS_DC8> and
[GMT 04/26/06 02:47:05] <ICATS_DC8> The REVEAL code was hosed
[GMT 04/26/06 02:47:16] <GTRDC-DFRC> watch it....
[GMT 04/26/06 02:47:18] <ICATS_DC8> The modem needs a GOOD lawer
[GMT 04/26/06 02:48:08] <ICATS_DC8> LF should have been mad
[GMT 04/26/06 02:48:23] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> It was probably inbound, disconnected incorrectly and never caused the modem to send the reset signal
[GMT 04/26/06 02:48:28] <ICATS_DC8> We 3 burning 11 sat links and nothing 2 show 4 it
[GMT 04/26/06 02:49:36] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Lots to show for it, great team work in troubleshooting a system that is out in the middle of the pacific, airborne with ground people in HI and CA
[GMT 04/26/06 02:49:45] <ICATS_DC8> @ 36k and heading back to Hickam
[GMT 04/26/06 02:50:11] <ICATS_DC8> phluff
[GMT 04/26/06 02:50:34] <GTRDC-DFRC> nah, this was a good exercise - we need stomp these outlier ppp problems
[GMT 04/26/06 02:50:52] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> exactly
[GMT 04/26/06 02:51:21] <ICATS_DC8> How many ice teas did I have last night?
[GMT 04/26/06 02:51:39] <GTRDC-DFRC> FYI the modem (before I unplugged it) had more than one light one, after it had only one light on. As if it was busy with something.
[GMT 04/26/06 02:51:43] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> I wasn't counting mine why should I have counted yours?
[GMT 04/26/06 02:51:58] <GTRDC-DFRC> Long Island style?
[GMT 04/26/06 02:52:07] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> yes
[GMT 04/26/06 02:52:43] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Modem, yea it was hung for some reason.  I wonder if switching to the newer modems I bought for us might fix this.
[GMT 04/26/06 02:53:21] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> It may have to do with the way inbound terminates a session from within due to non-response of the other end.
[GMT 04/26/06 02:53:36] <GTRDC-DFRC> I had sleepytime tea at 3am after driving home - your version sounds much more fun
[GMT 04/26/06 02:54:03] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> It might not be causing the modem to let go of the phone line correctly.  Which is why you saw the extra lights.
[GMT 04/26/06 02:54:36] <GTRDC-DFRC> PPP driver has a lot of options dealing with these sorts of things, doesn't it? I remember we fixed a lot of first-order problems that way
[GMT 04/26/06 02:54:48] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> yes
[GMT 04/26/06 02:55:46] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> I've had similar problems with modems in computers on phone lines like this problem before.  Like loosing my dial tone at home when not connected to the internet, but had to recycle the modem to get the dial tone back for the phone.
[GMT 04/26/06 02:56:37] <ICATS_DC8> the modem is holding the "off hook"
[GMT 04/26/06 02:56:47] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> something like that
[GMT 04/26/06 02:57:05] <ICATS_DC8> do you have "A" lead control at home?
[GMT 04/26/06 02:57:22] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> huh?
[GMT 04/26/06 02:57:23] <ICATS_DC8> That's what lights the light in a 5 key system
[GMT 04/26/06 02:58:10] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Your speaking greek
[GMT 04/26/06 02:58:12] <ICATS_DC8> you might check your tip and ring to see if you have them crossed in the house
[GMT 04/26/06 02:58:40] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Been there, done that.  But no problems anymore, no more modems, DSL now.
[GMT 04/26/06 02:58:57] <GTRDC-DFRC> Even if it's inbound's fault, we need some way to reset ppp on reveal in case of these kind of problems - similar trouble could happen for other reasons (routing problems on the ground segment, whatever)
[GMT 04/26/06 02:58:59] <ICATS_DC8> it's ammmmazing what you can learn by having a hunting buddy with 25 years with bell south
[GMT 04/26/06 02:59:25] <GTRDC-DFRC> Is he in the Pioneers?
[GMT 04/26/06 02:59:38] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Yes, exactly.  So more learing of PPP and it's commands.
[GMT 04/26/06 03:00:52] <GTRDC-DFRC> or is the Pioneers just a Pacific Bell thing?
[GMT 04/26/06 03:00:59] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> It is a very good possibility that the modems were still connected during that time, even if they weren't properly communicating.
[GMT 04/26/06 03:01:58] <GTRDC-DFRC> Could be. Recall ppp0 did not exist, and pppd was not running, maybe pppd on inbound was fooled somehow.
[GMT 04/26/06 03:03:28] <ICATS_DC8> not sure about the "Pioneers" sounds like a west coast thing
[GMT 04/26/06 03:04:56] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Scott said ppp0 did exist and pppd was running, that was the 1371 PID.  Scroll back and see the conversation or am I miss reading what Scott said?
[GMT 04/26/06 03:07:24] <ICATS_DC8> yes I recall saying that pppd was running withOUT ppp0 in ifconfig
[GMT 04/26/06 03:08:29] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Scott at one time you said ppp0 was there, was that from a log file or somewhere else.
[GMT 04/26/06 03:09:01] <ICATS_DC8> it was there when I 1st looked at ifconfig
[GMT 04/26/06 03:09:10] <ICATS_DC8> we killed something
[GMT 04/26/06 03:09:22] <ICATS_DC8> pppd had a PID
[GMT 04/26/06 03:09:24] <ICATS_DC8> and
[GMT 04/26/06 03:09:35] <ICATS_DC8> there was NO ppp in ifconfig
[GMT 04/26/06 03:10:02] <ICATS_DC8> I  did NOT "kill -9 the pppd"
[GMT 04/26/06 03:11:16] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Scott, try sending me a small file via XChat, please
[GMT 04/26/06 03:11:30] <ICATS_DC8> did you know that running e2fsck is reccomened
[GMT 04/26/06 03:11:53] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> yes
[GMT 04/26/06 03:11:54] <ICATS_DC8> I do NOT recall what I was doing when we did that
[GMT 04/26/06 03:12:06] <ICATS_DC8> can we try it next flight?
[GMT 04/26/06 03:12:32] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> sure, Larry just figured if you were bored we could try it.  No big deal.
[GMT 04/26/06 03:12:34] <GTRDC-DFRC> It was running on the DC-8, but I think it was not running on inbound
[GMT 04/26/06 03:12:44] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> That's true.
[GMT 04/26/06 03:14:28] <GTRDC-DFRC> Scott, ETA?
[GMT 04/26/06 03:16:10] <GTRDC-DFRC> Looks like they are getting ready to land soon
[GMT 04/26/06 03:16:24] <ICATS_DC8> 6 min to PT18 + about 50 to the coast + 20 in the pattern ---- I est. 1.5 hour
[GMT 04/26/06 03:16:59] <ICATS_DC8> leavel at 7.5k for 20 min
[GMT 04/26/06 03:17:19] <GTRDC-DFRC> Thanks
[GMT 04/26/06 03:18:59] <ICATS_DC8> R U sshed into REVEAL?
[GMT 04/26/06 03:19:08] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Scott, do you know how to disable individual modems on the 10 channel?
[GMT 04/26/06 03:19:12] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Carl, no
[GMT 04/26/06 03:19:19] <ICATS_DC8> nope
[GMT 04/26/06 03:19:21] <ICATS_DC8> well
[GMT 04/26/06 03:19:37] <ICATS_DC8> I could pull antenia
[GMT 04/26/06 03:19:44] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Nope
[GMT 04/26/06 03:20:38] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Okay, I'll show you tomorrow.  Larry wants us to be able to shutdown some of the modems to use less money and still be able to xchat and even get maps at a slower pace.
[GMT 04/26/06 03:23:17] <GTRDC-DFRC> Linux will make all much better (after lots of tweaking)
[GMT 04/26/06 03:23:28] <ICATS_DC8> BUT
[GMT 04/26/06 03:23:39] Last message repeated 2 time(s).
[GMT 04/26/06 03:23:39] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Scott, Carl, do either of you need the 10 channel up now?  If not let's turn it off and save a grand.
[GMT 04/26/06 03:23:43] <ICATS_DC8> We have a hard down day Wed
[GMT 04/26/06 03:24:02] <GTRDC-DFRC> happy landings!
[GMT 04/26/06 03:24:02] <ICATS_DC8> I can power her down
[GMT 04/26/06 03:24:07] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Okay, Thursday morning then before the flight, it only takes a couple of minutes.
[GMT 04/26/06 03:24:31] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> over and out.
