[GMT 04/24/06 18:59:34] <rafchem-SeaOps> Hi Bill, it's Teresa this time.  I'd like to remind you that on the last maintenance day we changed the TDL so that the two variables, TDLHI and TDLLO, send back constant voltages to let you know they are alive.
[GMT 04/24/06 19:00:47] <rafchem-SeaOps> Bill I, the two variables should read TDLHI=3-ish V and TDLLO=2.5V.  When you get a free minute, please confirm that the TDL is up and running.  Thx...

[GMT 04/24/06 22:15:08] <adsCockpit-c130> We have decided to come down to 2000 ft and fly north along the west curtain that we just did.  We will then go across the north and do the low leg of the east curtain until we run out of the pollutants and then will turn around and go back to land.  It should take us about an hour to do this.
