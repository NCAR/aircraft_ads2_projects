[GMT 04/17/06 17:44:02] <ICATS_DC8> Hello World

[GMT 04/17/06 17:47:18] <ICATS_DC8> It's power up and running
[GMT 04/17/06 17:47:22] <ICATS_DC8> I am using it now
[GMT 04/17/06 17:47:56] <ICATS_DC8> we got some sat. maps for Fuelberg before we took off
[GMT 04/17/06 17:51:23] <GTRDC-DFRC> so, the kvm/mouse snafu Scott mentioned in an email went away?
[GMT 04/17/06 17:51:51] <ICATS_DC8> no 
[GMT 04/17/06 17:52:02] <ICATS_DC8> it's that we have a patch 
[GMT 04/17/06 17:52:16] <ICATS_DC8> and the sorry ass patch is working fine
[GMT 04/17/06 17:52:23] <GTRDC-DFRC> please explain "patch"
[GMT 04/17/06 17:52:42] <ICATS_DC8> I did NOT want to pull a bunch of hardware on the morn of the flight
[GMT 04/17/06 17:52:49] <ICATS_DC8> We are using a USB mouse
[GMT 04/17/06 17:53:13] <ICATS_DC8> The kvm is working for all other computers
[GMT 04/17/06 17:53:25] <GTRDC-DFRC> what were you using before the USB mouse?  
[GMT 04/17/06 17:53:31] <ICATS_DC8> OH yae  I am Scott
[GMT 04/17/06 17:54:04] <ICATS_DC8> back to REAL ICATS stuff
[GMT 04/17/06 17:54:04] <ICATS_DC8> but first
[GMT 04/17/06 17:54:16] <ICATS_DC8> REVEAL is up and working
[GMT 04/17/06 17:54:34] <ICATS_DC8> I was using the mouse on the KVM switch
[GMT 04/17/06 17:55:41] <GTRDC-DFRC> Is everyone happy up there?
[GMT 04/17/06 17:55:53] <ICATS_DC8> with out the mouse I can NOT get the modems to call out
[GMT 04/17/06 17:55:53] <ICATS_DC8> without the mouse I can only boot the box
[GMT 04/17/06 17:56:38] <ICATS_DC8> yep!!  Henry got his pics and passed them out to all
[GMT 04/17/06 17:57:41] <GTRDC-DFRC> great... I will periodically check in with you on this xchat channel, OK?
[GMT 04/17/06 17:58:24] <ICATS_DC8> rodger
[GMT 04/17/06 18:03:38] <ICATS_DC8> What's your web site URL for REVEAL data
[GMT 04/17/06 18:06:32] <ICATS_DC8> They could use the URL on the &C130Q chat channel

[GMT 04/17/06 20:35:20] <GTRDC-DFRC> just checking in... everything ok?
[GMT 04/17/06 20:36:11] <ICATS_DC8> Working very well
[GMT 04/17/06 20:36:26] <ICATS_DC8> Had to reboot the 20 chanel once
[GMT 04/17/06 20:36:41] <ICATS_DC8> I am not sure if it was a NAT issue 
[GMT 04/17/06 20:36:46] <ICATS_DC8> or
[GMT 04/17/06 20:36:52] <ICATS_DC8> a NCAR IRC 
[GMT 04/17/06 20:36:57] <ICATS_DC8> or
[GMT 04/17/06 20:37:19] <ICATS_DC8> a 10 channel communication/handshaking thing
[GMT 04/17/06 20:37:37] <ICATS_DC8> It's times like this that I will have to agree with Carl
[GMT 04/17/06 20:38:11] <ICATS_DC8> It would be REALLLY nice if it was a dual boot box so that I could check soemthing out
[GMT 04/17/06 20:41:22] <ICATS_DC8> It would be nice if there were time stamps with these lines of text 
[GMT 04/17/06 20:41:24] <ICATS_DC8> or
[GMT 04/17/06 20:41:37] <ICATS_DC8> when folks jump in and/or out
[GMT 04/17/06 20:42:17] <GTRDC-DFRC> timestamps are an option under settings:preference:text box
[GMT 04/17/06 20:43:24] <ICATS_DC8> thanks
[GMT 04/17/06 20:44:14] <GTRDC-DFRC> gadgets for jumping around exist (beeps, etc), but I'm a newbie
[GMT 04/17/06 20:46:17] <ICATS_DC8> Well you should have been on line about19:45 when the C130Q channel was all a buzz with VP issues up in Washington
[GMT 04/17/06 20:46:57] <GTRDC-DFRC> ... my complaint is that my client crashes when left unattended, no clue why
[GMT 04/17/06 20:47:07] <ICATS_DC8> Airforce 2 finelly took of and I think they were still holding for the C17
[GMT 04/17/06 20:47:25] <ICATS_DC8> Yes they time out
[GMT 04/17/06 20:47:39] <ICATS_DC8> It broadcasts a ping timeout
[GMT 04/17/06 20:48:18] <ICATS_DC8> So I think what's happening is CO is kicking folks off that do NOT have a keep alive going
[GMT 04/17/06 20:48:39] <ICATS_DC8> Now to figure out how to keep them from knocking you off
[GMT 04/17/06 20:49:25] <ICATS_DC8> I you are also watching the C130Q room you will have noticed that
[GMT 04/17/06 20:49:41] <ICATS_DC8> some are leiving and some are ping timming out
[GMT 04/17/06 20:50:13] <GTRDC-DFRC> looks like C130 landed (google earth indication)
[GMT 04/17/06 20:51:41] <ICATS_DC8> Did you know that they do NOT know that REVEAL has a real time web site?
[GMT 04/17/06 20:52:28] <ICATS_DC8> The folks on the ground said they could tell where the C130 was with a Google earth page but they did NOT know where the DC8 was
[GMT 04/17/06 20:53:20] <ICATS_DC8> Yep at the rate they aew logiing off I would say that they are on the ground or have clearance to touch down
[GMT 04/17/06 20:54:05] <GTRDC-DFRC> ok, that's a communication problem we'll fix ASAP
[GMT 04/17/06 20:54:10] <ICATS_DC8> all the folks that are left in the C130Q room are on the  ground
[GMT 04/17/06 20:54:49] <ICATS_DC8> I have to go do some ICATS work\
[GMT 04/17/06 20:57:25] <ICATS_DC8> If I would have had the URL I would have spoken up in the Chat Room

[GMT 04/17/06 22:53:42] <GTRDC-DFRC> There is a KML file at http://analysis.creare.com/DC8/ (the link that says DC-8 Flight Track) that will allow the GoogleEarth user to watch DC-8
[GMT 04/17/06 22:53:56] <GTRDC-DFRC> I will send an email... anybody you want me to email directly?
[GMT 04/17/06 22:54:50] <ICATS_DC8> I see you are trying to figure out where I am
[GMT 04/17/06 22:55:50] <ICATS_DC8> Have Kathy send it to the folks on the C130 but then I really do NOT know is if any of the DC8 PIs know
[GMT 04/17/06 22:57:03] <GTRDC-DFRC> hmmm, the user ICATS_DC8 should be flying in a circle near -144 deg llongitude :)
