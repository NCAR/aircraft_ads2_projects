[GMT 05/13/06 00:01:54] <CarlS_Anchorage> Very good info, thanks
[GMT 05/13/06 00:03:20] <CarlS_Anchorage> I wonder if multilink PPP on linux would be faster, i.e. if the reason 10 isn't much better than 4 is because windows sucks
[GMT 05/13/06 00:05:10] <CarlS_Anchorage> or maybe it's something inherent in ML-PPP and the low baud rate per channel
[GMT 05/13/06 00:22:49] <ICATS_DC8> You ar easking the wrong guy
[GMT 05/13/06 00:28:58] <CarlS_Anchorage> A, you probably know just as much as I do
[GMT 05/13/06 00:29:42] <CarlS_Anchorage> We just had a lightning watch alert here at Kulis for the next hour
[GMT 05/13/06 00:32:01] <ICATS_DC8> So are you getting some REAL rain?
[GMT 05/13/06 00:32:44] <ICATS_DC8> Hanks new weather image is coming accross now!
[GMT 05/13/06 00:39:02] <CarlS_Anchorage> looks like some rain is coming, but pretty local, just a cell moving thru I guess
[GMT 05/13/06 00:41:48] <ICATS_DC8> So, we should NOT have any issues when we come in and land.
[GMT 05/13/06 00:44:23] <CarlS_Anchorage> far as I know, no worries mate
