[GMT 05/02/06 00:00:14] <adsCockpit-c130> Mike, pollution was at 20kft (O3>100, CO>300), but we were clearly in the bottom portion of things

[GMT 05/02/06 00:05:59] <JC_Zhou> Steve, Tony was here and talking to me and Yohei. Can you switch TSI and RR neph impactors when the scattering is high enough? We would like to see if there is any problem with RR neph impactor. 
[GMT 05/02/06 00:09:44] <Hawaii_C130> The only significant scattering we had was up high near the beginning.  Not much in excess of 10/Mm since then.  We have done that other times, particularly during the ground NaCl test.  Is there some indication of a problem?
[GMT 05/02/06 00:16:07] <Hawaii_C130> JC:  We just had a burst of large particle scattering starting at 18000 feet.  We're going to do a leg at 10000 feet.  If the scattering is still there I'll switch the RR impactor out and the TSI impactor in (not at the same time).  Scattering still isn't >10 though.

[GMT 05/02/06 00:55:00] <Hawaii_C130> JC:  It was inconclusive.  Now we're flying through alternating regions of very small particles/no scattering and high scattering (well, 7) with more RCN and HCN and CH2O

[GMT 05/02/06 00:57:56] <Hawaii_C130> JC:  I still have the RR neph on total mode and it agrees pretty well (just a bit below the TSI green.  Of course there are no large particles anyhow. 
[GMT 05/02/06 00:58:08] <dknapp_ops> does aeroseek use a flight plan or just extrapolate from last position?
[GMT 05/02/06 00:59:11] <Chris_Cantrell-Seattle__> It is using the flight plan and estimating landing based on location in that plan, I think.

[GMT 05/02/06 01:04:26] <Hawaii_C130> JC:  Scattering is up again, at about 20, but it changes a lot, so I'm not sure whether we would learn anything.  Again, the particles are small--the Angstrom coefficient is large.  We're actually seeing enough absorption that I can report an SSA.  At 0.8 it's suspiciously low, but it's te best absorption I've seen yet.
