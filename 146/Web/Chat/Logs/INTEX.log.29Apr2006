[GMT 04/29/06 00:23:17] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Hello all, if you're looking for the DC-8 flight for today we talk on &DC8.  But for now it is shutdown until they need something from us.  This is to save money.

[GMT 04/29/06 04:57:53] <Sky-ESCD> Hello Mark
[GMT 04/29/06 04:58:20] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Evening
[GMT 04/29/06 04:59:57] <Sky-ESCD> Are you just checking this out or watching the DC-8 flight that is in progress?
[GMT 04/29/06 05:03:04] <Sky-ESCD> If you don't know how to what the live flight, let me know and I'll tell you how.
[GMT 04/29/06 05:05:35] <Sky-ESCD> Are you still here Mark?

[GMT 04/29/06 05:16:05] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Sky-ESCD: I'm just checking in; I'm not directly involved in supporting INTEX, but I help support T-REX (which is just wrapping up) and the chat server itself
[GMT 04/29/06 05:16:59] <Sky-ESCD> Cool, we hope this server will stay alive to support INTEX to its conclusion of 15 May 2006.
[GMT 04/29/06 05:17:52] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Oh, definitely; we're supporting it long-term.
[GMT 04/29/06 05:24:52] <Sky-ESCD> Have you seen our live flight tracks yet for the DC-8 and C-130?
[GMT 04/29/06 05:24:58] <Sky-ESCD> If not would you like too?
[GMT 04/29/06 05:25:35] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Sure, where are they?
[GMT 04/29/06 05:27:18] <Sky-ESCD> First off you need Google Earth, downloadable from www.googleearth.com, simple install then I'll send you the two KML files that will show the DC-8 flying now, and the C-130 track from today's flight.
[GMT 04/29/06 05:27:47] <MarkBradford-Boulder> I have Google Earth, though it's a bit sluggish on my laptop
[GMT 04/29/06 05:28:48] <MarkBradford-Boulder> I've seen Chris Webster's Google Earth tracks for the Gulfstream, but not the C-130 or DC-8
[GMT 04/29/06 05:28:48] <Sky-ESCD> http://www.eol.ucar.edu/flight_data/mirage/RealTime.kml    This is the kml for the C-130 flight today, save to desktop and double click, it will open in Google earth and take you close to Seattle, zoom in.  I'll give you the DC-8 soon.
[GMT 04/29/06 05:30:17] <Sky-ESCD> http://analysis.creare.com/DC8    There are three links here, click and save to desktop and open in GE.  This is neat stuff.
[GMT 04/29/06 05:30:54] <Sky-ESCD> I would be very interested in Chris Webster's GE KML link.;
[GMT 04/29/06 05:32:43] <MarkBradford-Boulder> I'm afraid I don't happen to have it, but I'm pretty sure the C-130 KML is his work
[GMT 04/29/06 05:35:55] <Sky-ESCD> Well the link I gave you if you check it out right now and use the weather map of the pacific you can see the DC-8 is just past Kawaii and the skies are clear.
[GMT 04/29/06 05:38:43] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Very cool
[GMT 04/29/06 05:40:53] <Sky-ESCD> If you do the tilt of the earth you'll notice that there altitude profile is there.  Check out their flight profile of the spirals.  Same for the C-130.  It's grreat watching it live with the Meterology people and then Xchatting with the plane to say go some where else.
[GMT 04/29/06 05:43:15] <Sky-ESCD> Also, in GE go to 'tools' 'options' 'view' and turn off Atmosphere, it makes the image look much better.  Also if you system is slow,at the same place select small for 'Detail Area' that will speed up updates.
[GMT 04/29/06 05:44:00] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Thanks for the tips!  But it's getting pretty late here, so I think I'll play with that another time.
[GMT 04/29/06 05:45:00] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Good night!
