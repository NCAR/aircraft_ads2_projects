[GMT 03/22/06 03:47:58] <Saewung_dc8> Also another question Bob
[GMT 03/22/06 03:48:06] <Saewung_dc8> your nightflight mode
[GMT 03/22/06 03:48:43] <Saewung_dc8> I clicked it and just after one cycle it just turned off and changed as clean up mode
[GMT 03/22/06 03:48:43] <Saewung_dc8> is it what you programed?
[GMT 03/22/06 03:49:16] <rstickel_GT> it should run both cleanup and cal
[GMT 03/22/06 03:49:35] <Saewung_dc8> OK I will keep looking
[GMT 03/22/06 03:50:06] <rstickel_GT> NigthFlight is just a launcher for the other two - you should see a cal every 56 minutes
[GMT 03/22/06 03:50:37] <Saewung_dc8> But it supposed to be green during the flight right?
[GMT 03/22/06 03:51:22] <Saewung_dc8> Just after one background it changed as red..
[GMT 03/22/06 03:51:41] <GroundStation_DC8> Mike sez it's time to go, I'll find some dinnerand get back on later
[GMT 03/22/06 03:51:44] <Saewung_dc8> and I looked up your code.. it doesnt have go to 0 in the end of the code
[GMT 03/22/06 03:52:02] <rstickel_GT> the cal seq indicator should be green - the cal indicator is only green for 2 minutes every 56
[GMT 03/22/06 03:52:14] <rstickel_GT> l8r Carl
[GMT 03/22/06 03:52:42] <Saewung_dc8> Ok.. I'll keep looking!
[GMT 03/22/06 03:53:05] <Saewung_dc8> Hows atlanta? cold?
[GMT 03/22/06 03:53:12] <rstickel_GT> Saewung_dc8,  watch for the big spike
[GMT 03/22/06 03:53:25] <Saewung_dc8> NO?
[GMT 03/22/06 03:53:29] <rstickel_GT> it's nice here - low 60's

[GMT 03/22/06 05:09:18] <Saewung_dc8> Well no idea
[GMT 03/22/06 05:09:59] <SlamDog_N817> I got GRND CNTRL on the &ICATS so we R ok
[GMT 03/22/06 05:10:13] <Saewung_dc8> Agree
[GMT 03/22/06 05:10:26] <Saewung_dc8> Probably he is too sleepy right now
[GMT 03/22/06 05:10:38] <SlamDog_N817> Looking for some ZZZZZZZZs
[GMT 03/22/06 05:11:32] <Saewung_dc8> Yap
[GMT 03/22/06 05:11:56] <Saewung_dc8> Ill check the NO status
[GMT 03/22/06 05:12:57] <SlamDog_N817> I'm chatting with Carl on the &ICATS channel

[GMT 03/22/06 05:14:28] <SlamDog_N817> What, you needed another beverage?
[GMT 03/22/06 05:14:28] Nick change: rstickel -> rstickel_GT
[GMT 03/22/06 05:17:02] <Saewung_dc8> Bob you chatched all I've said to you?
[GMT 03/22/06 05:17:57] <rstickel_GT> Saewung_dc8, sorry, no - nothing after air is higher than ZA
[GMT 03/22/06 05:18:22] <Saewung_dc8> Ok just after I changed to outside air
[GMT 03/22/06 05:19:41] <Saewung_dc8> it looks the differnce from bkg had been getting bigger
[GMT 03/22/06 05:19:41] <Saewung_dc8> now around 1000cnts
[GMT 03/22/06 05:20:16] <rstickel_GT> Saewung_dc8, ouch

[GMT 03/22/06 08:51:59] <SlamDog_N817> WHy R U NOT in &ICTAS
[GMT 03/22/06 08:52:58] <SlamDog_N817> Hello World
[GMT 03/22/06 08:53:09] <SlamDog_N817> Yes we are over Utah
[GMT 03/22/06 08:54:04] <SlamDog_N817> I was typeing in the &ICATS channel
[GMT 03/22/06 08:54:45] <SlamDog_N817> Yes a lot of folks R sleeping
[GMT 03/22/06 08:54:57] <GroundStation_DC8> I was off line for awhile , my wireless connection was real poor
[GMT 03/22/06 08:55:21] <SlamDog_N817> I think the 10 channel drops out after traveling some X miles
[GMT 03/22/06 08:55:36] <SlamDog_N817> I had 2 redial
[GMT 03/22/06 08:55:44] <SlamDog_N817> I did NOT reboot
[GMT 03/22/06 08:56:37] <SlamDog_N817> I think the PPP dialer is better because I do not think the OS hangs as badly when I have to redial
[GMT 03/22/06 08:56:37] <GroundStation_DC8> Cool. It could be miles instead of time, since the satellites are moving and have a footprint
[GMT 03/22/06 08:57:22] <SlamDog_N817> Can I go back to sleep now?
[GMT 03/22/06 08:57:36] <GroundStation_DC8> I get the feeling the winky blinky GUI just add a layer of cr*p that the OS has to deal with 
[GMT 03/22/06 08:57:49] <SlamDog_N817> You better type a lot so I do NOT fall asleep while I/m typeing
[GMT 03/22/06 08:58:13] <GroundStation_DC8> qwertyasdfgzxcvb
[GMT 03/22/06 08:58:20] <SlamDog_N817> A REAL OS can handle "crap"y code
[GMT 03/22/06 08:58:56] <SlamDog_N817> looks like REVEAL is happy
[GMT 03/22/06 08:59:08] <GroundStation_DC8> real Os's don't need reboots
[GMT 03/22/06 09:00:33] <GroundStation_DC8> Speaking of reboots, I'm glad it did not hang (although that's not unusual, and it only used to happen at boot time before we upgraded to 1GHz CPU and later rev Linux
[GMT 03/22/06 09:01:46] <GroundStation_DC8> I think there are signal integrity margins that are less with the higher speed and even less with increased temp, or maybe a bug in the OS that gets expressed by losing a race with the above timing issue.
[GMT 03/22/06 09:02:15] <GroundStation_DC8> But the hang this morning is maybe a counter-example, it was not that warm I think.
