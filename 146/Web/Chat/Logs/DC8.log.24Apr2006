[GMT 04/24/06 01:27:50] <ICATS_DC8> hello world
[GMT 04/24/06 01:28:19] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Howdy
[GMT 04/24/06 01:28:44] <ICATS_DC8> so where is DJJ?
[GMT 04/24/06 01:28:50] <ICATS_DC8> OR
[GMT 04/24/06 01:29:07] <ICATS_DC8> What email address would he like us to use?
[GMT 04/24/06 01:29:17] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> DJJ where abouts at this time unknown, Kathy at beach
[GMT 04/24/06 01:29:40] <ICATS_DC8> That works real well
[GMT 04/24/06 01:29:51] <ICATS_DC8> I had a mouse issue wth the 10 channel
[GMT 04/24/06 01:29:55] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> I will go look for him again, oh here he is and he just e-mailed you back
[GMT 04/24/06 01:29:57] <ICATS_DC8> I had to reboot
[GMT 04/24/06 01:30:21] <ICATS_DC8> I'm using the company mouse right now
[GMT 04/24/06 01:30:26] <ICATS_DC8> OK
[GMT 04/24/06 01:30:30] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Yea, yea, I'll work some more on the mouse issue
[GMT 04/24/06 01:30:36] <ICATS_DC8> I'll go read my emai
[GMT 04/24/06 01:31:19] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Okay, now for the way points thing.  Here's what you try --
[GMT 04/24/06 01:31:48] <ICATS_DC8> I got the email :-)
[GMT 04/24/06 01:31:55] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Go to the IOI program and tell it to display the way points and see if there is anything there, step one
[GMT 04/24/06 01:32:13] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Let me know if there IS or Isn't way points there
[GMT 04/24/06 01:32:43] <ICATS_DC8> Ask that clown to try sending us pdf files
[GMT 04/24/06 01:33:23] <ICATS_DC8> THERE ARE no wypt in the display  from the tip hardwire software
[GMT 04/24/06 01:34:43] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> On it's way, and you call him a clown, not me.
[GMT 04/24/06 01:35:18] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> I know there aren't any in the "Tip Hardwire" I said go to Mei's IOI program and pull up the way points
[GMT 04/24/06 01:36:13] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> You can look at the way points in the IOI program
[GMT 04/24/06 01:36:38] <ICATS_DC8> I'm working the  *.ppt with HBS
[GMT 04/24/06 01:37:25] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> DJJ is creating a pdf and resending
[GMT 04/24/06 01:40:49] <ICATS_DC8> the Mei IOI program?
[GMT 04/24/06 01:40:57] <ICATS_DC8> I do NOT understand
[GMT 04/24/06 01:41:07] <ICATS_DC8> what do I type?
[GMT 04/24/06 01:42:09] <ICATS_DC8> OH 
[GMT 04/24/06 01:42:49] <ICATS_DC8> I think you are talking about the OTHER way to long in wypts
[GMT 04/24/06 01:43:01] <ICATS_DC8> The one in the runnewioi code
[GMT 04/24/06 01:43:25] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> That's called "run" "new" "ioi" that
[GMT 04/24/06 01:43:27] <ICATS_DC8> I can launch a GUI that will alow me to re-login wypts
[GMT 04/24/06 01:43:33] <ICATS_DC8> I have never used it
[GMT 04/24/06 01:43:37] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Don't do that
[GMT 04/24/06 01:43:39] <ICATS_DC8> Is it safe?
[GMT 04/24/06 01:44:16] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> There is a gui there in the top left of the IOI program gui that will let you yes enter way points, but also view them
[GMT 04/24/06 01:44:21] <ICATS_DC8> still pulling the *.ppt file over
[GMT 04/24/06 01:44:34] <ICATS_DC8> ok 
[GMT 04/24/06 01:44:44] <ICATS_DC8> I will see what I can VIEW
[GMT 04/24/06 01:44:48] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> I want you to use the part that will 'display' the way points and see if there are any there'
[GMT 04/24/06 01:45:33] <ICATS_DC8> YES
[GMT 04/24/06 01:45:47] <ICATS_DC8> there is a button 
[GMT 04/24/06 01:45:57] <ICATS_DC8> just a little off center
[GMT 04/24/06 01:46:04] <ICATS_DC8> to the uper left
[GMT 04/24/06 01:46:16] <ICATS_DC8> I can push that button
[GMT 04/24/06 01:46:28] <ICATS_DC8> it throughs a GUI at me
[GMT 04/24/06 01:46:30] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Then see what it shows you, it's safe
[GMT 04/24/06 01:46:31] <ICATS_DC8> it's empty
[GMT 04/24/06 01:46:42] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Not good
[GMT 04/24/06 01:47:16] <ICATS_DC8> I did it again
[GMT 04/24/06 01:47:25] <ICATS_DC8> I get better results
[GMT 04/24/06 01:47:35] <ICATS_DC8> I have real info this time
[GMT 04/24/06 01:47:46] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> So you now have way points?
[GMT 04/24/06 01:48:13] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Go do Tip Hardwire, RW RW again
[GMT 04/24/06 01:48:14] <ICATS_DC8> yes and no
[GMT 04/24/06 01:48:32] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> What is yes and no mean
[GMT 04/24/06 01:48:39] <ICATS_DC8> I can NOT get the wypts to update on the TV display
[GMT 04/24/06 01:48:49] <ICATS_DC8> I can not step through them in tip hardwire
[GMT 04/24/06 01:48:58] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> I know this
[GMT 04/24/06 01:49:00] <ICATS_DC8> I can NOT display them in tiphardwire
[GMT 04/24/06 01:49:13] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> I'm only trying to look at the IOI program right now
[GMT 04/24/06 01:49:23] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Don't get a head of me
[GMT 04/24/06 01:49:47] <ICATS_DC8> tip hardwire is always empty
[GMT 04/24/06 01:50:17] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Yes it has been, I understand, we need to get them displayed in IOI first, then we'll worry about the VME

[GMT 04/24/06 01:51:31] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> VME = "tip hardwire"
[GMT 04/24/06 01:51:37] <ICATS_DC8> I'm back
[GMT 04/24/06 01:51:45] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> IOI = the gui from "runnewioi"
[GMT 04/24/06 01:51:58] <ICATS_DC8> yes I got that VME is the smae as tip hardwire
[GMT 04/24/06 01:52:33] <ICATS_DC8> OK I get my wypt data in the extra runnewioi GUI
[GMT 04/24/06 01:52:38] <ICATS_DC8> What can one do with it?
[GMT 04/24/06 01:52:51] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Is it correct?
[GMT 04/24/06 01:53:09] <ICATS_DC8> It sure looks good to me
[GMT 04/24/06 01:53:22] <ICATS_DC8> It looks like the data that I was given yesterday
[GMT 04/24/06 01:54:01] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> You don't see any mistakes like comas for periods, extra spaces or such?
[GMT 04/24/06 01:54:21] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> You don't have any six (6) character way point names?
[GMT 04/24/06 01:55:02] <ICATS_DC8> it look clean
[GMT 04/24/06 01:55:49] <ICATS_DC8> I have 3 wypts with 5 characters NONE with more than 5
[GMT 04/24/06 01:56:02] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> 5 or less is good
[GMT 04/24/06 01:56:17] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> How's the track plot look?
[GMT 04/24/06 01:56:54] <ICATS_DC8> all "+" for lat and all are "-" for long
[GMT 04/24/06 01:57:07] <ICATS_DC8> track plots been working GREAT!!!
[GMT 04/24/06 01:57:14] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> ok good
[GMT 04/24/06 01:58:01] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> I have seen this before and am racking my two brain cells to give you a good safe fix for it
[GMT 04/24/06 01:58:16] <ICATS_DC8> I really thinks it's fallout from the battery and writeing all the files
[GMT 04/24/06 01:58:27] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> It is a corupted way point file
[GMT 04/24/06 01:58:28] <ICATS_DC8> something is not kewl in the ffs
[GMT 04/24/06 01:59:42] <ICATS_DC8> I recall that sorrrry wypt files also hosed the track plots
[GMT 04/24/06 01:59:50] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> When you go and try to look at the way points in the VME and you don't see them, look at the left and see if there is a scroll bar and if so scroll down.
[GMT 04/24/06 02:00:12] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Can, but depends upon the error.
[GMT 04/24/06 02:00:38] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Look at the other left, I meant the right side where the scroll bar would normally be.
[GMT 04/24/06 02:01:25] <ICATS_DC8> no scroll bar
[GMT 04/24/06 02:01:31] <ICATS_DC8> no errors in the log files
[GMT 04/24/06 02:01:31] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> ok good
[GMT 04/24/06 02:02:25] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> you didn't happen to corrupt the wypt.sav file name did you?
[GMT 04/24/06 02:02:43] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> or the wypt.asc
[GMT 04/24/06 02:03:06] <ICATS_DC8> I'll take a look 
[GMT 04/24/06 02:03:33] <ICATS_DC8> but  if they are hosed the track plot would NOT work
[GMT 04/24/06 02:03:55] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> not true, you tell the track plot program what file to read
[GMT 04/24/06 02:04:26] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> yea you're talking about the tp program, that is true
[GMT 04/24/06 02:05:50] <ICATS_DC8> i keep changing the wypt.asc file as per flight track
[GMT 04/24/06 02:06:07] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> I agree, if IOI is working ok and the track plot is good and you're able to make new .asc files for the track plot then all that should be good
[GMT 04/24/06 02:07:22] <ICATS_DC8> That's the way it all worked before I replaced the batteries and did a write files to ffs
[GMT 04/24/06 02:07:53] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> please take a look at the wypt.sav file and see what it looks like, I know that is what is opened when you start fp, but fp is more forgiving than the VME
[GMT 04/24/06 02:08:37] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> In fact if your way points are all in order in the fp gui, then save and make a new wypt.sav file.
[GMT 04/24/06 02:08:41] <ICATS_DC8> I have a runreadwypts script
[GMT 04/24/06 02:09:16] <ICATS_DC8> and I was running it prior to Iridium
[GMT 04/24/06 02:09:28] <ICATS_DC8> I tell you the two files LOOK great
[GMT 04/24/06 02:09:46] <ICATS_DC8> could it be a permisions thing?
[GMT 04/24/06 02:10:02] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> I understand.  You told me you just made this runreadwypts script.  Have you used it before this flight?
[GMT 04/24/06 02:10:41] <ICATS_DC8> OK I'll try the make wypt.sav again
[GMT 04/24/06 02:10:43] <ICATS_DC8> I have used it since we got to TexAss
[GMT 04/24/06 02:11:01] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Ok.
[GMT 04/24/06 02:11:21] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> As for permissions, the file just needs to be readable by everything
[GMT 04/24/06 02:11:45] <ICATS_DC8> I have NOT figured out who to re-write the *.sav file yet
[GMT 04/24/06 02:11:45] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> I know it has to be writable by the owner so it can be updated.
[GMT 04/24/06 02:12:50] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Make any kind of change to the way points in the fp gui, like copy one way point, paste it at the end and then delete it.  It will then know a change was made and will allow you to save it again
[GMT 04/24/06 02:14:51] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> I have to step out for a couple of minutes.  I'll be back.
[GMT 04/24/06 02:14:55] <ICATS_DC8> Yep that worked, I can mod the files and I can make a wypt.sav file
[GMT 04/24/06 02:15:00] <ICATS_DC8> BUT
[GMT 04/24/06 02:15:09] <ICATS_DC8> that does NOT help the VME out  :-(
[GMT 04/24/06 02:19:49] <ICATS_DC8> I'lll be doing a map for FSU
[GMT 04/24/06 02:28:00] <ICATS_DC8> Ok I gotten Hank taken care of
[GMT 04/24/06 02:29:12] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> DJJ is here wanting to know did you get the pdf?
[GMT 04/24/06 02:29:36] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Ok on the wypt and no good for VME.
[GMT 04/24/06 02:29:55] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> One last avenue to try then done with troubleshooting this today,
[GMT 04/24/06 02:30:58] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> In tip hardwire, go to the page where you read the way points and tell it to read 3 - 5 times in a row some times this works too.
[GMT 04/24/06 02:48:15] <ICATS_DC8> Tell DJJ - printed two copies
[GMT 04/24/06 02:48:30] <ICATS_DC8> RH got it .... read your email
[GMT 04/24/06 02:48:33] <ICATS_DC8> nfsmounticats1
[GMT 04/24/06 02:48:49] <ICATS_DC8> It's working
[GMT 04/24/06 02:52:25] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Yea, well it didn't occur to me about whether it was mounted or not, that bit me before and I still didn't think of it.
[GMT 04/24/06 02:53:12] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> I know why now, I was in your way and you didn't reboot the VME after turning on the Sun machine.  Happens every time.
[GMT 04/24/06 02:53:59] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> That's how I avoided that problem, when I ran you through the process of turning things on, I know I said to be sure to reboot the VME after turning on the Sun.
[GMT 04/24/06 03:13:11] <ICATS_DC8> printer issues
[GMT 04/24/06 03:13:30] <ICATS_DC8> What's a "switch error"?  
[GMT 04/24/06 03:13:44] <ICATS_DC8> Well at least that's what I think it says.
[GMT 04/24/06 03:13:56] <ICATS_DC8> Had a paper jam under the fuser bar
[GMT 04/24/06 03:14:08] <ICATS_DC8> also jammed up in the paper feed
[GMT 04/24/06 03:14:10] <ICATS_DC8> and
[GMT 04/24/06 03:14:18] <ICATS_DC8> under the black ink
[GMT 04/24/06 03:21:38] <ICATS_DC8> it's a 981 service issue
[GMT 04/24/06 03:27:54] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> What's a 981?
[GMT 04/24/06 03:31:33] <ICATS_DC8> An error code
[GMT 04/24/06 03:32:00] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> According to the web, NOT GOOD!
[GMT 04/24/06 03:32:24] <ICATS_DC8> Are you working th eoverhead projector?
[GMT 04/24/06 03:32:34] <ICATS_DC8> We are droping soem waypts
[GMT 04/24/06 03:32:49] <ICATS_DC8> we are about to reach 14
[GMT 04/24/06 03:32:52] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> First thing to do is power it off, remove all the print cartridges, ensure all looks okay and then reset everything and turn back on and hope you don't get the 981 again.
[GMT 04/24/06 03:33:00] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Yes we are on projector
[GMT 04/24/06 03:33:10] <ICATS_DC8> we are looking at not using PT15 & Pt16
[GMT 04/24/06 03:33:48] <ICATS_DC8> I'm off to the printer
[GMT 04/24/06 03:48:01] <ICATS_DC8> It's off for the rest of the flight
[GMT 04/24/06 03:48:54] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> If that didn't fix it then you might be out of a printer.  According to the web if resetting doesn't fix it, it is a broken belt or the pully with it.
[GMT 04/24/06 03:52:00] <ICATS_DC8> Make My Day!
[GMT 04/24/06 03:52:12] <ICATS_DC8> Is Rick Shetter around?

[GMT 04/24/06 03:52:28] <ICATS_DC8> If you see him you might put him in the loop
[GMT 04/24/06 03:52:39] <ICATS_DC8> I'll drop him an email
[GMT 04/24/06 03:52:39] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Ok.
