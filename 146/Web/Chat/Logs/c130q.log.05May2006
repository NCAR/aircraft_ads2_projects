[GMT 05/05/06 17:26:22] <TeresaCampos-bldr> Did Cliff/Andy run CO during the pre-flight?
[GMT 05/05/06 17:27:13] <adsCockpit-c130> Yes, CO was running before the flight
[GMT 05/05/06 17:27:59] <TeresaCampos-bldr> With no APU, Cliff/Andy may have switched off the lamp for the power transfer to protect it.  Is this what happened?
[GMT 05/05/06 17:29:25] <adsCockpit-c130> I'm not sure what they did on the power transition  Andyis headed back to the hotel  Pavel did cycle both the power and the lamp swirch before we took off

[GMT 05/05/06 17:31:30] <TeresaCampos-bldr> Ok.  When we have to cycle power on the lamp switch, the lamp usually takes longer to re-light.  I'll call Cliff and confirm that he plans to work with one of the crew to make sure CO comes up ASAP.

[GMT 05/05/06 19:04:10] <DMT-C130> (McCabe) Hi Sam.  IRIG is currently pulled, pls confirm that I should keep it that way!
[GMT 05/05/06 19:04:35] <DMT-C130> (McC) Hour is correct on both systems.
[GMT 05/05/06 19:05:36] <Hawaii_C130> Jason:  We just finished a climb so once again things are a bit messy.  So far it looks okay.  Diameters are correct.  RH down output was about 77% during the ascent but is now 83%.
[GMT 05/05/06 19:05:49] <DMT-C130> (McC) Ok, guess that was implicit.  If restart is need I will plug in IRIG first.
[GMT 05/05/06 19:06:12] <JasonTomlinson-OpCntr> sounds good ...thanks steve

[GMT 05/05/06 19:13:34] <Sam_Hall> David, yes, please leave it unplugged.  Only plug back in if hours are off.  Thanks!

[GMT 05/05/06 20:33:52] <FrankFlocke-Boulder> Q for Kip - how did you get the engines started w/o APU???
[GMT 05/05/06 20:34:22] <FrankFlocke-Boulder> external equipment?
[GMT 05/05/06 20:34:27] <NOxyO3_C130> PAN is working ok so far, only adjust the resolution setting once. But the resolution changes during the power switch, that might point to the ground problem in the RF detector of Extrel unit
[GMT 05/05/06 20:34:50] <pavel-334_> Yes, external compressed air tank.
[GMT 05/05/06 20:35:18] <NOxyO3_C130> Hi, Frank

[GMT 05/05/06 22:54:48] <DataSystem-c130> Hi Louisa, Jim here...We saw a very thin layer (<1000ft) on the way out at 10kft (CO>200).  Above and below, CO was less than 150.
[GMT 05/05/06 22:55:20] <DataSystem-c130> The layer was seen twice, but was too thin to stay in horizontally.
[GMT 05/05/06 22:56:14] <DataSystem-c130> On the far end we saw another layer on top of the BL inversion.  CO between 150-200, but again too thin to sample horizontally, so we pass up abd down throughit several times.
[GMT 05/05/06 22:56:46] <DataSystem-c130> Bottom lineis we are finding something, but it is much more stratified than what we expected.  Other plumes on other flights were quitea bit thicker
[GMT 05/05/06 22:57:30] <DataSystem-c130> Air at altitude here is very clean (CO ~100, also high O3 and NOy)
