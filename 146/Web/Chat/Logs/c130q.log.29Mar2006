[GMT 03/29/06 18:31:14] <DannyOpsRm3> At the bottom of the profile many tracers showed greater variability in the boundary layer
[GMT 03/29/06 18:31:26] <knapp_veracruz> i see high variability in all NOxy mid of 63800 is that what you mean?
[GMT 03/29/06 18:31:40] <DannyOpsRm3> If that was the source of the noise it may be that it is real variability.

[GMT 03/29/06 20:36:32] <DataSystem-c130> Hi  Pavel,  JStill having problems with right wing dsm.  Itslowly loses its time sync with the other  dsms
[GMT 03/29/06 20:37:49] <pavel-jeffco> Looks more like a question to Chris... Chris? Any thoughts?
[GMT 03/29/06 20:38:20] <DataSystem-c130> It worked fine before the flight.  Problem started about the time we closed the doors.  Might ask larry if he has any ideas
[GMT 03/29/06 20:39:03] <AlSchanot-ops> Hi Greg:  We're finally back from the airport
[GMT 03/29/06 20:39:08] <DataSystem-c130> I've recycled power on it about four times at different stages of the flight.  We are pretty much running without it.
[GMT 03/29/06 20:39:51] <AlSchanot-ops> Can I assume that the rgt pod dsm is off line again?
[GMT 03/29/06 20:40:09] <DataSystem-c130> Hi Al, just to let you know we have turned off the right dsm.  
[GMT 03/29/06 20:40:24] <pavel-jeffco> Greg, Larry is on the phone, he'll get back to me in a sec.
[GMT 03/29/06 20:40:27] <AlSchanot-ops> I got the message that it is running behind on time, but are you getting data?
[GMT 03/29/06 20:40:54] <DataSystem-c130> Itloses its time sync in about ten minutes.  Began about the time we closed the doors
[GMT 03/29/06 20:41:23] <AlSchanot-ops> OK.  So you turned it off to prevent loss of data from other sources?
[GMT 03/29/06 20:41:40] <DataSystem-c130> yes we are taking data
[GMT 03/29/06 20:42:02] <DataSystem-c130> We decided to turn it off so it did not hang up the other ones

[GMT 03/29/06 20:54:16] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> DataSystem-c130  maybe you've lost the 1PPS to that dsm....
[GMT 03/29/06 20:54:16] <adsCockpit-c130> our original profile location is in the clouds now
[GMT 03/29/06 20:54:35] <adsCockpit-c130> we cannot profile there again
[GMT 03/29/06 20:55:08] <AlSchanot-ops> Greg:  did you try cycling power to the rgt pod PMS probes?
[GMT 03/29/06 20:55:32] <DannyOpsRm3> Frank cloud in PRF15 area is widespread will check radars
[GMT 03/29/06 20:56:04] <adsCockpit-c130> we will move the profile to the S about 10 miles to the SW
[GMT 03/29/06 20:56:04] <adsCockpit-c130> I suspect however when  we return at 2245 here we will have a lot of bad weather here
[GMT 03/29/06 20:56:55] <adsCockpit-c130> I think it will be likely that we cannot return here later today

[GMT 03/29/06 20:57:34] <pavel-jeffco> Al - thanks, I understand. Is Kerry going to ship user equipment from Jeffco to Seattle?
[GMT 03/29/06 20:58:04] <DataSystem-c130> Yes I've tried it adout or 5 times with pretty much the same result each time
[GMT 03/29/06 20:59:00] <AlSchanot-ops> OK Greg.  Good work.  Let it go until we get back to JeffCO
[GMT 03/29/06 20:59:01] <DataSystem-c130> It will connect and then slowly lose its time sync with the others in 10 to 15 minutes
[GMT 03/29/06 20:59:41] <pavel-jeffco> Larry talekd with Mike Spowart, and concluded that right wing dsm isn't getting the 1 sps pulse for time sync. Either the time card in the dsm or the connection to it.
[GMT 03/29/06 21:00:32] <DataSystem-c130> Ok, its very strange that it worked fine on the ground
[GMT 03/29/06 21:00:32] <DataSystem-c130> Thanks Pavel
[GMT 03/29/06 21:02:26] <pavel-jeffco> Greg, Larry says it could be the signal cable that comes out of the aft dsm. It is a split signal that goes out of the back dsm, Larry is not sure you can get to the splitter in flight.
[GMT 03/29/06 21:02:39] <jcowan-hotel> That is strange that it worked on the ground. I can only guess that maybe I did not get a connection tight on the DSM since we did have the timing card out today for cleaning.
[GMT 03/29/06 21:03:02] <DataSystem-c130> I will take a look
[GMT 03/29/06 21:03:08] <DannyOpsRm3> Frank there appear to be a less cloudy area 18:55' and 97:50'
[GMT 03/29/06 21:04:58] <DataSystem-c130> Found the pps coming out of the aft dsm and they all appear to be connected
[GMT 03/29/06 21:05:10] <adsCockpit-c130> Yes that is 40 miles S of here.
[GMT 03/29/06 21:05:25] <adsCockpit-c130> we will have to play it by ear when we get back here
[GMT 03/29/06 21:05:39] <adsCockpit-c130> The convection here is already pretty impressive
[GMT 03/29/06 21:06:26] <pavel-jeffco> Greg - Well, it was worth a try. If the main connector was off all dsms would drift. Must be the wing dsm itself.
[GMT 03/29/06 21:06:28] <adsCockpit-c130> if there is weather developing here we will have to go way further S and may get out of polluted area
[GMT 03/29/06 21:07:15] <DataSystem-c130> Ok thanks for the help

[GMT 03/29/06 21:26:28] <DannyOpsRm3> Frank for the best prospect for the last B200-C130 joint profile looks like it is out over the water where you are now heading.
[GMT 03/29/06 21:27:16] <DannyOpsRm3> it looks like 19N 95W and no minutes would give you a good chance of a profile down through old pollution 
[GMT 03/29/06 21:29:57] <adsCockpit-c130> can do that if the B-200 is OK with it
[GMT 03/29/06 21:30:39] <adsCockpit-c130> I have the stuff a little closer more like 19 and 95:30
[GMT 03/29/06 21:31:42] <DannyOpsRm3> B200 could reach that point by 2352
[GMT 03/29/06 21:32:22] <DannyOpsRm3> Your point would also work and would save the B200 a little time so could get there a little earlier
[GMT 03/29/06 21:32:26] <adsCockpit-c130> 2352????
[GMT 03/29/06 21:32:42] <DannyOpsRm3> We would be relying on you relaying this to the B200
[GMT 03/29/06 21:32:45] <adsCockpit-c130> we'll have to play hard out here for 2.5 hours....

[GMT 03/29/06 22:04:34] <adsCockpit-c130> we will do them last thing if we have to but there should be time between this return run and the profile
[GMT 03/29/06 22:05:15] <AlSchanot-ops> If not over water, make sure you are well above the PBL
[GMT 03/29/06 22:07:30] <adsCockpit-c130> will do - no turbulence
[GMT 03/29/06 22:07:30] <adsCockpit-c130> got apreferred altitude??

[GMT 03/29/06 22:08:46] <AlSchanot-ops> how high is the terrain in the target area?  if done at 17K ft, then terrain mostly irrelevant
[GMT 03/29/06 22:09:48] <adsCockpit-c130> we can do it over wather just NE of VER

[GMT 03/29/06 22:10:13] <AlSchanot-ops> if over water - which is preferable - do them at 10K ft
[GMT 03/29/06 22:10:31] <adsCockpit-c130> 10000 - 12000 feet?
[GMT 03/29/06 22:10:38] <AlSchanot-ops> OK

[GMT 03/29/06 22:11:28] <DannyOpsRm3> Frank can you keep trying to contact the B200. 
[GMT 03/29/06 22:11:41] <DannyOpsRm3> They do not know about the change of plan
[GMT 03/29/06 22:11:57] <DannyOpsRm3> will need you to relay message from Chris H
[GMT 03/29/06 22:12:53] <adsCockpit-c130> roger 10k
[GMT 03/29/06 22:12:53] <adsCockpit-c130> have not tried yet but will
[GMT 03/29/06 22:13:00] <adsCockpit-c130> have only one brain - which is slowing down a bit also....
[GMT 03/29/06 22:13:00] <adsCockpit-c130> OK go ahead
[GMT 03/29/06 22:13:29] <DannyOpsRm3> One brain is better than none :-)
[GMT 03/29/06 22:13:47] <adsCockpit-c130> will tell them we will profile at 18:45 and 98:15 starting at 2300 or thereabouts and see what their ETA is
[GMT 03/29/06 22:15:06] <adsCockpit-c130> if later we'll wait a little bit
[GMT 03/29/06 22:15:06] <adsCockpit-c130> OK?
[GMT 03/29/06 22:16:39] <adsCockpit-c130> true
[GMT 03/29/06 22:17:02] <adsCockpit-c130> will break for Schanot maneuvers in 2 min
[GMT 03/29/06 22:17:14] <DannyOpsRm3> This is John Hair: That sounds good.  We really do not know their status at this time on their schedule.
[GMT 03/29/06 22:17:30] <adsCockpit-c130> will also cal NOy then
[GMT 03/29/06 22:18:27] <davidk_veracruz> by 22 min i mean the "no-cal" switch has to stay "off" for > 22 min at a time to get  a full cycle, does that make sense?
[GMT 03/29/06 22:21:58] <adsCockpit-c130> yes we know about the cycle
[GMT 03/29/06 22:22:19] <davidk_veracruz> ok
[GMT 03/29/06 22:24:35] <adsCockpit-c130> no luck reaching B-200 on the radio so far
[GMT 03/29/06 22:27:29] <adsCockpit-c130> just contacted B-200 they know about the new profile location and will join us there at ~2300
[GMT 03/29/06 22:27:40] <adsCockpit-c130> starting maneuvers now
[GMT 03/29/06 22:27:49] <adsCockpit-c130> at 10500 feet
[GMT 03/29/06 22:28:27] <adsCockpit-c130> noy cal started
[GMT 03/29/06 22:34:19] <DannyOpsRm3> Frank please relay this short novel from Chris H to the B200 crew.
[GMT 03/29/06 22:34:36] <DannyOpsRm3> Request B200 route to spiral point
[GMT 03/29/06 22:35:38] <DannyOpsRm3> go along 18:45' latitude if this still allows them to match agreed C-130 overpass time
[GMT 03/29/06 22:36:05] <DannyOpsRm3> Also, let them know that south MC gap is cloud free.
[GMT 03/29/06 22:37:19] <DannyOpsRm3> Sat down link appears locked since 22:15
[GMT 03/29/06 22:37:33] <davidk_veracruz> just noticed that myself
[GMT 03/29/06 22:41:53] <AlSchanot-ops> We've got you pegged for a 1800 CST ETA.  is this about right or will work with B200 extend the time?
[GMT 03/29/06 22:42:29] <davidk_veracruz> i think the  link dropped out a while ago Allen
[GMT 03/29/06 22:42:52] <AlSchanot-ops> they are still up on chat
[GMT 03/29/06 22:43:10] <AlSchanot-ops> I've got current ION data

[GMT 03/29/06 22:43:41] <adsCockpit-c130> B-200 will meet with us at profile location in 20 min
[GMT 03/29/06 22:44:01] <adsCockpit-c130> then we will do profile and go straight to VER
[GMT 03/29/06 22:44:01] <adsCockpit-c130> would estimate no later than  23:40
[GMT 03/29/06 22:44:17] <AlSchanot-ops> OK thanks
[GMT 03/29/06 22:44:22] <adsCockpit-c130> maybe 23:30
[GMT 03/29/06 22:44:43] <adsCockpit-c130> profile is only 12 miles from VER
[GMT 03/29/06 22:46:07] <DannyOpsRm3> Then the problem may lie elsewhere the Goole Earth doe snot update nor the display dataset I have been downloading
[GMT 03/29/06 22:46:22] <davidk_veracruz> that's what i'm noticing i guess
