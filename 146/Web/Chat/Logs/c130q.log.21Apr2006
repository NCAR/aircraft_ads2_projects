[GMT 04/21/06 17:30:25] <adsCockpit-c130> Hi Wengang - yes the resolution drifted. I had to adjust and then after T/O it got warm and I had to adjust back a little. We might have to fly from now on...
[GMT 04/21/06 17:30:53] <adsCockpit-c130> I cannot use this terminal a lot. Will try in the back...

[GMT 04/21/06 17:33:28] <wengangZh-Boulder> Hi
[GMT 04/21/06 17:33:45] <wengangZh-Boulder> Just hope it will stay at this setting for the cabin temperature
[GMT 04/21/06 17:34:31] <ams_c130> It is getting colder again in the back now. I had the peaks pretty fat when it was warm so maybe this will work. I'll run many spectra and we can look at the resolution versus temp in the silver box
[GMT 04/21/06 17:35:13] <knapp_ops> frank, if you get a chance can you verify noxyo3 counts look good?
[GMT 04/21/06 17:35:32] <ams_c130> I'll give you another update later.
[GMT 04/21/06 17:36:28] <wengangZh-Boulder> That should be a good indication, that temperature might be very close to the "blue box" I think
[GMT 04/21/06 17:36:31] <ams_c130> David - NOxy looks good O3 had a cople of spikes on it but might be related to valves switching for cals
[GMT 04/21/06 17:36:40] <ams_c130> I'll keep an eye on it

[GMT 04/21/06 19:24:42] <crounse-c130> The difference is due to the small particles i presume.

[GMT 04/21/06 20:42:22] <crounse-c130> the layer below 15 kft is dominated by the submicron particles, and seem to be pure pollution.
[GMT 04/21/06 20:42:46] <SteveHowell-hotel> I see you beat me to it.  Did the TSI neph colors converge in the dust?

[GMT 04/21/06 20:44:18] <SteveHowell-hotel> I'll be interested to hear about it when you get back.  (I noticed the bit about Angstrom coefficient just after I asked.)

[GMT 04/21/06 22:27:25] <DataSystem-c130> Teresa are you there?
[GMT 04/21/06 22:27:50] <rafchem-SeaOpsCtr> Kurt, yep..
[GMT 04/21/06 22:28:16] <JimCrawford-NASA> So how do you feel about tomorrow...Teresa mentioned CO in excess of 300 ppbv earlier, that seems more than enough to justify flying tomorrow
[GMT 04/21/06 22:28:37] <rafchem-SeaOpsCtr> Kurt, we had to re-boot the laptop to check out our new 1TB drive.  What's up?
[GMT 04/21/06 22:29:03] <DataSystem-c130> After the dsm cycle, the soft switch was still looked to be on.
[GMT 04/21/06 22:29:32] <DataSystem-c130> Do I need to cycle it as I did?
[GMT 04/21/06 22:29:32] <DataSystem-c130> Are TDL hi and lo active?
[GMT 04/21/06 22:30:41] <davidk_ops> jim, may not have NOx/O3 fixed by tomorrow
[GMT 04/21/06 22:31:28] <JimCrawford-NASA> Then I would scrub if we need to work on NOx/O3, it's too important
[GMT 04/21/06 22:32:26] <DataSystem-c130> Teresa the softswitch, cycle after dsm reboot, as I did, even though it looks to be activated?
[GMT 04/21/06 22:32:41] <JimCrawford-NASA> I could still show up at the field with a flight plan for tomorrow to file just in case, or is that too optmistic?

[GMT 04/21/06 22:34:02] <rafchem_veracruz> Kurt, TDLhi and -low are not active.  I'm not sure whether a dsm re-boot turns off the TDL, but I think it does.  We lost a few flights' worth of data at the end of MIRAGE when these sorts of problems were going on.
[GMT 04/21/06 22:34:33] <DataSystem-c130> Teresa the softswitch, cycle after dsm reboot, as I did, even though it looks to be activated?
[GMT 04/21/06 22:34:50] rafchem-SeaOpsCtr (rafchem@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Ping timeout
[GMT 04/21/06 22:34:56] <adsCockpit-c130> Jim, please do.  Do you have it planned for further south?  The main problem is that NOx and O3 aren't working, in addition to SABL. What plan did you decide on?
[GMT 04/21/06 22:35:36] <davidk_ops> jim, we may have a quick fix to get us O3 at the expense of timebase in NO2
[GMT 04/21/06 22:36:13] <DataSystem-c130> either way, I cycled the softswich.  It appeared to be on but without a variable to look at it's hard to tell. 
[GMT 04/21/06 22:37:22] <JimCrawford-NASA> The plan does not move further south...Mozart suggests we keep the same southernmost point and GMAO suggests things will actually be more toward the northern end of the flight track

[GMT 04/21/06 22:38:34] <JimCrawford-NASA> Bill,  have you seen something today that would make you want tomove things a little futher south?
[GMT 04/21/06 22:38:57] <pavel_ops> crounse-c130: John, Dave called to say that he found spare bellows, and can probably work on the relay board. I hope what I wrote makes more sense to you than it does to me.
[GMT 04/21/06 22:46:40] <adsCockpit-c130> Jim, the pollution was more evident visibly earlier in the flight and further south in the flight. Of course, the front was moving during the flight.  But since it's moving to the south and east, that makes me think that the pollution is going that way too.

[GMT 04/21/06 22:50:46] <rafchem_veracruz> Kurt, sorry I was pulled into another conversation for a bit.  Regarding the softswitch behavior on dsm re-boot, we'll be able to look at the times of file writes and get a definitive answer after today's flight.  
[GMT 04/21/06 22:51:40] <rafchem_veracruz> Kurt, from some discussions with Bill I. and others, it sounds like the troubleshooting in Veracruz involved mover invasive procedures than just re-booting the dsm.
[GMT 04/21/06 22:52:03] <rafchem_veracruz> Kurt, thanks much for your thoughtful approach to the situation.

[GMT 04/21/06 22:55:46] <DataSystem-c130> Teresa I feel good that the TDL is functional!
[GMT 04/21/06 22:56:51] <rafchem_veracruz> Yay, Kurt!  That's a relief.
[GMT 04/21/06 23:00:12] Nick change: rafchem_veracruz -> rafChem-SeattleOps
[GMT 04/21/06 23:01:36] <JimCrawford-NASA> The only reason I'm hesitant to move things is because there is no obvious change in the met that would explain higher pollution to the south (Jenny has looked at this).

[GMT 04/21/06 23:05:38] <adsCockpit-c130> Jim,  OK. There are now 3 instruments down or partly down (including SABL). We should think about what might be back on line for tomorrow.

[GMT 04/21/06 23:06:57] <JimCrawford-NASA> Andy told me that there is a very good chance that we could have O3, NO, and NOy for tomorrow...NO2 might have to be sacrificed, but that would be okay.
[GMT 04/21/06 23:07:46] <JimCrawford-NASA> What is the third instrument?
[GMT 04/21/06 23:10:51] <adsCockpit-c130> OH.  Clogged injectors. I believe that Lee thought it could be fixed pretty quickly.

[GMT 04/21/06 23:14:21] <adsCockpit-c130> Jim, unless there is something else coming this way, we really don't see much up here.  We'll do some profiling to confirm after we finish this box manuever.
[GMT 04/21/06 23:18:26] <adsCockpit-c130> Jim, we can see the thin pollution layers as we head north in this manuever. It's pretty much all around.
[GMT 04/21/06 23:26:27] <JimCrawford-NASA> This sounds like we should shade things more to the east rather than further south!?
[GMT 04/21/06 23:28:43] <davidk_ops> layers are visible?
