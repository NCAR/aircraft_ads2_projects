[GMT 05/06/06 01:01:22] <Hawaii_C130> JC:  Not bad.  Things are working.  OPC ref V is 0.83 to 0.91.  I haven't adjusted it.  Got some decent looking FMPS data.  We seem to have found the pollution layer we were looking for, but it was kind of weak.  Up high there are sometimes lots of tiny particles and often a bit of dust.
[GMT 05/06/06 01:05:42] <JC_Zhou> Steve, Thanks. Is ETA still 00:45? Do you need me at the airport?
[GMT 05/06/06 01:07:21] <Hawaii_C130> JC:  I seem to be getting PSAP spikes associated with ambient RH changes. 
[GMT 05/06/06 01:15:34] <Hawaii_C130> JC:  ETA is apparently 7:00 PM Seattle time.  I can probably catch a ride back with someone.  I'll call if I get stranded.
[GMT 05/06/06 01:20:19] <JC_Zhou> ok Steve, I will be prepared.
