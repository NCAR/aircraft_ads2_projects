[GMT 05/09/06 21:00:47] <ads-c130> That 40% is total traffic, both ways.  Split is 62% and 15%, but I don't know how to read sent vs. rcvd.  Did rdcc send that much, or was that percentage sent to rdcc...
[GMT 05/09/06 21:00:59] <Jcowan-Jeffco> No, everything is powered up for takeoff.  If it works well then there is no change after that until JUST before landing.

[GMT 05/09/06 21:01:11] <dk_ops> good point

[GMT 05/09/06 21:01:46] <MarkBradford-Boulder> How does the 40% compare to the data stream?
[GMT 05/09/06 21:02:10] <ads-c130> JC, except # of people on chat.
[GMT 05/09/06 21:03:26] <Jcowan-Jeffco> That is true the # does increase after Takeoff.
[GMT 05/09/06 21:03:44] <ads-c130> combined breakdown: 50% hercules, 40% rdcc, 6.6% malbec (datafeed)
[GMT 05/09/06 21:04:01] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Is that by bytes or # of packets?

[GMT 05/09/06 21:04:41] <ads-c130> how long on data_feed?
[GMT 05/09/06 21:05:11] <dk_ops> ~15 min
[GMT 05/09/06 21:05:14] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Bytes?  Huh, that really surprises me

[GMT 05/09/06 21:06:04] <dk_ops> more like 30, could it be buffered?
[GMT 05/09/06 21:06:27] <dk_ops> c130 is going to disappear again soon, should have some idea what to do while they're gone
[GMT 05/09/06 21:06:31] <ads-c130> I restarted the ldm 30 minutes ago.
[GMT 05/09/06 21:06:52] <ads-c130> I'm not aware of any buffering, and data is expired on the aircraft after 3 minutes.
[GMT 05/09/06 21:07:04] <dk_ops> 30 is good then
[GMT 05/09/06 21:07:07] <Jcowan-Jeffco> I find it interesting that the sent RDCC is higher then the Recvd.  I would have thought the oppisit.

[GMT 05/09/06 21:11:58] <pavel-334> My theory is, dropouts are related to time of the day and how busy the provider is.

[GMT 05/09/06 23:03:37] <dk_ops> how about b/w throttling on the gw?
[GMT 05/09/06 23:04:17] <MikeDaniels-FL> yes, that was brought up before as well
[GMT 05/09/06 23:04:51] <ads-c130> The modem does the throttling for us.  It's when things start timing out and resending.  If a chat client keeps disconnecting/reconnecting it just increases the overall use, and causes more things to time out.
[GMT 05/09/06 23:05:11] <dk_ops> a runaway condition
[GMT 05/09/06 23:05:36] <MikeDaniels-FL> but couldn't we throttle before it even gets to the modem
[GMT 05/09/06 23:05:45] <MikeDaniels-FL> at least on the way down ;-)
[GMT 05/09/06 23:06:07] <ads-c130> that's my theory...of the day.  :)
[GMT 05/09/06 23:06:48] <dk_ops> chris, had you dialed up the ping timeout on any of the xchat clients?
[GMT 05/09/06 23:07:22] <ads-c130> YEs, I set the sabl one to 3600 seconds, and 3 minutes later it timed out.
[GMT 05/09/06 23:07:41] <dk_ops> what if we set all of them to 6000 s?
[GMT 05/09/06 23:08:08] <dk_ops> _or_ set them to different numbers so there isn't a giant wave of timeouts at the same time?
[GMT 05/09/06 23:09:06] <ads-c130> Well they are all started at different times, so that should cover that issue.  The issue with setting a long timeout, is that when the iridium does redial, you won't know for a long time.
[GMT 05/09/06 23:09:20] <ads-c130> It's a catch-22.
[GMT 05/09/06 23:10:06] <jcowan> Well if there is ever a long drop they all are trying to connect and then there is a real backlog on getting chat going.
[GMT 05/09/06 23:10:40] <jcowan> Those 10 to 20 minute Iridium drop out make it so all the chat clients are connecting at the same time.
[GMT 05/09/06 23:10:44] <John_Crounse_OPS> someone tell mccabe i'm chatting on hawaii_c130
[GMT 05/09/06 23:12:35] <dk_ops> yes, if all have short timeouts, all will reconnect at similar times
[GMT 05/09/06 23:14:39] jcowan (jcowan@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Ping timeout
[GMT 05/09/06 23:15:30] <MikeDaniels-FL> chris, do you think you have enough detail of actual traffic?
[GMT 05/09/06 23:15:52] <ads-c130> In what sense?

[GMT 05/09/06 23:16:06] <MikeDaniels-FL> tcpdump-ish
[GMT 05/09/06 23:17:40] <MarkBradford-Boulder> If we have a system on the plane with a ton of disk, it would be interesting to use tcpdump to capture an entire flight's traffic, then go nuts with statistical tools
[GMT 05/09/06 23:18:24] <ads-c130> I haven't captured any packets.  I've been watching ntop for two days.  I need to see where/how it stores data, and if viewing history is possible.
[GMT 05/09/06 23:18:27] <adsCockpit-c130> Besides the dust layer, it seems that we have not been as successful in past flights of catching pollution layers. 
[GMT 05/09/06 23:18:46] <ads-c130> Maybe should use etherel for a while and store it.
[GMT 05/09/06 23:18:53] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Wouldn't even need to be a ton of disk, actually -- 10 hours of full bandwidth at 2400 baud is only 9 megabytes or so
[GMT 05/09/06 23:19:12] <MarkBradford-Boulder> We could capture the full datastream, timestamped, and do forensics
[GMT 05/09/06 23:19:30] <MikeDaniels-FL> that's what i was thinking

[GMT 05/09/06 23:22:15] <ads-c130> how does ethereal compare to tcpdump ?
[GMT 05/09/06 23:23:08] <dk_ops> is stefania on?
[GMT 05/09/06 23:23:09] <MarkBradford-Boulder> similar type of program, I believe, though I haven't worked much with ethereal
[GMT 05/09/06 23:23:43] <DMT-C130> I'm on. stef
[GMT 05/09/06 23:23:58] <MarkBradford-Boulder> ethereal is semi-notorious for being full of buffer overflows and such
[GMT 05/09/06 23:27:09] <ads-c130> scp'ing a 20k file to ground - /h/9/cjw/ss.png shows todays graph.
[GMT 05/09/06 23:27:33] <ads-c130> sorry, Screenshot.png
[GMT 05/09/06 23:27:41] <dk_ops> dropouts increasing in size
[GMT 05/09/06 23:28:12] <ads-c130> bw paeking at 6kbps
[GMT 05/09/06 23:28:59] <ads-c130> is it done?

[GMT 05/09/06 23:30:19] <MikeDaniels-FL> yes, done
[GMT 05/09/06 23:31:07] <ads-c130> ok, Current day graph.  first "drop-out" is a redial on the ground, so take-off shortly after.
[GMT 05/09/06 23:31:33] <ads-c130> 2nd drop-out was real.  Took 3 min for Iridium to redial, 2min spent with NOCARRIER.
[GMT 05/09/06 23:31:56] <ads-c130> See the dip down to 2.5kbps, that's when things got good.

[GMT 05/09/06 23:35:23] <ads-c130> so I should put something in /etc/ppp/ip-up like 'tcpdump -i ppp0 >> /tmp/tcpd.log'
[GMT 05/09/06 23:36:31] <ads-c130> stefania not installed.
[GMT 05/09/06 23:36:44] <MarkBradford-Boulder> I'd use the -w option to tcpdump to capture the packets

[GMT 05/09/06 23:42:02] <MarkBradford-Boulder> so something like tcpdump -n -i ppp0 -w /var/tmp/ppp.dump
[GMT 05/09/06 23:42:34] <MarkBradford-Boulder> I *think* we could then later use etherape to do graphic analysis of the traffic.  We can definitely read back out of the file with tcpdump and generate some stats.
[GMT 05/09/06 23:42:54] <ads-c130> just saw the -w op.
