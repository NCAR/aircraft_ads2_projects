[GMT 04/28/06 18:47:41] <SteveHowell-hotel> JC:  When back in clear air you might try opening the lag chamber in case it's filled with a prodigious number of particles.  It probably won't work, but it's easy to try.

[GMT 04/28/06 18:53:40] <DMT-C130> GregK:  Manually control of the proportional valve seems to help during the ascents -- but the flow is not critical so it changes over the profile (i.e., 2.7 V = 500 ccm at 1000 mb; 3.0 V = 500 ccm at 550 mb).  We can correct the auto flow issues during post-processing, so I'll leave it on auto for now.

Indeed, by moving the frit, we will have to modify the control program to regulate the valve based on total flow -- this should be a relatively straight forward modification to the code.
