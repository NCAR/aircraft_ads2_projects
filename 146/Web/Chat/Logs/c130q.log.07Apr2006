[GMT 04/07/06 15:11:37] <DataSystem-c130> Hello out there!
[GMT 04/07/06 15:15:02] <truss-boulder> hello in theer
[GMT 04/07/06 15:15:25] <DataSystem-c130> Added firewall to hercules, just testing it out.
[GMT 04/07/06 15:15:42] <truss-boulder> great, is this Janet?
[GMT 04/07/06 15:15:52] <DataSystem-c130> That's right!
[GMT 04/07/06 15:16:02] <truss-boulder> what did you use for the firewall?
[GMT 04/07/06 15:16:47] <DataSystem-c130> I used the iptables.sh script to setup the iptables file.  We use this on the GV.
[GMT 04/07/06 15:16:57] <truss-boulder> great
[GMT 04/07/06 15:17:02] <truss-boulder> how's the speed?
[GMT 04/07/06 15:17:32] <DataSystem-c130> All traffic between internal interfaces is trusted.
[GMT 04/07/06 15:17:48] <DataSystem-c130> Speed seems fine.
[GMT 04/07/06 15:17:58] <truss-boulder> good job
[GMT 04/07/06 15:18:18] <DataSystem-c130> I'm not doing this over Iridium though, just over the guest network.
[GMT 04/07/06 15:18:36] <DataSystem-c130> Next test will be over Iridium when they pull the plane out.
[GMT 04/07/06 15:18:58] <truss-boulder> are theere lots of "drop" messages showing up in /var/log/messages?
[GMT 04/07/06 15:19:32] <truss-boulder> or are any of the other systems even turned on?
[GMT 04/07/06 15:21:30] <DataSystem-c130> No drop messages, although I think the iptables stuff limits the drop messages.
[GMT 04/07/06 15:21:52] <DataSystem-c130> Only clyde is turned on.  I have to start chat on clyde.

[GMT 04/07/06 15:22:55] <laptop-c130> hello from clyde
[GMT 04/07/06 15:23:02] <truss-boulder> yo
[GMT 04/07/06 15:24:35] <DataSystem-c130> BTW, the problems with the pod dsms not booting turned out to be network and power supply issues.
[GMT 04/07/06 15:25:07] <truss-boulder> hmm, what were the network issues? cabling?
[GMT 04/07/06 15:25:39] <DataSystem-c130> One was a connector issue not making good contact.
[GMT 04/07/06 15:26:29] <truss-boulder> when does it leave for Seattle?
[GMT 04/07/06 15:27:12] <DataSystem-c130> April 17
