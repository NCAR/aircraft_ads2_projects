[GMT 05/12/06 19:48:20] <GTRDC-DFRC> hello
[GMT 05/12/06 19:50:44] <ICATS_DC8> Hello World
[GMT 05/12/06 19:51:04] <ICATS_DC8> Getting weather pics is AOK on 4 channels
[GMT 05/12/06 19:51:32] <ICATS_DC8> Sending email attachments on 4 channels is SLOOOOOOOWER

[GMT 05/12/06 19:54:24] <ICATS_DC8> Howdy 
[GMT 05/12/06 19:54:31] <ICATS_DC8> Want me to tell Dr Bob?
[GMT 05/12/06 19:55:27] <GTCIMS_DC8> ok, Bob is here
[GMT 05/12/06 19:58:00] <GTRDC-DFRC> greetings (this is larry).  How's the 4 channel configuration working for you so far?
[GMT 05/12/06 19:58:40] <GTRDC-DFRC> are the weather pcks being pullded via HTTP?
[GMT 05/12/06 19:59:31] <GTRDC-DFRC> email uses TCP-based protocols
[GMT 05/12/06 20:00:46] <GTRDC-DFRC> I wonder about XChat - could be either TCP or UDP
[GMT 05/12/06 20:00:48] <ICATS_DC8> Yes the weather pics are web based
[GMT 05/12/06 20:01:01] <ICATS_DC8> So is my UND email
[GMT 05/12/06 20:01:29] <GTRDC-DFRC> I'm guessing HTTP stuff is now all UDP based (was TCP in beginning)
[GMT 05/12/06 20:01:51] <ICATS_DC8> looks like Xchat deals with the reduction iun channels just fine
[GMT 05/12/06 20:02:04] <GTRDC-DFRC> agreed
[GMT 05/12/06 20:04:20] <GTRDC-DFRC> I'd guess the email attachment is TCP  and as soon as you get one bit error in a packet, everything will slow down.
[GMT 05/12/06 20:05:45] <GTRDC-DFRC> and i'd bet you slip in an out of areas that are noiser than 1E-05 several times an hour
[GMT 05/12/06 20:06:45] <GTRDC-DFRC> hey, is Carl on the plane?
[GMT 05/12/06 20:06:46] <ICATS_DC8> I'll let you guys figure out all the pipe issues
[GMT 05/12/06 20:07:17] <ICATS_DC8> I'll try and see iwe on the DC8 can keep packits in the pipe
[GMT 05/12/06 20:07:29] <ICATS_DC8> No :-(  
[GMT 05/12/06 20:07:32] <ICATS_DC8> He wimped out
[GMT 05/12/06 20:08:50] <GTRDC-DFRC> wimp? not carl. working on altair coding maybe?
[GMT 05/12/06 20:09:37] <ICATS_DC8> I understand that at COB yeterday he had a seat
[GMT 05/12/06 20:09:48] <ICATS_DC8> BUT I do hope he is working on code
[GMT 05/12/06 20:11:04] <GTRDC-DFRC> working on code or taking a hike in the mountains - both are high priority in my book
[GMT 05/12/06 20:12:39] <ICATS_DC8> We did get a couple of pics 4 your daughter
[GMT 05/12/06 20:17:12] <GTRDC-DFRC> you mean of "flat jessica"?

[GMT 05/12/06 20:26:17] <ICATS_DC8> lost the pipe
[GMT 05/12/06 20:26:47] <GTRDC-DFRC> I claim satcom dropped the handoff between satellites
[GMT 05/12/06 20:26:51] <ICATS_DC8> working another weather pic for Hank
[GMT 05/12/06 20:26:56] <GTRDC-DFRC> REVEAL dropped same time

[GMT 05/12/06 22:59:32] <ICATS_DC8> What do you do on the IDL map plots when you cross +/- 180??
[GMT 05/12/06 22:59:38] <ICATS_DC8> What a PAIN
[GMT 05/12/06 23:09:42] <CarlS_Anchorage> Hello Dr Scott!
[GMT 05/12/06 23:10:58] <CarlS_Anchorage> There is a way but I can't remember it. Something to do with turning off auto-everything and specifying [lat,lon] as 0-360 or even 0-720
[GMT 05/12/06 23:14:04] <ICATS_DC8> I just sent the Hang man an email on the issue
[GMT 05/12/06 23:14:54] <CarlS_Anchorage> Did you check your email? I sent you one around takeoff time
[GMT 05/12/06 23:15:11] <ICATS_DC8> yes I got it
[GMT 05/12/06 23:15:27] <CarlS_Anchorage> cool
[GMT 05/12/06 23:15:40] <ICATS_DC8> did have a xchat with LF during the 1st hour of the flight
[GMT 05/12/06 23:15:47] <CarlS_Anchorage> Very cool
[GMT 05/12/06 23:15:54] <CarlS_Anchorage> Wish I were there
[GMT 05/12/06 23:15:58] <ICATS_DC8> no 
[GMT 05/12/06 23:16:03] <ICATS_DC8> that KEWL!!!
[GMT 05/12/06 23:17:01] <CarlS_Anchorage> KEWL!!!
[GMT 05/12/06 23:17:08] <CarlS_Anchorage> yep that's better
[GMT 05/12/06 23:17:53] <ICATS_DC8> 4 channels works 4  xchat and getting weather maps
[GMT 05/12/06 23:18:14] <ICATS_DC8> 4 channels does not work so well for UND email
[GMT 05/12/06 23:19:41] <ICATS_DC8> time 4 another Hank weather image
[GMT 05/12/06 23:31:41] <ICATS_DC8> We have a printer tonner issue
[GMT 05/12/06 23:31:48] <ICATS_DC8> It's low on Blue
[GMT 05/12/06 23:39:54] <CarlS_Anchorage> might be one in the blue (green?) box
[GMT 05/12/06 23:40:01] <CarlS_Anchorage> John sez hi!
[GMT 05/12/06 23:40:42] <ICATS_DC8> Rudy found the toner and he needed the book to take it apart
[GMT 05/12/06 23:41:04] <ICATS_DC8> Tell JDWB that 2 stage and Cryo are working fine
[GMT 05/12/06 23:42:34] <CarlS_Anchorage> JDWB says to keep those voltages straight! 
[GMT 05/12/06 23:44:11] <ICATS_DC8> Not my department, he/they have a Langley man on the job
[GMT 05/12/06 23:47:10] <ICATS_DC8> DC8 will B open 10 to 4:30 Sat
[GMT 05/12/06 23:47:18] <CarlS_Anchorage> JDWB has left the building (had a good laugh first)
[GMT 05/12/06 23:49:50] <CarlS_Anchorage> Was downloading Henry's Wx more lengthy than usual?

[GMT 05/12/06 23:58:55] <ICATS_DC8> Hello WOrld
[GMT 05/12/06 23:59:05] <ICATS_DC8> I had to reboot the 4 channel
[GMT 05/12/06 23:59:32] <ICATS_DC8> It takes about the same amount of time to get Hank his weather images 
[GMT 05/12/06 23:59:55] <ICATS_DC8> So 4 or 10 channel we would go with 4 just to save Larry a few $$$
