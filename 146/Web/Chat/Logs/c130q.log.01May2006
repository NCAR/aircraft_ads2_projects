[GMT 05/01/06 21:29:36] <greg> stef, shutoff the CCN & close its inlet -- folding it over with a cable tie should work.  If you can't close the inlet to the CCN, then shut off the SP2 as well and close the common inlet/exhaust valves for both of them. 
[GMT 05/01/06 21:30:08] <Hawaii_C130> greg,  I have nothing to plug the CCN inlet
[GMT 05/01/06 21:30:25] <dknapp_ops> frank, can you unplug noxyo3 network for 3 minutes, but tell me when you do?

[GMT 05/01/06 21:33:36] <John_Crounse_OPS> Stef, if you ask david mccabe he will give you cable ties.  He also has some swage plugs/caps, but probably nothing bigger than 1/4"

[GMT 05/01/06 23:52:12] <drp> Jim, the winds look like they should be between about 330 (WNW) and 315 (NW), based on forecasts.  I would go with 330
[GMT 05/01/06 23:54:10] <adsCockpit-c130> Ok thanks, we will try for the flexpart enhancement rather than the Mt Bachelor upwind sampling
[GMT 05/01/06 23:54:50] <mporter_MET_ops> i just looked at the ARPS short range model (12km)... it agrees... 25kts 330 deg all along that leg
[GMT 05/01/06 23:54:56] <adsCockpit-c130> BTW, flexpart was our only clear "hit" today.
[GMT 05/01/06 23:55:15] <mporter_MET_ops> you will almost be upwind of Mt Bachelor when you are crossing the Columbia river
