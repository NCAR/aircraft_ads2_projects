[GMT 05/03/06 19:10:25] <ams_c130> Becky: Things are going well.  Peroxy radicals, OH and HNO3 working great.  NH3 has some low reagent ion signals today for some reason.  Also, couldn't get the Hg lamp to light at highest altitude, but worked fine at intermediate altitudes.
[GMT 05/03/06 19:11:01] <BeckyAnderson_Boulder> Chris - I'm in &CIMS if you want to move over.

[GMT 05/03/06 21:22:17] <mporter_MET_ops> Jim, Lenny and I just checked the latest satellite image and there is definately some cirrus drifting over fresno
[GMT 05/03/06 21:22:36] <mporter_MET_ops> it's patchy and thin, but not as wispy as we'd like
[GMT 05/03/06 21:23:47] <mporter_MET_ops> if we're lucky it will glide out of there by your approach
