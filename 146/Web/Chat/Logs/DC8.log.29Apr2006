[GMT 04/29/06 00:29:13] <ICATS_DC8> I'm up
[GMT 04/29/06 00:29:23] <ICATS_DC8> Trying for a Hank cloud pic on the deck
[GMT 04/29/06 00:29:35] <ICATS_DC8> CB can print but is NOT using ftp :-)
[GMT 04/29/06 00:29:49] <ICATS_DC8> Does she have a real print deamon?
[GMT 04/29/06 00:30:49] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> okay
[GMT 04/29/06 00:30:55] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> no
[GMT 04/29/06 00:31:39] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> she has always used ftp, why she isn't now is beyond me, but if it is working for her that's fine.
[GMT 04/29/06 00:31:58] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> we found the correct file to modify so she will be able to see the printer all the time.
[GMT 04/29/06 00:32:47] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> I now have all the cd images I need so we can rebuild the nav computer.
[GMT 04/29/06 00:33:07] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> I'm in the process of making the cd's, 1 for vmware and 5 for rhel.
[GMT 04/29/06 00:33:23] <ICATS_DC8> SHe now needs the drivers on her notebook
[GMT 04/29/06 00:33:23] <ICATS_DC8> Sounds easy UNTIL
[GMT 04/29/06 00:33:37] <ICATS_DC8> she said "NO CD drive"
[GMT 04/29/06 00:33:50] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> do you have the drivers up there?
[GMT 04/29/06 00:34:11] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> I think they are on one of the pc's in the Software directory
[GMT 04/29/06 00:34:18] <ICATS_DC8> The CD you gave me
[GMT 04/29/06 00:34:23] <ICATS_DC8> NOT
[GMT 04/29/06 00:35:08] <ICATS_DC8> the  RudMan  should have the REAL disks 
[GMT 04/29/06 00:35:57] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> They are on pc#2 on the E drive in the Software directory
[GMT 04/29/06 00:37:06] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> Does she have a usb port?
[GMT 04/29/06 00:37:36] <ICATS_DC8> So we can ftp them to the sun and than over onto her pc
[GMT 04/29/06 00:37:59] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> unfortunately ftp on the sun doesn't work, unless you can get it going
[GMT 04/29/06 00:38:02] <ICATS_DC8> got to go
[GMT 04/29/06 00:38:06] <Sky_Yarbrough_grnd> bye
[GMT 04/29/06 00:38:11] <ICATS_DC8> Hanks pic is coming over

[GMT 04/29/06 06:11:01] <Sky-ESCD> Mark from Boulder hung up as it is late there.  But he thought the DC-8 stuff was real cool.
[GMT 04/29/06 06:11:06] <Sky-ESCD> That
[GMT 04/29/06 06:11:12] <Sky-ESCD> That's true

[GMT 04/29/06 06:12:40] <Sky-ESCD> How's all on your end?  All is okay here, especially when we get the nav computer rebuilt tomorrow.

[GMT 04/29/06 06:15:21] <Sky-ESCD> Red Hat doesn't support Fire Wire at all and won't for a while, as in years
[GMT 04/29/06 06:15:36] <Sky-ESCD> However, Linux is 'open source' so I
[GMT 04/29/06 06:15:56] <Sky-ESCD> 'm sure someone has a fire wire driver for Red Hat maybe.
[GMT 04/29/06 06:16:29] <Sky-ESCD> I say lets just go with SuSE which does support Fire Wire and get a waver.
[GMT 04/29/06 06:16:36] <LarryFreudingerMobile> my kbd on kitchen table.... have a honey-do list dovetailed in with this conversation
[GMT 04/29/06 06:17:04] <LarryFreudingerMobile> keep talikng, but maybe a 5 minute lag here/tere
[GMT 04/29/06 06:17:09] <Sky-ESCD> I know that feeling, 'cept my honey do list is coming long distance
[GMT 04/29/06 06:17:59] <Sky-ESCD> May be a lag on my end too, it's after 5 and I may have to go after more ice.
[GMT 04/29/06 06:18:29] <LarryFreudingerMobile> in hotel room?
[GMT 04/29/06 06:18:33] <Sky-ESCD> Yes

[GMT 04/29/06 06:21:33] <Sky-ESCD> Have you read the e-mail from Carl concerning the death of his Beloved Uncle?
[GMT 04/29/06 06:22:11] <LarryFreudingerMobile> no - only your reply to him
[GMT 04/29/06 06:25:23] <Sky-ESCD> Okay, well that says it all.  As I asked of you, I'm not looking forward to AK, however we need to support the mission.  If we don't support it all the way through, then we will  be looked at not being able to give full support no matter what happens.  It is very important to keep suceeding and never give up or stall.
[GMT 04/29/06 06:26:06] <LarryFreudingerMobile> Sky, it's Cathy.  I must drag Larry away for a high priority mission to search for plastic forks.  We have 40 people coming over tomorrow and the forks are MIA.  And you think DC-8 has problems!  
[GMT 04/29/06 06:26:56] <Sky-ESCD> Quick, transport here, the Hilton has plenty of forks, knives and such.  Take all you want.
[GMT 04/29/06 06:27:29] <Sky-ESCD> 7-11 just down the steet, open 24 hours
[GMT 04/29/06 06:30:25] <Sky-ESCD> Cathy & Larry, enjoy the evening, take it slow, get lots of sleep and take a deep breath, all is okay and will be Bless by our Lord God Almightly.  May tomorrow be a Holy and Blessed day for you, your daughter and all family members.  God bless, signing off, Sky
[GMT 04/29/06 06:32:04] <LarryFreudingerMobile> 4th down, tiime to punt.  we'll spend another $7 tomorrow
[GMT 04/29/06 06:33:09] <LarryFreudingerMobile> regarding "never give up or stall"...
[GMT 04/29/06 06:35:12] <LarryFreudingerMobile> every day we wake up at the shore of the Mississippi
[GMT 04/29/06 06:35:23] <LarryFreudingerMobile> our task is to consume it
[GMT 04/29/06 06:36:42] <LarryFreudingerMobile> If I can just give up and stall less than you, I've had a good day
[GMT 04/29/06 06:37:18] <Sky-ESCD> always been told I've got the BIGGEST MOUTH they've ever seen or heard, so give up is not an option, just a diversion
[GMT 04/29/06 06:37:37] <LarryFreudingerMobile> It's a mixed metaphor, but I run a distant third, no, 4th
[GMT 04/29/06 06:38:12] <Sky-ESCD> i know what you're saying
[GMT 04/29/06 06:39:15] <LarryFreudingerMobile> BTW I saw Brent today (my sister hed never seen Dryden)
[GMT 04/29/06 06:39:42] <LarryFreudingerMobile> He looks much better than I expected; no discernable limping or anything
[GMT 04/29/06 06:39:44] <Sky-ESCD> Cool, how'd she like it?
[GMT 04/29/06 06:39:56] <LarryFreudingerMobile> rash on his arm though
[GMT 04/29/06 06:40:16] <Sky-ESCD> Great, he sounded good today while helping me with the CD's and such
[GMT 04/29/06 06:40:17] <LarryFreudingerMobile> and my sister said he probably has pins in his arm
[GMT 04/29/06 06:40:26] <Sky-ESCD> NOT!
[GMT 04/29/06 06:40:38] <Sky-ESCD> probably should tho!

I will go to AK as you know, but I need to know as soon as possible
[GMT 04/29/06 06:43:11] <Sky-ESCD> Why the time out I don't know
[GMT 04/29/06 06:43:36] <Sky-ESCD> It happens to the DC-8 too.
[GMT 04/29/06 06:43:44] <LFreudinger> no.  when he says he stays it's time for you to stick to your guns
[GMT 04/29/06 06:43:52] <Sky-ESCD> I've only had it once here.
[GMT 04/29/06 06:44:35] <LFreudinger> umm, I mean I should go, and drag brent if itr will fill any capability gaps
[GMT 04/29/06 06:44:58] <LFreudinger> however, I have a Altair responsibility 2 May
[GMT 04/29/06 06:45:22] <Sky-ESCD> Guns / Smungs, if the nav computer is not 100% no one else can fix it besides me.  I designed it and set it up.
[GMT 04/29/06 06:45:26] <LFreudinger> and I don't even keep track of non-science crap I
[GMT 04/29/06 06:45:27] <Sky-ESCD> You have may 2
[GMT 04/29/06 06:45:41] <Sky-ESCD> Carl has May 16 and 17
[GMT 04/29/06 06:45:45] <LFreudinger> ve been blowing off thiis week (Mississippi)
[GMT 04/29/06 06:46:53] <Sky-ESCD> Pardon me, but restroom and more ice, will be right back if you wish to hang in there, I know it's 11:45PM for you.
[GMT 04/29/06 06:47:16] <LFreudinger> Our stuff seems OK; focus on the computer (it's tech nically not your problem)
[GMT 04/29/06 06:50:02] <LFreudinger> get the ice, I just opened another can.  The family stuff is done for tonight - resume ~5:30am; Cathy wathing TV; visitors & kids all sleeping
[GMT 04/29/06 06:51:34] <Sky-ESCD> I'm  back, flat pepsi.  Let me read what you wrote.
[GMT 04/29/06 06:52:04] <LFreudinger> thinking about post-flight operation... maybe pull a disk a,d pug it in witout any other responsibility on our part will minimize turnaround time
[GMT 04/29/06 06:52:23] <LFreudinger> sorry about typing
[GMT 04/29/06 06:52:52] <Sky-ESCD> Just had that thought about typing, trying to read it.
[GMT 04/29/06 06:53:38] <LFreudinger> ...disk and plug it in without...
[GMT 04/29/06 06:54:12] <Sky-ESCD> So what I see you saying is, 1.  removable HDD, 2. plug in 'somewhere' 3. auto detection, 4. auto process / download
[GMT 04/29/06 06:55:22] <Sky-ESCD> So next level, nothing moves, just intellegent 'wireless'.  Looks for the proper SSID, connects and downloads.
[GMT 04/29/06 06:55:33] <LFreudinger> yeah. the thought is "here is your data in format you can handle, you take it from here"
[GMT 04/29/06 06:56:14] <LFreudinger> umm, separate the disk location issue from the woreless connection issue
[GMT 04/29/06 06:56:52] <LFreudinger> How about a 4GB flash disk rather than a whole drive?
[GMT 04/29/06 06:57:01] <LFreudinger> that's what Shetter uses.
[GMT 04/29/06 06:57:21] <Sky-ESCD> Disk location is same as REVEAL location (maybe), but with intellegent download it shouldn't matter.
[GMT 04/29/06 06:57:42] <Sky-ESCD> Why do we need human intervention?
[GMT 04/29/06 06:58:15] <LFreudinger> eventually, intelligent download/transport will take care of it.  I'm thinking TC-4, where "intelligent" is still a stretch.
[GMT 04/29/06 06:59:25] <Sky-ESCD> TC-4 is the 'PERFECT' place to do 'intellegent' downloads' as a demo.  With of course as you state, 4GB thumb drives or such.
[GMT 04/29/06 06:59:41] <LFreudinger> so, what timestamp should I look for on Carl's email describing uncle passing?

[GMT 04/29/06 07:00:32] <LFreudinger> We can do "uatomated scripting" in TC4, but intelligence as I see it is still 5-10 years out
[GMT 04/29/06 07:00:34] <Sky-ESCD> Re all the stuff in Hawaii - see, it's good you went, everything that broke is stuff you know how to fix better than I do.
[GMT 04/29/06 07:00:37] <Sky-ESCD> As it stands I arrive in Anchorage Monday night, sounds like I would not fly on the Tuesday flight. My beloved only uncle passed away today and I will probably not decide if I'm going anyway or rescheduling before Monday morning.
[GMT 04/29/06 07:00:40] <Sky-ESCD> I do have hand-drawn cable drawings done, parts ordered, and the Eagle file for the card will be done soon, probably tonight. I will send you and Glo the file for ordering, and leave the drawings on my desk (make copies, I would like to get them back). I reckon Brent should get them into the system as real drawings.
[GMT 04/29/06 07:00:44] <Sky-ESCD> Re the Nav Station computer: it probably finally died of embarassment from that ugly-ass web page Scott was serving ;) (don't repeat to Scott please)
[GMT 04/29/06 07:00:47] <Sky-ESCD> --Carl
[GMT 04/29/06 07:01:00] <Sky-ESCD> We have different levels of 'intellegence'
[GMT 04/29/06 07:01:02] <LFreudinger> ok, I saw that.
[GMT 04/29/06 07:02:03] <LFreudinger> If scott sees this log, I hope he'll forgive Carls jab
[GMT 04/29/06 07:02:52] <Sky-ESCD> True intellegence in networking and data 'auto posting' is probably 5 -10 year out, but I think we are here already of doing some of the simple stuff.
[GMT 04/29/06 07:03:33] <Sky-ESCD> He won't see it because he is not logged on, that why I felt is was okay to send it this way.
[GMT 04/29/06 07:03:36] <LFreudinger> like all life in an evolution, one step at a time
[GMT 04/29/06 07:05:13] <Sky-ESCD> XChat is fast, but it doesnt' interupt your typing if you're trying to say something and the other person is still typing.
[GMT 04/29/06 07:07:45] <Sky-ESCD> Larry, if we already have one button data processing, 'once we have the data', and we are at the point we can obtain the data in a 'one' or 'two' click process, then why aren't we at the point of auto-data-analysis-posting?  I'll tell you why.........................................................................................
[GMT 04/29/06 07:08:15] <LFreudinger> tell me...
[GMT 04/29/06 07:08:39] <LFreudinger> unless you would rather I fill in the blanks
[GMT 04/29/06 07:09:49] <Sky-ESCD> it's because the Gov't GAO won't allow us to have proper networks to allow for:  (off site prining), (immediate unlimited ftp), (open ssh / sftp), (free data transfer of any mission), etc.
[GMT 04/29/06 07:10:26] <Sky-ESCD> No you don't need to fill in the blanks, unless you want to keep going on what I already said.
[GMT 04/29/06 07:14:11] <LFreudinger> I understand the complaint, but want to say "baloney" ... we can succeed in spite of the gauntlet of beuracracy.
[GMT 04/29/06 07:14:38] <LFreudinger> you know I'm not a fan or working within the system
[GMT 04/29/06 07:14:50] <LFreudinger> or establisd process
[GMT 04/29/06 07:15:28] <LFreudinger> but our job is to create new capabilities
[GMT 04/29/06 07:16:18] <LFreudinger> and automation inherentlky involves new capabilities
[GMT 04/29/06 07:16:41] <Sky-ESCD> Let's see......."The INTERNET circa 1983", anywhere, anytime, anydatat, anyinfo:  keep out the rats, information highway.......The "INTERNET" circa 2006, nowhere, notime, no-good-info, full-of-virus, full--o-lies, slow, bogged down, spam filled,etc.etc.etc.etc..............
[GMT 04/29/06 07:17:09] <Sky-ESCD> yes there are new capabilities, but when can we use them?
[GMT 04/29/06 07:17:50] <Sky-ESCD> We (Suborbital personel) don't have a 'private' world accessble server for data.
[GMT 04/29/06 07:18:04] <LFreudinger>  yeah, but here we are on our Gov machines using IRC
[GMT 04/29/06 07:18:25] <LFreudinger> and the system is peky
[GMT 04/29/06 07:18:30] <LFreudinger> perky
[GMT 04/29/06 07:19:04] <Sky-ESCD> I can't get configuration data from our own data archvies about REVEAL or other system setups.
[GMT 04/29/06 07:19:15] <Sky-ESCD> perky you say?????????????????yea it
[GMT 04/29/06 07:19:54] <Sky-ESCD> PERKY you say....................yea, it's perky, but neither of us in "INSIDE" the

[GMT 04/29/06 07:20:47] <Sky-ESCD> WE know it doesn' work.
[GMT 04/29/06 07:21:34] <Sky-ESCD> DC, XChat, yes that does work GREAT.
[GMT 04/29/06 07:21:47] <LFreudinger> you raise some good points that might ve solvabl with Dennis' approach to VLAN.
[GMT 04/29/06 07:22:13] <Sky-ESCD> Yes, I think so.
[GMT 04/29/06 07:22:20] <Sky-ESCD> HOWEVER:
[GMT 04/29/06 07:22:57] <Sky-ESCD> That would require a document that allows 'immediate
[GMT 04/29/06 07:23:31] <Sky-ESCD> system chages.(sorry, I hit return)
[GMT 04/29/06 07:25:53] <LFreudinger> I was just thinking that via:   Convincing CIO to give up control if we can minimize risk of bad outcomes is our hurdle?
[GMT 04/29/06 07:26:47] <LFreudinger> ok, I need sleep.  let's think about requirements to feed to dennis
[GMT 04/29/06 07:26:54] <Sky-ESCD> I DO NOT WANT AN ANSER RIGHT NOW.  Think about it, IF Carl says he needs to be here for the funeral and family stuff, I will go to AK.  I just need to know as soon as possible.  It will also require a call from you to LK stating the change in my orders.
[GMT 04/29/06 07:27:30] <Sky-ESCD> I agree, see above statement and sleep on it through tomorrow night.
[GMT 04/29/06 07:27:41] <LFreudinger> ok.
