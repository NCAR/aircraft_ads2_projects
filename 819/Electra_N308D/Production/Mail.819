HI Ron;Thanks for your weekly report,I like it.It is very informative.
As far as CEPEX is concerned it will be identical to TOGA COARE,we need to change the name and project number only.I will send you an updated tape list
for your file.But before you do anything else lets crank through T-C first.
Regards Paul

Paul,

Thanks.  I already copied the file into my CEPEX directory, so you don't have
to keep it.

I'll let Vince field questions while you're on vacation.

Paul,

There are differences in the header between TOGA-COARE and CEPEX.  I expect
them to be minor, but I'm glad you dumped that header for me.  Were these
changes made before the project and never changed, or could there be changes
within the project that I should be aware of (i.e., should we dump more

Paul,

Thanks for your memo regarding final processing for CEPEX.  I will set up the
processing to be essentially identical with TOGA-COARE.  For the non-extant
UV Hygrometer I'll insert the GENPRO "bogus value" of 99999. in all the
appropriate places.  I will not output any wet-bulb temperature data (XWB...),
and no total water calculations will be done (only raw voltages output).
I will ignore Hagan's data.  I assume that no event markers were used.
I will use the same reference state-variable sensors.

Here are some questions for you:

1)  What wire temperature should I use for PLWC?  It was 165C at the end of
     TOGA-COARE.
2)  What constants should I use for the two Lyman-Alpha probes?  At the end of
     TOGA-COARE they were:
      CX1   CX2      CX3     CX4         XC
     (0.23, 0.2826,  0.1392, -0.007965), 0.25  <-- VLA
     (5.8,  0.2280, -0.0349,  0.000037), 0.25  <-- VLA1
3)  Is the PMS-D probe configuration on the aircraft the same as it was for
     TOGA-COARE's RF31 and RF32?
4)  What Lat/Lon coordinates should I use as a reference?

I have a header dump from RF09 which shows that the FSSP is sampled at a rate
of 1/second instead of 10/second as was done for TOGA-COARE.  Was this change
made before the project began or sometime into the project?  In either case I
need to adjust the GENPRO processor to handle this new rate.

So much for "identical;" it's now "similar."

Paul,

The ADS header shows a FSSP to be sampled at 1/second.  Since it was not
mounted, I presume you want me to remove FSSP processing from GENPRO.

To your knowledge, were any other changes made either before or during
the project that would affect the header (sensors added, deleted, moved,
etc.)?  I'd rather not have any more surprises.

Paul,

I've been thinking about this FSSP thing.  As you may know, I was supposed to
keep the CEPEX GENPRO output data format the same as for TOGA-COARE.  That way
anyone accessing the two data sets won't have to change their setup to get
data from either project.  (Is this really a requirement?)  The lack of an FSSP
on the project and the header change which made its rate=1 instead of =10 poses
a dilemma for me.

There is space in TOGA-COARE for 260X, PCAS and FSSP data.  The missing probe
has zero data put into its output space.  Regarding the FSSP, if I keep the
same rate as TOGA-COARE, garbage data will be put into the FSSP processing.
There is a possiblity it could cause GENPRO to crash.  (We could take that
chance.)

If I adapt the processor to the data rate in the CEPEX header, the output
format will change, but GENPRO won't be reading garbage.

The only way I see around this dilemma, if it exists, is to write a dummy FSSP
processing subroutine that would output zeros in all the right places.

Any suggestions?

Paul,

I certainly could delete the FSSP altogether.  The only question about doing
that is whether to remain compatible with the TOGA-COARE output data format.

Is there no requirement that they both be the same?

To turn off the FSSP is to imply that its data disappear from the output.
That, in turn, changes the format.  I'll ask Dick about it.

     I talked to PSD.  We agreed that it is ok and probably the best thing
to do to remove the FSSP from the CPEX data processing all together.  The
projects are entirely different from a PI involvement so there is really no
need to keep the formats the same.  When we said make no changes that was
with the idea that it would save effort.  However, Paul neglected to mention
in the beginning that the FSSP was not being used on the project and he
apparently was unaware that the rate had been changed to 1 from 10.

Paul,

I have a plot file for your perusal; it is:  /home/local/migs/ron/pltRF09.819
             There is a companion log file:  /home/local/migs/ron/logRF09.819


Since there was no FSSP, how do you want me to correct LWC.  For TOGA-COARE
I used CONCF as a reference to zero out the probe when in clear air.  I could
use the old "non-zeroed" code.  The variable name (with FSSP as reference)
is LWCCZ; the other one is LWCC.  The alternative is not to correct it at all.

Paul,

More on my review of RF09:

I noticed that neither of Friehe's temperature probes were registering
anything.  Were these removed from CEPEX?

None of the liquid water contents agree (LWCCZ, PLWCC, XRLWCC, PLWC6).
  1)  I've already explained LWCCZ.
  2)  XRLWC looks like it isn't sensing anything.
  3)  PLWC6 looks much too high.  I'm wondering whether we are using the
       correct cell sizes (for TOGA-COARE, too).

Static pressures differ by over 3 mbar.

Paul,

I found the problem.  The CEPEX header uses TTCF1 and TTCF2, but the rest of
GENPRO uses XTTCF1 and XTTCF2.  I had not changed them in GENPRO's input stage.
The next time I run a job they should be OK.

As we discussed earlier, PCORs for both sensors are being applied correctly.

Will you be giving me a new calibration for PSW?

When do you want to check maneuvers?  When were they?

Please let me know when you want me to make another run (also if you want
a different flight/time).

Paul,

No problem to implement old LWCC code.  I'm sure, for the PSW calibration,
that you want coefficients of 516.5777,

  Rest of mail messages from this date until 10:20 a.m. 10 June 1993 lost due
    to system failure.

Paul,

When the system crashed about 10:20 this morning, my CEPEX mail file got
clobbered.  Are you saving mail messages that we've been sending to each
other?  If so, how about bouncing to me all messages from 8 June to the
present.

To bounce a message, run 'elm' and use the cursor to select a message, type
'b'.  It will ask to whom you want to bounce the message (ron) after which it
will ask if you really want to bounce the message (y).  I think you'll have to
do this for each message.

Thanks a bunch.

Paul,

Following are my comments about yours:

> HI RON;Thanks for IDT on flt07.I have looked it over.Here are some comments:
> LWCC has - offset and neg spikes,can you doctor it up?

  I added a bias of 9.95 g/m3 to the instrument's calibration


> XRLWCC negative offset, can you   "    "    "    "  "?
 
  The CALIB function calculates power dissipated by the probe.  This is
   supposed to take care of any zero offset.  Would a change in wire
   temperature help?


> CONCA can you take a look at it,not getting counts,maybe instrument not 
> working?

  If you look at the statistical summary, there are a small number of counts
   in the time period I ran for you.  During TOGA-COARE there were a few
   time periods when that happened, too.  I think we should look at other
   data.  I'm doing things the same way for both projects.



> Allen promised more Ophir cal coef's tomorrow.

   I haven't seen them yet.  


> He thinks that a common one
> for T-C might work.If this is the case,we might use for CEPEX too.
> I have my doubts that such thing exist.Paul

  From what I've seen one set of coefficients don't even work during a whole
   flight.  There are many occasions when the temperature measurements diverge
   significantly enough to make the Ophir data suspect.

Paul,

I'm setting up a job having the changes we talked about yesterday (including
the use of CONC6 in place of CONCF in the calculation of LWCCZ).  I'll let you
know when the plot file comes back from the Cray so you can look at it.

I'm keeping LWCC, too, (with the calibration offset) so you can compare the
two results.

Paul,

CEPEX flight RF03 completed processing at about 6:30 this morning.  TAGS
finished doing the film processing at about 8:30.  I'm not sure when the film
will be ready, but it may or may not make it to you at noon.  If you do not
receive it, I'll try to find it and see whether you can get delivery later
this afternoon.

I looked through the log file and found that the whole-flight plot is missing
IRS True Heading (THI).  I changed the processor to include it for subsequent
runs.  It was trying to plot THF which doesn't exist.

HGM values are about half of HGME's looking at the statistics.  (There may
be things happening that mask the truth.)

Also XRLWCC will be consistently off scale with the fixed-scale plot being
used for TOGA-COARE.  For subsequent runs I could make it floating (with the
same range) if you want.

Allen & Paul,

I'm pleased to inform you that all the jobs I submitted to the Cray for both
of these projects have completed.  I'll be checking them during the day today
to see that all have been successful.  The volume of film produced by these
runs has swamped the film-room staff, so you will see few if any rolls in
today's noon mail with more of them filtering in throughout the week.  I hope
that meets with your schedule, too, since you have to review it all.

I got a call today from Andy Robertson (who manages the film room) stating that
microfilm is only processed (film developed and put on reels) between 8:00 a.m.
and midnight, Monday through Friday.  The weekend staffing levels are not
high enough to do 24hr/7-day processing.  He wanted to know whether we were
anticipating any more high-volume film-producing jobs.  How many copies of the
film do we need for the PIs?  It is possible to do it using TAGS?  Do we still
have our blanket order for film copying?

It looks like all of the CEPEX runs ran successfully to completion.  If the
microfilm looks OK, I guess we're done.

Paul,

I did a brief check of about 5 seconds each on CEPEX RF03 and RF07, and in both
cases it looked like the GPS corrections were working.  I'm not sure that is
the case for the whole flight, though.  If the plane ever goes beyond 60
degrees latitude or 100 degrees longitude from Hawaii (30., -125.), the GPS
corrections will stop working.  (The extremes would be lat: +90, -30;
lon: -225, -25.)  You can probably use the whole-flight microfilm plots to
determine that.

Paul,

I can make a brief check by looking at the log files for those flights (RF04
and RF08).  There is a "number of rejects" value that accumulates the number of
seconds that the GPS was ignored during the flight.  I suspect that all is OK.

I just checked the log files from RF04 and RF08.  Both had a low number of
"rejects."  That tells me that the code was not rejecting much of the GPS data.

Paul,

I would say so.  The only way to know for sure is to read all the data and look
at it.  I know that, unlike TOGA-COARE, the rejects were low.  If there is one
critical flight, I could bring the GENPRO file down to chinook, convert it to
a DAP file (using Xanadu) and plot some differences.

Ron;thanks for looking into it.The region we flew in CEPEX was directly south
of HI ~to -4deg S and east to longitude of 145deg.I think we should be in good
shape,don't you think?Do you want to check flts 4 and 8 if it is not too much
of a bother.Paul

This is not something that just slipped by.  I selected QCFC as the reference
based on missing QCRC data due to radome icing.  Unfortunately, the iced 
radome data were still lost due to some sort of buried test statement in the
GENPRO code.  We have used QCFC & QCRC interchangeably for many years.  If I
was not comfortable with this application - it wouldn't have been used in the
TC processing.  Detailed spectral analysis, which now seems neccessary, may
prove this to be an incorrect assumption and lead to reprocessing - but I 
doubt it.  I'll get back to you - take no new action at this time.
