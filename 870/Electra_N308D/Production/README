     This summary has been written to outline basic instrumentation
problems affecting the data set and is not intended to point out every
bit of questionable data.  It is hoped that this information will
facilitate use of the data as the research concentrates on specific
flights and times.

     The following report is organized into three sections.  The first
section lists recurring problems, general limitations, and
systematic biases in the standard RAF measurements.  The second
section lists isolated problems occurring on a flight-by-flight basis.
The third section provides information on the special RAF supplied
experimental instrumentation.

     Special pieces of both RAF- and User-supplied equipment were
used during the project and have been identified in the Research
Instrumentation list included in this document.  These data require
special handling, and it will be necessary to obtain access to the
on-board operator notes for this information to be of use during the
analysis phase.  No attempt has been made to evaluate the performance
of that equipment in this summary.

Section I:  General Discussion

     1.  The wind data for this project were derived from
measurements taken with the radome wind gust package.  As is the
case with all wind gust systems, the ambient wind calculations
can be adversely affected by either sharp changes in the
aircraft's flight attitude of excessive drift in the on-board
inertial reference system (IRS).  Turns, or more importantly,
climbing turns are particularly disruptive to this type of
measurement technique.  Wind data reported for these conditions
should be used with caution.

     Special sets of in-flight calibration maneuvers were conducted
on flights TF01 and RF45 to aid in the performance analysis of the
wind gust measurements.  The calibration data identified a
systematic bias in the sideslip parameter.  This offset, which
resulted in roughly a 10 - 15 degree error in calculated wind
direction, has been removed from the final netCDF data set.  All
of the remaining information, including the summary of IRS
performance, indicated that the wind measurement system was
performing within standard RAF specifications.  The time
intervals for each set of maneuvers have been documented in both
the flight-by-flight data quality review and on the individual
Research Flight Forms prepared for each flight.  

     As an additional enhancement to this data set, a second pass
correction was applied to the wind data using position updates
provided by the GPS positioning system.  Both the GPS-corrected
and uncorrected values are included in the final netCDF data set.


     2.  A Trimble Global Positioning System (GPS) was used as a
more accurate position reference during the program.  The
reliability of this system depends upon regional coverage by the
number of navigational satellites arrayed above the research
area.  Coverage over the local research area was generally good
during the program.  Generally, position (GLAT, GLON) and ground
speed (GSPD, GVEW, GVNS) were readily available, but occasional
dropouts did occur.  Such dropouts are easy to recognize and will
therefore not be specifically identified in the flight-by-flight
summary.


     3.  RAF flies redundant sensors to assure data quality.  
Performance characteristics differ from sensor to sensor with
certain units being more susceptible to various thermal and
dynamic effects than others.  Good comparisons were typically
obtained between the three standard temperatures (ATB, ATFH,
ATRF), three dynamic pressures (QCWC, QCRC, QCFC), two liquid
water sensors (PLWCC, XRLWCC), and the two dew pointers
(DPT, DPB).  Exceptions are noted in the flight-by-flight summary. 
Intermittent problems arose with the radome deicing system during
the project.  To provide the best continuity in the data set,
QCFC was selected as the reference dynamic pressure for most
of the flights. The differences observed in the static pressures
(PSFDC, PSWC) were somewhat excessive for this type of project
with the Model 1201 pressure transducer (PSWC) exhibiting even
more temperature sensitivity than normal.  The reference pressure
used in all of the derived parameters (PSFDC) was obtained with a
Model 1501 unit which was unaffected by these problems.  


     4.  Temperature measurements were made using the standard
heated (ATFH) and unheated (ATB) Rosemount and NCAR reverse-flow
(ATRF) temperature sensors along with one experimental
temperature sensor (OPHIR - OAT).  All of these standard
temperature sensors performed reasonably well, encountering the
usual problems with sensor wetting during cloud passes.  Both ATB
and ATRF also experienced a certain amount of radio frequency
interference (RFI) during FM broadcasts by the on-board mission
scientist.  ATFH remained unaffected by this problem.  A
comparison of the data sets yielded an good correlation in
instrument signatures and only small differences in absolute
value (+-0.2 oC) throughout the program.  A comparison of pre- and
post-program calibrations indicated that all units maintained
stable and independent calibrations.  Due to its reliability
under the icing conditions encountered on many of the flights and
the regular occurrence of RFI on the other sensors,  the heated
Rosemount temperature (ATFH) was selected as the reference value
used in calculating the derived parameters.  

     The experimental OPHIR-III temperature sensor functioned
adequately during the program but experienced numerous periods of 
unexplained drift.  This is a near-field, radiometric instrument
designed to avoid the complications related to sensor wetting or
icing that occurs during cloud passes.  These data have been
specially processed using flight-by-flight, clear-air calibration
adjustments derived from comparisons with the reference
temperature sensor.  However, the accuracy of these measurements
at any particular moment are clearly in question.  A careful
analysis of each cloud pass is recommended prior to use of these
data.  Additional baseline adjustments may be required for
specific cloud passes.  These data should not be used for any
clear air applications.  


     5.  Humidity measurements were made using two collocated
thermoelectric dew-point sensors, a Lyman-alpha fast-response
hygrometer, and the RAF Cryogenic Hygrometer.   Generally
speaking, all of the humidity sensors performed well when they
were available.  A series of hardware failures, however,
prevented the use of the Cryogenic hygrometer for a number of the
early flights.  

     The bottom EG&G dew pointer (DPB, DPBC) was much less
responsive during periods of large dew-point depression than the 
two-stage G.E. unit used in the top location.  A number of cases
occurred where DPB was essentially pegged out around -40 C when
the actual dew point was significantly lower.  Much of the fine-
scale humidity signature was also lost in DPB at the low dew
points.  Due to these factors, the top dew pointer (DPT,DPTC) was
selected as the reference sensor in calculating the derived
humidity parameters for most flights.  Near the end of the
program, the DPT showed a tendency to overshoot during sudden
changes.  For those flights, DPB was substituted into the
derived-variable calculations.

     Lyman-alpha hygrometers are susceptible to in-flight drift
in the instrument's bias voltage.  Due to this problem, RAF uses
a special data-processing technique to remove the bias drift by
referencing the long-term humidity values to one of the more-
stable thermoelectric dew point sensors.  This technique can
result in occasional large spikes in the derived Lyman-alpha data
(RHOLA) which often affect the auto-scaling features in the
plotting routines and wash out the plots.  Short (2-3 sec)
intervals around these spikes should be considered as bad
data, but the remaining data points, as recorded on magnetic
tape, will be valid.  For programs requiring routine cloud
penetrations, the rapid changes in humidity or wetting of the
sensor windows can trigger a reset of the coupling technique at
an inopportune time.  For the WISP 94 data processing, a broad
limit was therefore placed on the reference comparison.  During
the WISP 94 flight operations the Lyman-alpha hygrometer also
suffered periods of either severe in cloud sensor icing or
excessive drift during intervals of rapid altitude changes which
could not be compensated for by the special processing algorithm. 

     The RAF Cryogenic Hygrometer functioned well during the
program once the initial hardware problems were corrected.  The
unit is designed to only function a dew points below -15 C. 
There will often be short intervals where the unit attempts to
"lock on" to the dew point signal as this threshold is passed. 
At very low dew points (< -45 C), however, the cryogenic unit
maintains a much faster response time than the standard dew point
sensors and should be considered to be the most accurate of the
humidity measurements under those conditions.  Due to the varied
nature of the WISP 94 flight operations the unit was not turned
on for all flights.  Many of the relatively low altitude up-slope
cloud missions will not contain any Cryogenic data (DPCRC,
RHOCR).


     6.  A set of upward- and downward-facing radiometers were
used to measure shortwave and infrared irradiance.  It should be
noted that all units are hard-mounted, and that none of the data
have been corrected for changes in the aircraft's flight
attitude.  Care should be used in identifying the aircraft
attitude to determine a relative sun angle.  


     7.  The measurement of the surface temperature (RSTB) was
made using a Barnes PRT-5 sensor.  The measurements are typically
influenced by fluctuations in the reference cavity temperature
(TCAVB) and the contribution of water vapor in the sample volume
which is moisture-content and altitude dependent.  Overall, the
sensor performed extremely well.  However, the dynamic range of
the sensors is somewhat limited, and a specific operating range
had to be designated.  By targeting the instrument's range to the
expected surface temperatures (-20C to 30C), the unit's best
resolution was obtained.  However, due to the highly variable
nature of the surface conditions encountered and the flight
profiles through high altitude cold clouds, the unit's minimum
limit was exceeded on a number of occasions. 


     8.  Three types of alternate altimeter were used during the
program.  The Collins altimeter (HGM) is only functional from 0 -
780 m AGL.  At altitudes greater than 780 m the instrument is
pegged full scale.  The Stewart Warner altimeter (HGME), on the
other hand, is functional from 150 m to 21,000 m AGL.  At
altitudes less than 150 m the instrument's performance becomes
intermittent due to excessive signal refections off the surface. 
Care must be taken with HGME since the output will vary randomly
but look fairly realistic in this altitude region.  Differences
between HGME and the calculated pressure altitude (PALT) can be
attributed to either surface terrain features or the typical
differences between the surface pressure and the reference value
of 1013 mbar.  The default surface pressure and the NACA Standard
Atmospheric lapse-rate were used in the calculation of PALT in
order to provide an accurate comparison with similar computations
used for measurements taken by the other aircraft.  

     The GPS positioning system also provides an altitude readout
(GALT).  This output requires coverage by at least four
satellites for accurate measurements.  Due to the uncertainty in
satellite coverage, GALT defaults back to PALT values when the
fourth satellite is lost.  This results in periodic jumps in the
value of GALT.  In addition, the GALT signal has been "detuned"
by the military and exhibits an oscillation of +-100 m.  Due to
these problems, RAF has decided not to include GALT in the final
data set.


     9.  Three hot-wire liquid water sensors were used on the
Electra during the WISP 94 program.  The PMS King Probe (PLWCC)
worked extremely well during the program but experienced element
damage on several flights with subsequent replacement.  The RAF
Experimental King Probe (XRLWCC) is a modified version of the PMS
unit and is operated at a lower temperature.  This system also
worked well and avoided the element damage associated with PLWCC. 
A J-W system was also installed on the aircraft (LWCC).  The
sensing head was badly damaged early in the project during an
icing event and was not replaced due to a lack of spares.  None
of the J-W data appear in the final data set.  A comparison of
the other two units yielded a good correlation in instrument
signatures and only small differences in absolute value throughout
the program.  Special note should be made of the fact that
both these instruments are calibrated for a specific range of
aircraft speeds.  When the speed of the aircraft falls outside
that envelope, a shift in the zero baseline value will occur. 
This is typically limited to takeoff and landing intervals, but
there may be other situations where this occurs.  Considering
the better continuity in the RAF system's measurements (no
element replacements), XRLWCC should be used as the best source
of liquid water data.  

     Due to the nature of this sampling technique, it should be
clear that water contained in ice particles will not be observed. 
This fact should be taken into account when comparing data from
these sensors with the calculated liquid water content obtained
from the optical particle probes.


    10.  The RAF was responsible for the ozone and carbon
monoxide air chemistry measurements conducted on the Electra
during the program (TEO3C; CO).  Generally speaking, the two
units worked fairly well.  No problems were noted with the TECO
ozone analyzer, but there was little variation in ozone levels in
the project area during the field program.  The TECO carbon
monoxide analyzer typically exhibits a significant amount of
drift in its baseline zero and requires special data handling to
convert the data into engineering units.  During the WISP94
project, the unit also experienced intermittent intervals of
excessive noise and unexplained baseline jumps.  It was
decided that the data would only be output in a basic voltage
format.  A qualitative analysis is still possible.  Those Users
interested in actual concentrations should contact RAF for more
information.


    11.  The measurement of small CN size aerosol particle
concentrations can be influenced by two effects.  Droplet
shattering during cloud penetrations can increase indicated CN  
concentrations by several orders of magnitude.  For this
application the CN inlet was altered to a reverse flow
configuration.  This inlet format seems to have reduced this
problem significantly.  However, care should be used when
examining the quantitative values of CONCN during the cloud
passes.  The instrument uses Butanol to activate CN particles so
that they can be included in the measurement process.  Indicated
CN particle concentrations can decrease during intervals where
the Butanol level falls below the critical level.  This is
typically not a flight-to-flight concern as a fresh Butanol
supply will usually last for up to 50 hours of operation. 
However, scattered intervals of questionable data were noted
during the QA review and have been identified in flight summaries
of Section II.


   12.  Generally speaking, the five PMS particle probes (FSSP,
2D-C, 2D-P, PCASP, 260X) worked relatively well.  Due to the
instrumentation requirements for WISP 94, the Electra could only
be set up to handle four PMS probes at one time.  Some specific
details on each of the probes are summarized below:

          PCASP -  Aerosol concentrations measured with the PCASP
          probe are highly dependent upon the sample flow rate of
          the instrument.  Recent modifications to the probe/ADS
          interface now allow RAF to monitor fluctuations in this
          flow rate directly (PFLW).  During the WISP94 project
          the PCASP probe exhibited an unusual tendency to
          produce a great deal of noise that was altitude
          dependent.  The noise appears to be limited to the 
          smallest two or three size bins and increases with 
          increasing altitude.  This noise shows up as exceed-
          ingly high PCASP concentrations (CONCP).  Generally
          speaking, the size range of the CN counter is much
          broader than, but is inclusive of, the sampling range
          of the PCASP probe.  Therefore, intervals where CONCP 
          exceed the value of the CN concentrations (CONCN) will 
          be the result of this noise problem and not a true
          measure of the aerosol concentration.  RAF feels that
          the individual bin data should be examined for useful
          data at the higher bin sizes.  This problem remained
          unresolved over the term of the field program.

          FSSP -  The FSSP cloud droplet probe functioned
          extremely well throughout the entire project.  Like
          all 1-D optical probes, however, the FSSP has no way to
          distinguish between ice and water.  Therefore,
          the liquid water content calculated from this probe
          (PLWCF) should be used with caution in mixed-phase
          clouds.

          260X - The 260X precipitation probe has a tendency to
          be noisy in the first few bins when it is installed on
          the Electra.  There was little evidence of this problem
          during the WISP94 program.  Generally speaking,
          concentrations from the 260X and 2D-C probes were very
          well correlated.  However, sporadic spiking did occur
          during many of the cloud passes.  Care should therefore
          be used when interpreting these data.  Like the FSSP
          probe, the 260X has no way to distinguish between ice
          and water.  Therefore, the liquid water content
          calculated from this probe (PLWC6) should be used with
          caution in this application.

          2D-C/2D-P - Both of the two-dimensional imaging probes
          performed quite well throughout the program.  Due
          to the special nature of the 2D data set, only the
          digital computations of droplet concentrations have
          been included in the general data set.  The actual
          image data have been archived separately and will only
          be provided to Users on request.  Access to the images
          will require the use of specialized software routines
          that will necessitate direct assistance from the RAF
          staff.  Although we thought the probe was functioning
          well, it turned out that the 2D-C probe on the right
          wing tip was producing images that were being "squared
          off" by either a stuck byte or a swapped wire during
          flights RF01 - RF11.  General sizes and concentrations
          appear to be unaffected so only the "habit" shapes are
          in question.  The 2D-P probe was unaffected by this
          problem.

          2D-Greyscale - This is a modified version of the PMS
          2D-C probe, and the unit was installed on the Electra at
          the start of the program.  The unit worked perfectly on
          the ground, but experienced rapid degradation during 
          flight until the response was lost completely.  Due to
          the limited number of PMS mounting locations on the
          Electra, the unit was removed in favor of a standard
          2D-C unit.


   13.    The RAF Counterflow Virtual Impactor (CVI) was used to
impact and evaporate cloud droplets and ice particles during
flights RF01 - RF28 of WISP94.  Using this technique, condensed
water content and information about the residual nuclei of the
condensed phase particles was obtained.  Residual nuclei were
collected on filters for ice nuclei measurement, ion
chromatography, and electron microscopy.  The condensed water
content data should be very useful, since the CVI measures water
from supercooled and ice clouds as well as warm clouds.  However,
the CVI is one of the specialty instruments that require flight-
by-flight operator knowledge to interpret the data.  Please
contact Cynthia Twohy at RAF for more information on using these
data.


   14.  Incidents of aircraft icing can be easily detected by
examining the output of the Rosemount Icing Detector (RICE). 
Although may of the instruments on the aircraft are deiced, 
moderate icing of the instruments will significantly alter the
performance characteristics of all of the available instruments. 
Moderate icing levels were encountered on several flights.  Care
should be used when examining data from these intervals.


   15.  Data recording typically begins well in advance of the
actual aircraft takeoff time.  Virtually all measurements made on
the Electra require some sort of airspeed correction, or the
systems are simply not active while the aircraft remains on the
ground.  On many of the flights, a brief stop was made at the Ft.
Collins/Loveland airport to drop off aerosol samples.  Typically
the data recording was allowed to continue during these stops. 
None of the data collected while the aircraft is on the ground 
should be considered as valid.

resulted in numerous, short ferry flights to place the aircraft
into position for the primary storm missions.  Although data
were, in fact, collected during most of these flights, no attempt
