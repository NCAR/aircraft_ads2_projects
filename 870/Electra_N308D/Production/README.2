RF01 - RF02  Smith flow channel not set up correctly.  No offset.
             Problem corrected for RF03.  Use different cal factor
             for flts 1 & 2...C1=0.0

RF01 - RF11 2D-C probe on right wingtip: Although we thought 
            the probe was fuctioning well, it turns out that 
            the images were being "squared off" by either a stuck
            byte or a swapped wire.  General sizes and concentra-
            tions appear to be unaffected so only the "habit" 
            shapes are in question.  2D-P unaffected by problem.

RF01 - RF15 FMB, FMSB, FMST all pegging out at 10 vdc upon
            takeoff.  This is reasonable for the sensitive
            channels, but not FMB.  Made change to wiring 
            attachment of FMB following flight RF15.

RF02 - RF18 Use following cal coeffs. for VCRH:
          c1: 3.64; c2: 53.811; c3: 15.9131; c4: 1.91812

RF19 - RF45 Use following cal coeffs. for VCRH:
          c1: -105.0; c2: 16.508; c3: -2.46004; c4: 0.18571

RF07 - Changed flow meter on CVI F1 / new calibration factors
       installed in header - onboard.  Note for production
       processing.

RF11 - Many instruments iced up during the flight.  In particular
       ATB, FSSP sample tube, PCASP inlet, Cooper bulk inlet.

RF11 - RF15 Intermittent problem with carbon monoxide analyzer.
       Mostly works, step changes in baseline, to crashes in
       later flights.

RF13 - Swapped in CSU 2D-C probe for 2D-Grey which wasn't working
       anyway.  2D-C images now look good.

RF14 - Radome iced up some on flight.  Winds out for short
       portion.

RF15 - 2D-C mirrors iced up on ground.  Data bad for short
       interval, until heaters cleared up the problem.  Engine
       (#2) and nose gear problems developed during flight.  A/C
       grounded for repairs.

RF16 - Swapped in RAF 2D-C for CSU unit on port wingtip at
       recommendation of WISP investigators.  Moved 2D-P to right
       wingtip after repairing signal cable to fix original
       problem.  Swapped signal lines on field mills - now
       getting "most insensitive" data on FMB.  Data looked
       good in flight.  Hudson CCN counter installed for flight. 
       Worked - OK.  Replaced cryogenic hygrometer with
       Sabreliner unit.  Still some problems.  RAF CN counter
       developed a leak during flight.  Lost sample flow at
       altitude - data bad.  Some problems with carbon monoxide
       analyzer continue.  Possible icing problem? A very noisey
       signal.  Radome iced up some.  Heater intermittant.  WE'RE
       WORKING ON IT!.  
       Preparing cables, etc for Hallet cloud scope.  Should be
       ready soon.

RF18 - PLWCC element too sensitive to altitude changes... likely
       gain problem at end of flight.  Element changed prior to
       flight RF19.

RF20 - Entire ADS replaced between RF18 & RF19.  See different
       cal factor for VCRH.  Other cal adjustments likely due to
       new A to D converter.  Ran out of butenol on CN counter 
       about 2/3 rds thru the flight.  2-D airspeed clock left 
       at 10m/s from ground check for early part of flight.  Use
       std ADS data from TASF.  Changed PLWC element due to over
       sensitive response to airspeed changes.

RF22 - Problem with the CN counter from flight RF20 turned out
       not to be low butenol.  Loss of counting sensitivity with
       altitude on this flight.  Flows & pressure looked good. 
       Checked interrnal plumbing following the flight.  No
       obvious problem, but replaced internal tubing & checked
       integrety of exhaust dump. Problem turned out to be caused
       by new digital counter card we used to replace the card
       damaged in ADS burnout.  CN counts for RR20-RF22 are
       questionable.

RF23 - CN response good up to 21,000 ft.  Then abnormally high
       counts.  Possible leak at MAX cabin pressure differential.

RF24 - Removed piece of inlet tubing closest to CN counter. 
       Slight scoring of hose appears to have been the cause of
       the problem.  No more high altitude problems with CN.
       Good comparison between CN and CVI CN concentrations when
       later placed in ambient sample mode.


RF27/28 Heavy icing incidents affected many of the instruments.
        PLWCC, LWCC, VCRH, L@, XRLWCC, 2D-C.

RF29   CN pump inadvertently left OFF for this ferry leg from
       FT Collins to Stapleton.

RF30 - Deicing required so all PMS optics cleaned after this
       flight.  PLWCC element bent during icing incident so it
       was replaced prior to next flight. CVI inlet replaced with
       Yale ice stick for the rest of the project.  Changed inlet
       orientation on the Wyoming CCN inlet.  Now aft facing to 
       avoid icing.

RF40   Wyoming CCN inlet changed back to forward facing for 
       remaining flights.

Special note: OPHIR-III data processing will need some flight-to-
flight adjustments to A1,A2, & ophir.names. RF28 - XXXX use
A1=-6.1558e-5 ; A2=2.0565e-6 ; OTBBC = 501.0 ; OTBBF = 501.0.
