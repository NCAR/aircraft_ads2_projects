Ron: I currently have Julie making copies of all the WISP94 tapes.
	She should be done in a few days and I will gladly turn the master
	set over to you, at that time.  I have start/stop times and
	will ask Julie to record file sizes as she makes her copies.

Allen,

If you have any master WISP ADS tapes you are not presently using, it
would make sense for me to archive them to the Mass Store.  This procedure
typically takes less than 3 working days, so you could have them back here
rather quickly.  Once they are archived to the MSS, theoretically, you never
need to mount them again, because you can easily retrieve them from the MSS.
(I have just written a script to make that task trivial, but you need a MIGS
account.)

It would help me immensely, if you can give me the following information about
each tape:  flight date, start time, end time, file size and number of records.
(I only require the flight number, which should be on each tape.)

Yes, it would probably be a good idea to see what sort of problem they
are having with the GPS corrected winds.  Might be enlightening!  I only
need about 1/2 an hour of data.  I believe the time period in question was
1030 to 1100 . Thanks

Allen,

Is Julie going to handle NIMBUS processing for WISP94?  Will you be involved
at all?  Any idea when you or she plan to begin?

Do you still want me to convert the TexMex RF05 (10:00-12:00) high-rate data
to a DAP file?  I've got the GENPRO file here, but I have not had a chance
to do anything with it.

As you surmised - the units on XCFACT should be "none".  The use of "N"
in other unit designations should, in fact, be replaced by "cnts".

Allen,

The following variables (output to the file 870rf18.cdf) are "Unknown";
I don't know whether you want all of them output either, since some of
them are rather uncommon (e.g., V28).  I'm amazed at how many there are.

adding them later today or tomorrow.
--------
GMODE

I know these variables are event marks, but I'm not familiar with the codes.
How about giving me a long "Title" to go with each of them.

Allen,

One of the variables in this project is XCFACT (CVI Concentration Correction
Factor).  Is this a unitless variable; if so, then its "Units" should be
"none."

A number of other variables have the "Units" of "N."  If these are counts,
then we normally use "cnts."

Allen,

I think it would be a good idea to set up NIMBUS now for all the high-rate
processing.  The main tasks would be determining the output variables and
specifying the derived variable's rates.  I think it would be easier for
you to do this now while the project is still relatively fresh in your mind.

Also, I think we should process "all" the variables (instead of a
user-specified list) to save the possibility of having to reprocess
due to a "missed" variable that a user later finds out s/he needs.

What are your thoughts?

Allen,

The user-specified list has nothing to do with your WISP setup.  I was
referring to something about which you are probably not aware.  This month,
Krista undertook a task to provide high-rate 4-270 data to an outside user.
She set up a NIMBUS processor to output only 13 variables (other than time).
I frown on this kind of user customization, because, too often, it leads to
us having to redo the processing later and add the forgotten, but needed,
variables.

Concerning WISP, I'm sure that the variable list you have chosen for the
low-rate data set will be just fine for the high-rate.  For you, the main
task will be selecting rates for the derived variables, and, of course,
saving the setup for later.  If only rates are changed, you can save the
setup in the same file, because NIMBUS always defaults to low-rate
processing (unless you selected sample-rate output for some variables).

In short, we're on the same page.

I have no objection to setting up the HRT options but I don't know what you
mean by "User-specified list".  Any variables deleted were selected by me 
and are not relavent to the overall data set.  If you disagree, please

Allen,

What's the status of NIMBUS production processing for WISP?

If you need help running production jobs, I think Brenda Martinez may be
able to help you.  I'm not sure of her late spring/summer schedule, so I
cannot promise anything, but she did a good job for Krista and me with some
special processing for 4-270.  She is a replacement for Joel, so, according
to Dick, data management is her first priority.

Allen,

If you have NIMBUS ready to go (i.e., you have all the `FlightXX' files and
the `FlightGroups' file set up), then Brenda should have an easy time of it.
I found out that she will be back either Thursday or Friday.  Perhaps we can
get together with her then to see how she can help you.

Did you get a chance to do the high-rate setup, too?  If you're hurting for
time, perhaps I could help you with that.

In the meantime, do we have anything else to talk about ourselves?

Ron:  I'm not quite to that stage yet.  I was just in the process of setting
	up the 'FlightXX' and 'FlightGroups' files when I got really busy.
	Not counting the fact that I've forgotten the specific procedures for
	setting up these files.  If you could give me a hand it would save
	me the time required flailing around getting reaquainted with the
	system.

Rachel,

I remember us discussing your development of software that would read
the netCDF files we are creating of the WISP-94 data.  At that time
I mentioned that you would be getting high-rate data.  As it turns out,
this is only partially true.  The complete data set (all times for all
flights) will be generated as low-rate data (all samples at 1 per second).

Later on, Roy and others will give us some specific time periods, and
we will create high-rate data sets for them.

Since the high-rate data is a netCDF expansion of the low-rate data set, 
I would think you should be able to handle both without a lot of grief.
However, I thought I'd let you know in case you are planning only for
a high-rate data set.

Since I gave you a MSS path for sample high-rate data, here is the
equivalent path for a sample low-rate data set.  You may want to try
out your software with bitfiles in this directory:

         /RAF/1994/853/LRT

The bitfiles will be of the form `fltno.cdf,' where `fltno' is RF01 - RF09
(e.g., RF04.cdf).

I anticipate having some processed WISP-94, low-rate, netCDF files in about
a week or so.  (I'll let you know.)

Brenda,

I just discovered that you may have a problem retrieving the files (listed
below) from the MSS to process WISP data.  The reason is that MIGS supposedly
has a 200Mbyte limit on the file size that can be transferred.  These files
are all larger than that.  If they fail to transfer via MIGS, I will have to
bring them down for you via ftp.  So, I suggest you omit trying to retrieve
these data sets until I find out the real limit, now that I know you
successfully retrieved RF11.

I also will try to make RF30 a single bitfile on the MSS.  The tape will go
to the Mesa Lab in the noon mail.  Hopefully, by Monday that data will be
available.

Brenda,

It turns out that the REAL maximum file size for MIGS is 209,715,200
bytes, so RF11 just made it under the wire.  With that in mind, let's
process the big files last.  For one, we must remove a bunch of the
little files for one to fit, and it will take awhile to bring one of
them down (though I'm not sure if that will be a problem, now that the
TLS is working).

One thing I learned from Greg Woods today is that it is better to submit
these MIGS jobs sequentially rather than all at once (i.e., wait for a
file to arrive before requesting another).  Each file is first transferred
from the MSS to the NCAR MIGS server and then copied down here.  That server
has only 2.4Gbytes of scratch space for all MIGS users, so we can easily eat
up a lot of that space all by ourselves.

Rachel,

I just put a preliminary low-rate netCDF data set from WISP-94 on the 
MSS as the file:  /RAF/1994/870/PRELIMINARY/LRT/RF31.cdf.  Most likely
this is the final, production version, but don't count on it.  Any change
in the variable list will minor (add/delete one or two variables).  The
basic netCDF format won't change.

As I may have indicated before, the path names for the production output
data sets will be:
  Low-rate:   /RAF/1994/870/LRT/RF##.cdf
  High-rate:  /RAF/1994/870/HRT/RF##.cdf
    where ## is the flight number.

Following is a list of the data with dates and approximate times.  I will
give you a revised list when we have completed the processing.

Ben,

Last week I gave Rachel Ames the name of a preliminary Mass Store netCDF
processed WISP Electra data set for her to play with.

Since we are now dumping out production data for WISP, we have the final
variable list you had asked for.  The easiest way for me to get that is
to dump the netCDF header from one of these data sets.  Having done that,
I discovered it is too large (60382 bytes) to send via email.  Therefore,
I have made it available to you via anonymous ftp to `chinook.atd.ucar.edu.'
The file to get is `870RF02.header.'

Let me know when you have retrieved it, so I can purge it from our system
and recover the disk space.

Ron,

Thanks.  I tried to get it by anonymous ftp, but could not
find the file in the directory I was automatically put in.
What directory is that file on?

Allen,

Brenda has finished production processing of the WISP-94 data including
the two-piece (concatenated) RF30.  (I have not yet been able to stage
RF30 with all the data in a single MSS bitfile.  SCD is working on the
situation, since the resulting file should be less than 400Mbytes.)

I imagine you want to peruse selected flights to make sure that your
unique setups were working properly and that all the data seem reasonable.

I will soon (probably tomorrow) make up a taplog file for this project.
Please let me know when you want me to archive all the data.

Had a chance to review my new processing procedures draft yet?  :)

Allen,

Following is the output from my latest script which automatically generates
a `taplog.proj#' file.  It read the netCDF headers for all the production
output data files in the .../staticdata directory.

As I told you, RF39 has two segments.  I'm not sure of the reason, but it
was not the flight that had two input data files concatenated together (RF30).

This file is easily regenerated if you need to reprocess RF39.

Allen,

I ran NIMBUS on RF39 and was able to generate the production data set
without a time gap.  Out of curiousity, I retrieved the RF39 ADS data
from the MSS this morning and ran that file through NIMBUS, too.  Both
tries produced a file without time gaps.  I'm not sure why Brenda's run
had a problem.

As a matter of procedure, I suggest that if unexpected time gaps are created
when processing a data set:
  1)  one should rerun the data again using the same file; 
  2)  if it produces the same gap, retrieve a new ADS data copy from the MSS
       and run it a third time;
  3)  if that fails, run it using the master ExaByte tape.
Once we gain experience with this type of failure mode, it may be prudent to
eliminate some of these tries.

Bob,

You can obtain the 3 files from WISP-94 that you requested (RF32, RF37
and RF44) via anonymous ftp to chinook.atd.ucar.edu.  The files you want
are in the pub/wisp directory named 870RF32.cdf, 870RF37.cdf and 870RF44.cdf.

If you have never used anonymous ftp before, follow the example below. 
(Things you type have been displaced to the right for clarity.)
It helps to have changed to the destination directory before you begin.
If you haven't done that, you can use ftp's `lcd <dirname>' command to
change the local directory to <dirname>.
If you want your local file name to be different from the source,
add it to the end of the get command (e.g., get 870RF32.cdf myname).

Brenda,

Just thought I'd give you an update.

The ExaByte tape for RF30 arrived at the Mesa Lab just after noon.  Earlier
this afternoon I submitted a job to have that tape staged to the Mass Store
as a single bitfile.  I'll let you know when and if that was successful.
In the meantime you may procee with processing the other flights.  I see you
are up to RF35.  Things are looking good.

P.S.  Did you notice that you slightly misnamed 870RF32?

Brenda,

Last night I tried to stage the entire flight RF30 to one MSS bitfile,
since it is less than 400Mbytes, but it failed again with an "file too
large" message.  I sent the failure messages to SCD to see if they have
some kind of bug in their software.

To keep from holding you up, I suppose we could try to bring down the two
pieces of RF30 that are on the MSS right now and try concatenating them
together.  I'm curious to see if that will work anyway, because we have
a number of flights from other projects on the MSS that are split that
way.

I see you are making good progress.  Thanks for all the help!

Just a reminder that when you have the summary written up for WISP-94, please
put it in the WISP Production directory in a file called README.

Are you comfortable enough with the netCDF files for me to archive them?

Any idea when you will finish things up?

Allen,

For the 4-870 WISP high-rate setup of the 260X and FSSP probes:  should we
output data at 10sps or 1sps?

Please note, that, unlike GENPRO, any high-rate derived output from these
probes are at 25sps no matter what the input rate.  So things like FSSP
concentrations from the 10 sps data still are output at 25 sps.  It would
be nice to see this changed to something more consistent with the input.

Yes,  the std King Probe and Ophir are the only variables affected.  I 
recommend that they hold off for the rerun.  It should not significantly
delay the distribution of the "official" data set.  All project documentation
should be complete by the end of next week.  We should be able to reprocess
by that time... and they distribute.

Rachel,

I am in the process of archiving all the WISP-94 LRT data to the SCD Mass
Store System (I'm up to RF24 at this writing).  The MSS path is
/RAF/1994/870/LRT/fltno, where fltno is the flight number.  A number of
support files will appear in that directory in the future, most of them
information files for RAF; some of them may also have general interest.
Below is the Mass Store Bitfile Log listing all the flight data that will
ultimately appear in the path.

Allen,

I have archived to the MSS all the WISP-94 netCDF files.  I still have
to archive all the ancillary files.  It only took about 4.5 hours of
wall-clock time.  The actual data transfer was much faster, but it took
sometimes over 5 minutes for the MSS to be ready to receive a file.

Allen,

I spoke with Chris about this issue.  It is fine for Brenda to begin bringing
down the ADS files and rerun everything for us if she has the time.  We can
purge all the data sets from `staticdata,' since they are already on the MSS.

I need to tell the WISP people that the data sets on the MSS have problems
with the King Liquid Water and Ophir.  Are these the only variables changed
via the `Defaults' file?  Would you rather they not use them at all?

I just thought I'd let you know that on 29 July 1994 I replaced all the
WISP output LRT netCDF files on the SCD Mass Store System (MSS) with new
ones.

There were problems with the data for certain flights, so RAF regenerated
all of them.  It appears that these are now the definitive output data sets
for this project.  I don't think the format has changed, just the data
content.

If you have questions about the differences between old and new, please
contact Allen Schanot (allen@chinook.atd.ucar.edu, ext. 1036).

I am now in the process of archiving all the support files used for
creating these data sets.

I know you are probably interested in a preliminary HRT data set, but I
haven't been able to generate one yet.  Perhaps in the next week or two.

 Ron:

We had both an icing problem and RFI problem with ATB & ATRF.  If we get
a request for HRT data from WISP we need to switch the reference temp to
ATB and aknowledge the fact that there will be significant intervals
that will be effected by these problems.  It makes no sense to me to 
produce an HRT data set with a 1 Hz temp measurement.  We should be all
right with this since the HRT set will not be placed in general distribution.

Chris,

Which file path should I use to archive the NIMBUS processor used for
WISP on chinook?  Is it still chinook:/home/local/nimbus?

Hi Ron,	
	Just thought I'd let you know that the Feb 7th
dataset (flight RF10) only gues to 20:57:04 instead of 20:57:07 like
the header says.  
	Also, I'd like to verify that the GPS was used
for the entire program.  We are computing our xdist and ydist
from the GPS.
	Everything seems to be going well so far.  Thanks.
	Oh, I'd also be interested in the Genpor to netCDF 
format converter.  No rush, I guess I'd like to have it around
in case it comes in handy sometime.  I talked with Glenn
Gordon and he mentioned that you had something like this.
Thanks again.

Hi Ron,
	we found two more flights with inconsistant times.  The
March 6th flight ends at 19:47:20 instead of 19:47:27.  The Feb 8th 
flight ends at 21:07:56 instead of 21:08:03.  Please let me know if this 
is a problem with the way I'm converting the data to Genpro.
	About the GPS.  I'll assume it was used the whole project.
Thanks.

Bob,

I was looking at my "requests" email file and discovered that I had given
you WISP data.  The message doesn't say whether the data were raw ADS or
processed.  If the files were NIMBUS netCDF, the data you received were
preliminary.  Therefore, I just wanted to let you know that RAF has now
completed the production processing all the NIMBUS netCDF files for 4-870
WISP.  A problem was found for certain variables in the preliminary NIMBUS
processing for certain flights.  Allen Schanot (allen@chinook.atd.ucar.edu)
has details on what flights and what changes to expect.

If you want new copies of the netCDF data files, please give me your
request.  I don't have a list of what you previously received, so please
be specific.  (The raw ADS data files, of course, have not changed.)

Bob,

After I sent you my email, I found all my old messages, too.  But thanks
for helping me refresh my memory.

I just spoke with Al Schanot about why these data were reprocessed.
  1)  For all flights, the baseline offset for PLWCC (King Liquid Water
      Content) was corrected.
  2)  For RF44 (and some other flights that you did not receive) the
      reference airspeed sensor was changed to QCF, because the standard
      reference (QCR) had problems and made bad measurements from 17:51
      to 18:18 and from 18:22 to 20:25.  The derived variables using true
      airspeed as a reference (directly or indirectly) are:
       a) Reference true airspeed (TASX)
       b) Attack and sideslip angles (AKRD, SSRD)
       c) Winds (UI, VI, WI, UX, VY, XUC, XVC, XWC, XUXC, XVYC)
       d) Ambient (static air) temperatures (ATB, ATFH and ATRF)
       e) Cryogenic dew point (DPCRC)
       f) Relative humidity, absolute humidity and mixing ratio from
           hygrometers (RHUM, RHODT, RHOLA, RHOLA1, MRLA and MRLA1)
       g) Potential temperatures (THETA, THETAE and THETAV)
       h) PMS particle probe concentrations (C260X_WDL, CFSSP_IBL, CON2C1
           and CON2P1)
       i) Corrected liquid water contents (LWCC, PLWCC and XRLWCC)
       j) CVI Measurements (XCVCNO, XCFACT, XCVS4 and XCVS7)
       k) Calculated surface pressure (PSURF)
      Some of these measurements are minimally affected because of the
       minor influence of true airspeed on the derived calulation.

If any of these measurements are critical to your research, I suggest you
get the new data; these are the final production data sets.  I have put
copies of the netCDF files in the same place as before (anonymous ftp -->
chinook.atd.ucar.edu):  pub/wisp directory with names 870RF32.cdf,
870RF37.cdf and 870RF44.cdf.

Again, when you have no more need for them, please let me know so I can
release the disk space.

Hi Ron,

Thanks for the info.  I noted you didn't list the total FSSP concentration
CONCF_IBL.  Is this affected too?  

We will begin transfering the NETCDF files.  I'll let you know when we're
done.

Bob,
   My mistake.  CONCF_IBL is derived from CFSSP_IBL which uses TASX, so it
will be affected along with DBARF_IBL, DISPF_IBL and PLWCF_IBL.

>

   That is correct.  However, I made one mistake; our normal reference, QCF,
was switched to QCR, not the other way around.  Also, the true airspeed
measurements in your original data set is affected only during the time
periods I sent you, so all are not bogus.
   RF32 and RF37 only had the PLWCC offset removed.

   Just to be safe, I will cc this email to Al Schanot for verification,
since he set up the processing.  If he contradicts anything I've written,
I'll have him get back to you.  (I would ask him directly, but he is
presently in a meeting.)

Bob,

The final, production, low-rate (1sps), NIMBUS netCDF data sets for the
4-870 WISP project are now ready.  Soon you will be getting a copy of RAF's
3-ring binder giving you detailed information about this project.  The
data have been archived on the NCAR/SCD Mass Store System (MSS) in the MSS
directory `/RAF/1994/870/LRT/fltno,' where "fltno" is the flight number.
(A complete listing follows this message.)

Do you want your own copies of the data on magnetic tape?  We can make
copies of the data on either 1/2" reels or ExaByte cartridges and send them

Ron,

The final, production, low-rate (1sps), NIMBUS netCDF data sets for the
4-870 WISP project are now ready.  Soon you will be getting a copy of RAF's
3-ring binder giving you detailed information about this project.  The
data have been archived on the NCAR/SCD Mass Store System (MSS) in the MSS
directory `/RAF/1994/870/LRT/fltno,' where "fltno" is the flight number.
(A complete listing follows this message.)

Do you want your own copies of the data on magnetic tape?  We can make
copies of the data on either 1/2" reels or ExaByte cartridges and send them
to you, or you may freely access the MSS data.  If you would like your own
copies, please let me know.

Allen,

Back in late June we made 3 WISP netCDF data sets available to Bob Rauber
(RF32, RF37, RF44).  Since then we have reprocessed all the flights.
Discovering this yesterday, I thought it important to tell Bob about it,
since he obviously got the earlier data.

>From his email reply:  "Can you let me know whether I've got the final
datasets.  Tomorrow, we are preparing final figures for a proposal and
paper so I need to know soon.  Thanks,   Bob"

Do you know whether the 3 data sets he received are OK, or should he get
new ones?

Allen,

I'm working on setting up the NIMBUS processor for WISP's high-rate
processing, and I just noticed that the reference temperature sensor
for WISP was ATFH.  It was sampled at only 5sps, so its nominal output
rate for HRT would be 1sps.

Was this sensor chosen as the reference because the icing conditions
affected the non-deiced Rosemount (ATB)?

For the high-rate setup, should I output ATX at 25sps and ATFH at 1sps
(even though they are the same data)?

If RAP wants to compute fluxes, I think they will run into differential
phase problems due to the different filter cutoff frequencies.  It seems
to me that we are compromising ourselves by using a low-rate sensor for
high-rate turbulence data.  Perhaps, under the conditions, it is the
best we can do.

Allen,

I have created a NIMBUS setup file called "HRT.convert" which, I hope, can
be used as a generic converter for all the extant Flight_xx files.  The idea
is that one brings up a flight for processing the normal way, but before one
"GO"es, load this special setup file to convert everything to "high-rate."

I asked Chris a question about this file, but I haven't gotten his reply
yet.  I know it is OK for RF42 (my template), but I won't know whether it
is truly generic until I hear back from him.

It would be nice if we could have an easy way to do these high-rate
conversions.

Anyway, when I get something concrete, I'd like you to look over the
variables and verify (nullify?) the rates I've chosen for them.  I'll
let you know when I have something definite.

Ron,

The final, production, low-rate (1sps), NIMBUS netCDF data sets for the
4-870 WISP project are now ready.  Soon you will be getting a copy of RAF's
3-ring binder giving you detailed information about this project.  The
data have been archived on the NCAR/SCD Mass Store System (MSS) in the MSS
directory `/RAF/1994/870/LRT/fltno,' where "fltno" is the flight number.
(A complete listing follows this message.)

Do you want your own copies of the data on magnetic tape?  We can make
copies of the data on either 1/2" reels or ExaByte cartridges and send them
to you, or you may freely access the MSS data.  Please let me know whether
or not you would like your own copies.

Al-

    I retrieved the WISP-CIP NetCDF data files from the Mass Storage
System already.  So there's no need to have a tape sent to us.  After
looking at the data, I found that FPCRC and DPCRC are the same value
for all the flights.  That is the cryogenic frost point temperature
and the cryogenic dew point temperature is the same!  I couldn't find
in the documentation you sent us, what the difference between the two
variables is, or if there SHOULD be a difference.  Could you shed a
little light on this for me?  Normally the frost point does not equal
the dew point temperature!

                     Thanks in advance for your help,

Paul,

Thanks to your query, we discovered that both FPCRC and DPCRC are being
calculated (by mistake) with the same algorithm.  Both are producing a
Dew Point (whereas FPCRC should be producing a Frost Point).  In the next
revision of our processing software, we will correct this mistake.

Please let me know whether a Frost Point calculation is important to you.
One can convert from one measurement to the other by using known vapor
pressure differences between water and ice.

I can send you some code that should work for you.  Would you like it in
c or FORTRAN?

Paul,

Here's the procedure (and this will work with ANY dew point measurement
below 0C, not just the cryogenic hygrometer).
    1)  With measured dew point, calculate vapor pressure over a plane
         water surface using the Goff-Gratch formula.
    2)  Use Newton's method to extrapolate the frost point with the
         Goff-Gratch formula for vapor pressure over a plane ice surface
         (the result of the first calculation).
    3)  Here is the appropriate FORTRAN code:

C
C   FORTRAN CODE STARTS HERE
C
      E = VAPOR(your dew point goes here)
      FP = FPT(E)

C     where   E = vapor pressure (mbar) from your dew point temperature (C)

Ron,

I've got the three Bob Rauber tar tapes in the mail, but they won't get picked
up until tomorrow(Wednesday) AM.  You're log copy is in the NCAR mail.  Let
me know if you have any last minute suggestions or amendments and I'll pull the
tape package out of the mail slot.

Allen & Barb,

I have contacted the 5 persons, designated to receive NIMBUS production
data, to assess their needs for magnetic tape.  Here are the results:
     Roy Rasmussen:  no need for tapes -- can access data from the MSS
     Al Cooper:      no need for tapes -- can access data from the MSS
     Ron Smith:      no need for tapes -- have already retrived the entire
                      data set from the MSS
     Bob Rauber:     shipped three high-density ExaByte tapes (in tar
                      format) containing the entire data set.
     Jim Hudson:     shipped one low-density ExaByte tape (in tar format)
                      of the data which interested him (RF16 through RF45).

So far as I know, this completes the primary processing for WISP-94.

Marcia,
  Here is the list of dates and times for which Fikrettin Celik would like
high rate Electra data.

This first flight is of high priority for him.  He is currently looking
at this case and would like the data as soon as possible.  He would
appreciate it if you could give me some indication of how long it will
take to get this one.

940306 124809-194727

The rest of these flights are cases he will be looking at but are not
as urgent at this time.  The order is the priority he gave me.

Dick and Allen,

Following is a formal request I received yesterday for high-rate WISP-94
processing.  Larry Oolman called me earlier in the day, and I referred him
to Roy Rasmussen.  Roy subsequently deferred to Marcia.  What priority
should I give this task?  Larry indicated that there was one flight that
he'd like to get right away.  Once I get things set up, the processing
becomes one of disk space management more than my time.  I think I should
get on it soon.

Ron: We will probably start getting more of these requests for HRT data
	from WISP-94.  I think it should be a high priority for you to
	get the HRT processing set up so we can respond quickly.  What
	gets pushed back in the Q if you switch over to this?

Ron:
     I agree that the WISP processing should have a high priortiy. Lets 
make sure that this is well coordinated so that we don't get conflicting
or overlapping requests from differnt wisp investigators. All of the wisp
investigators should be notified which high rate data sets have been requested
and are being processed. This is something that you and Allen should work
out with Rassmussen or Politovich (maybe you already have).
     Let's make it official that you (and Barbara?) will be the keepers of the
Mosaic infrastructure at RAF. There is a possiblity that Rob may be staying
on and his expertise would be available to us but that is yet to be 
determined. I cannot speak for Barbara but there is a proposal that she be
involved with Mosaic along with you.
   On another subject. I notice that there are still a number of variables
in the nimbus that do not have units associated with them. Who is keeping track 
and updating the list? It seems that this should be an easy thing to keep on
top of and it is a bit awkward when the PI is looking over your shoulder
and an obvious variable has a unit of unknown. Is there one place where this
is set for both winds and nimbus or are chris and gary still trying to 
resolve it? Please look into this.

I have been setting up the HRT processor for WISP.  It is almost ready for
a test run.

I have not discussed the request with Allen yet (other than via email), but
I plan to talk to him about this request.  I know that it resulted only from
me referring Larry Oolman (UW) to Roy Rasmussen when he asked me for high-
rate data.  I'm not sure what plans Rasmussen/Polotivich have.  I agree with
you that we should try to get a single request from them for all the data
they desire.  That may be difficult, especially since Oolman wants some of
the data quickly.  With Allen, I'll pursue this tack.

OK.  I've already gotten some Mosaic information from Rob.

I have been making all the additions to the master variable dictionary for
nimbus (VarDB).  Basically, I've been adding definitions when asked by Allen
or others, or when I am setting a project up for production and notice
missing variables that will be output to the production data set.  In the
latter case, it does mean that the variable has not been defined during
the in-field phase.

I'm not sure of the status of WINDS; Gary was to switch loyalties from the
Bulletin9 file to VarDB, but I don't know if that has happened yet.  (I'll
find out.)  One way to get you variable definitions in the field is to have
Xbuild force a user to give a definition for any new variable a user is
trying to add.  That may backfire if we have to change it later.  I really
think we need to have some mechanism in place for adding new variable names
as well as their definitions.  I'll get together with Allen on this, too,
and see if we can get all the RAF-known variables into the official list.

Allen,

I don't have anything critically pressing other than preparation for the
RDP retreat coming up next week.

In addition to my normal tasks, I planned to start revising Bulletin 9
and take over the RAF Mosaic webmaster job from Rob.  I have not been
officially assigned the latter task, but I don't know who would do that
after he left.  I think someone should pick his brain before he departs
in a couple weeks.

I'm still making some revisions to the GENPRO-to-netCDF converter program
as a background task.  (I haven't released any newly-changed version from
the one I announced a while back.)

Following is the email I propose to send to Roy Rasmussen and Marcia

Roy and Marcia,

You recently forwarded to me a request for high-rate data from Larry Oolman
(University of Wyoming).  I am presently setting up the high-rate NIMBUS
processing software to provide these data.  They should be ready soon.

It is most efficient for RAF to process a "complete" high-rate data set,
because it saves us from dealing with many obscure data requests that are
likely to trickle in, each one having to be handled separately.

I don't mean to impose, but, would it be possible for you to poll all
your colleagues and create a complete list of flight dates/times for
the high-rate data everyone needs?  Upon receipt, we would then process
and archive this "complete" data set which you could all share.

 Ron:  I guess I have a problem with the use of the word "complete".  A
	complete data set implies ALL.  How about a comprehensive high rate
	data set covering the needs of the Users.  As PI's, we would like
	them to develop a list of key data which would then be handled in
	one shot.  Additional requests could still be handled in certain
	limited conditions, but would have a low priority for RAF response.

	I liked the "efficient" part and the idea of a one shot processing
	covering 98% of requests.  Many times Users won't always know
	what flights are good for a particular research topic until they
	"fall" over them.  So I don't think we can totally void out any
	future requests.... just make them a pain.

Roy,

The WPSP-94 binder-packet information for the PMS-260X cell size is
incorrect in the Research Instrumentation and distorted in the Calibration
Summary sections.  The true size range is 20-620 um (According to Darrel
Baungardner, useful from 40-620 um).

Marcia,

Since I sent you that email, RAF has reprocessed RF26.  The FSSP data, to
be output at 10 samples per second (sps), inadvertently was output at 1 sps
instead.  Yesterday, the MSS had a problem when I tried to archive that
new data.  I am presently trying it again and will let you know when it is
ready.

Larry requested an ExaByte tape of the data, so RDP will soon prepare one
for him.

Marcia and Roy,

The data for RF26 and RF28 are now available on the Mass Store.  Their
bitfile names are:
   /RAF/1994/870/HRT/RF26.cdf
   /RAF/1994/870/HRT/RF28.cdf

Here are the pertinent details:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will send another message after all the requested flights are ready.
I'm sending this series of messages only because of the urgency for RF26.

Ron - here is the "quick and dirty" answer.

For that first flight date I sent, let's do the
"critical" processing - without the 1D data, in 
other words, 1-hz 1D data with 10-hz other dat.  
I know Fikretten (the student who's in a a hurry)
doesn't need it. 

FOr the others, I think we can wait till early Jan.
when you get the new NIMBUS processor, and decide
what temperature probe to use. I'll pass your note
on to Larry and others and see whether they agree.
Usually Christmas schedules are so mixed up that 
it probably won't matter (although you know how 
students are -- Fikretten will likely use the time
to work work work!)

Done.  It turns out there was a core file in one of the amlib directories,

Chris,

I have finished high-rate NIMBUS production processing for all the requested
files for 4-870 WISP.  I have four more tasks before I'm truly finished:
 - archive the NIMBUS processor (tar file) to the Mass Store;
 - archive the NIMBUS support files to the Mass Store;
 - archive HRT/RF09 to the Mass Store;
 - modify the netCDF files to fix the FSSP data according to Darrel's wishes.
I plan to do the first three tomorrow.  I just put a tar file of the present
NIMBUS processor (/home/local/nimbus) in the proj/870/Production directory.
It's up to 4.1 Mbytes now.  I guess you can make a new release if you want.

I'll have to talk with Darrel (and you) about the skeleton program.

Chris,

If you want to do a "make clean," I can redo the tar file and save space.
Since I tar the entire /home/local/nimbus directory, do you want to clean
all the `src' subdirectories, too?

P.S.  I'm at FL-1 today.

Chris,

Glad to have something smaller.  Since your cleanup I have created a new tar
file after your cleanup, so you're free to realease a new version of NIMBUS.

Chris,

I've been looking over the raw and processed data for the FSSP on WISP-94
870RF27 trying to figure out if what looks so strange to me is really OK.
(The FSSP concentrations are jumping all over the place from sample to
sample.)

I dumped each sample of the total accumulation values for ten seconds
(13:16:20 - 13:16:29) and compared the total accumulations (both from the
raw ADS data and the NIMBUS-processed netCDF data).  They both agree exactly,
so the accumulations coming from NIMBUS are correct.

I then compared the 10 sps individual concentrations (CFSSP_IBL) with the
combined concentrations (CONCF_IBL), both from the NIMBUS-processed netCDF
data.  The individual values jump around, but they agreed with each other
exactly, too.  (I added up each of the 15 cells in a sample to get the total
for CFSSP_IBL to use in the comparison.)

The true airspeed for all these data is between 109 and 111 m/s.

I brought up the amlib code for the FSSP.  Two other variables are used in
the concentration calculation:  beam fraction and activity.  I looked up
these variables in the netCDF file for the affected time period.  They are
just as wild as the concentrations and easily explain why the concentrations
look so strange.  Beam fraction and activity are derived from strobes and
resets, so I need to look at the raw ADS data for them to see if they are
bouncing around, too.

I am making progress, and I thank you for getting that program running for
me.  How difficult is it to modify, so I can grab values of strobes and
resets from the ADS data file?  It looks like it just may be entries in
a struct.

If I could find the struct definition for P16v2_blk, do you think I could
do it myself?

Chris,

Thanks for the code modification suggestions.  I was able to dump out the
STROBES and ACTIVITY signals easily.

It looks like the STROBES signal is causing most the variations.  There
are some large excursions in the ACTIVITY signal, also, but they are a
bit less extreme.

I'm going to compare the code used in GENPRO with that used in NIMBUS
to see if they operate the same way.  I remember some GENPRO test that,
if passed, would set the beam fraction to 0.4.  I don't know whether
that would solve this variation or not.

I'll take this up with Darrel next week after he returns.

Ron,
That should work just fine, remembering that the sample volume, using the
1 second averages of beam_fraction, activity and sample volume must be
calculated before total concentration *and* liquid water content at
the 10 Hz. That is what I think you are saying, so I see no reason to
delay the processing.

I'm issuing a notice to all project managers and to Jerry and Mike S.

Ron Ruth has recently discovered that for some reason, yet to be determined,
the total strobes and fast resets from the FSSP used in WISP-94 are not
being recorded correctly at 10 HZ. The 1Hz values look fine but at 10 Hz the
values fluctuate much too much, indicating that the counters on the FSSP
housekeeping board, where total strobes and fast resets are accumulated,
are somehow being sampled incorrectly. The 10 Hz Accepted counts (sum of
size channels 1-15) look fine.

 The NIMBUS processor presently computes (10 times per second):
 
  activity:
      fstrob*tau1 + freset*tau2
 
  beam_fraction:
      total_accumulation / fstrob
 
  sample_area:
      depth_of_field * beam_diameter
 
  sample_volume:
      distance * sample_area * beam_fraction * (1.0 - activity * 0.71)
 
  concentration:
      accumulation / sample_volume
 
  probe liquid water content from bin diameters and concentration
 
  average diameter from bin diameters and concentration
 

For the time being, until we can ascertain what is wrong with the 10Hz
total strobe and fast reset 10Hz values, to process 10 Hz data we propose
to calculate a one-second mean of the values for `strobes,' `resets' and
true airspeed.  Then, the mean values would be be used with each high-rate
accumulation in that second to compute the derived values shown above.

In the meantime, all 10 Hz FSSP data taken after the new housekeeping cards were
installed needs to be examined to see if this problem exists. If we change
nimbus to account for this problem now, then if we go back and need to
reprocess any data at the higher rate, the problem will be automatically
fixed. The impact of using averaged 1 second values mixed with the 1Hz values
will need to be assessed but my first estimate is that the error should be
fairly small.

Darrel,

While doing NIMBUS high-rate processing of the FSSP data for 4-870 WISP,
I noticed some rather strange cycle-to-cycle data changes.  The raw
accumulations are quite uniform, but the STROBES signal is varying
greatly.  The way we calculate concentrations, STROBES greatly affects
the concentration calculation, so those values are jumping around, too.

I have a netCDF file you can peruse:
    mistral:/home/local/staticdata/870rf11h.cdf

One good example is between 18:23 and 18:24.  Look at CONCF_IBL, FACT_IBL
and FSTB_IBL.  The true airspeed only varies by about 2 m/s during that
time.

I have released data from one of these WISP flights to the RAP people,
who wanted some quick turn-around, but I don't know whether I should have.
What do you think?  Is the probe messed up, or is this type of output to
be expected?  The raw ADS data from a dump agree with the netCDF data.

Darrel,

I'd like to get started with "fixing" the high-rate FSSP data on WISP (if it
is possible).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The NIMBUS processor presently computes (10 times per second):

 activity:
     fstrob*tau1 + freset*tau2

 beam_fraction:
     total_accumulation / fstrob

 sample_area:
     depth_of_field * beam_diameter

 sample_volume:
     distance * sample_area * beam_fraction * (1.0 - activity * 0.71)

 concentration:
     accumulation / sample_volume

 probe liquid water content from bin diameters and concentration

 average diameter from bin diameters and concentration

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

We talked yesterday about how to "fix" the data for WISP, since the strobe
(fstrob) and resets (freset) signals are suspect.  At that time we proposed
to calculate a one-second mean of the values for `strobes,' `resets' and
true airspeed.  Then, the mean values would be be used with each high-rate
accumulation in that second to compute the derived values shown above.

Does this still seem reasonable to you?  Is it OK if I get started on it,
or should I wait until you do more analysis with your lab setup?  Should
I talk with Jerry Pelk about the problem to see if he has any input?

Dear Marcia, Roy and Larry,

I have finished production processing of all the requested high-rate data
for 4-870 WISP-94.  These data have been archived to the SCD Mass Store
System (MSS) in the directory:  /RAF/1994/870/HRT.

In the course of processing the data, we discovered a hardware limitation
with the FSSP.  You will notice wild variations in the sample-to-sample
values of FSSP concentration (CFSSP_IBL, CONCF_IBL), liquid water content
(PLWCF) and other high-rate, derived, FSSP variables.  Because of this, we
plan to redo the calculations of all the derived FSSP variables.  I'm not
sure of a timetable, because we have to develop some software to do it.
I estimate it will take about two weeks.

In the meantime, the data on the MSS (See log file below.) can be used for
the other data (including the raw FSSP variables).  When revised data are
available, they will replace the data sets on the MSS, and I will contact
you again.

I apologize for this problem, but I thought you may be able to use the other
data, and I didn't want to delay their release until we had everything right.

Please contact me with any questions you may have.

P.S. to Larry:  If you want a tape of these interim data, please let me
                  know.

Yes, fact is the fraction of the time period that the probe was busy,
fact = Busy Time/Sample Time. Therefore, divide the calculated fact by
the sample period (0.04 for 25 Hz data).

Darrel,

I am reworking the HRT FSSP data for 4-870 WISP-94.  I have a question about
FSSP Activity.  When I look at the 1 sps data from the LRT processing, its
value is one order of magnitude greater than what I'm getting with the HRT
processing.  Is this value dependent on the sample rate to the extent that
I should be multiplying raw 10sps Activity values by ten?

Its value (fact) is used in calculating the sample volume:
       sv = sa * tas[i * 2]*0.1 * fbmfr[i] * (1.0 - (fact[i] * 0.71));

I know that the Strobes is also an order of magnitude less, but I'd expect
that when the sample rate is an order of magnitude higher.

Dear Marcia, Roy and Larry,

I have finished production processing of all the requested high-rate data
for 4-870 WISP-94.  These data have been archived to the SCD Mass Store
System (MSS) in the directory:  /RAF/1994/870/HRT.

As you will recall, in the course of processing the data, we discovered
a hardware limitation with two of the PMS-1D FSSP housekeeping variables.
It caused wild variations in the sample-to-sample values of FSSP
concentration (CFSSP_IBL, CONCF_IBL), liquid water content (PLWCF) and
other high-rate, derived, FSSP variables.  Because of this, we recalculated
all these derived FSSP variables by using one-second mean values for the
offending housekeeping variables.

These revised data sets (See log file below.) have replaced the uncorrected
data sets on the MSS.  (The uncorrected data are in the MSS bitfile path
/RAF/1994/870/OLDHRT.)
 
P.S. to Larry:  I am having the bitfiles put on ExaByte tar tape(s) for you.

Al,

The final, production, low-rate (1sps), NIMBUS netCDF data sets for the
4-870 WISP project are now ready.  Soon you will be getting a copy of RAF's
3-ring binder giving you detailed information about this project.  The
data have been archived on the NCAR/SCD Mass Store System (MSS) in the MSS
directory `/RAF/1994/870/LRT/fltno,' where "fltno" is the flight number.
(A complete listing follows this message.)

Do you want your own copies of the data on magnetic tape?  We can make
copies of the data on either 1/2" reels or ExaByte cartridges and send them
to you, or you may freely access the MSS data.  If you would like your own
copies, please let me know.

Al,

Ben Bernstein asked me whether the PMS-2D probes were any different
from the probes flown last year during 3-278 WISPIT on the KingAir.
I thought you might know.  If not, who should I ask?

Thanks.

Allen,

If you still have it, please mail me a copy of the email I sent to the WISP
folks on Monday regarding availablility of high-rate data for RF26.  I just
realized that certain PMS-1D variables were inadvertently output at low
rate, so I need to reprocess and let them know.

Allen,

I've checked over the `nimbus' HRT setup for WISP-94, and it looks OK to
me.  How about giving it a look-see.

Here's what you'll have to do:
  login as nimbus
  call up the sample WIPS file: /home/local/ADSdata/870rf42.ADS
  select a dummy output file name
  load the setup file `HRT.convert'

I have not processed a data file yet pending your setup evaluation.

Please note that the file /home/local/proj/870/Production/LowRateVars has
all the variables whose output rate should be changed to 1 sps.

Problems noted to date on Whisp 94:

 - 260x bin walking problem, this is the same problem which infected SCMS.
   histograms have more of a bell shaped curve instead of descending slope.
   Total concentrations appear to be low by about 40% (e.g. 155 instead 250).

 - 260x house keeping were decoded incorrectly (P6RST, P6TMP, P6E01, P6E64).
   Same as SCMS.

 - FSTRB spiked to 50.0 very frequently, this caused FSSP concentrations to
   be about 25% low (e.g. 134 instead of 177).  In the original processing
   we summed up strobes for the second and then replicated that average for
   the second.  In the new processing, any value of 50.0 was replaced with
   an interpolation, and then the despiker was turned on to remove spikes of
   400 counts or greater.

All files are available on mistral.

 Original processed LRT in /home/data/migs/ron/870Lrf27.cdf

 New files are /home/data/870rf27.cdf, 870rf27h.cdf (13:45-14:15).


On the good news side, I bleieve the FRANGE decoding problem (HRT sampling
only) has affected no projects.  Looking at the Whisp processor shows, that
at some point after Whisp I made a change to how the pointers were passed
into amlib functions.

The SCMS reprocessing turned up the problem!

>What's the status of the NIMBUS re-processor for WISP-94?

Waiting on Cooper, his daughter had a ski accident so he was out Mon/Tue.
This also means no SHEBA processing....


>Also, do you think we should change the SCMS netCDF headers
>to correct the affected PMS-1D size bins?

Eventually.
