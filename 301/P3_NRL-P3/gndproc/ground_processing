Beforehand:
 - create generic nimbus setup file to be used by all processing

Steps for "automated" processing at IHOP.
  Ron Ruth  29 April 2002

Assumption:  ground system has correct date/time

- operator to properly insert removable disk drive 
- login (if necessary)
 - .my_defaults file
  - set unique environment variables, if necessary
  - determine machine addresses (source/destination)
  - determine file transfer protocol/procedures to use
  - set distribution email list (project manager, data manager)
  - email distribution that process has started
- run "doit" script
 - check/set proper environment
  - DISPLAY variable
  - COPYADS == yes/no
  - COPYCDF == yes/no
  - COPYOTHER == yes/no (may need specific variable names)
  - destination machine names/logins/passwords ??
 - make sure removable drive partition is unmounted
 - make sure removable drive is physically present in the system (if needed)
 - mount drive (check for success)
 - if mount is not successful
  - notify appropriate people via screen and/or email
  - supply "fix" suggestions
  - ask that script be run again
  - exit (log out/reboot ?)
 - use log file and search removable drive for new files since last processing
 - check for duplicate file name(s) but without duplicate data (creation date,
    file length and flight date all may help to determine)
  - for each duplicate file name found
   - compose new, unique destination file name
   - log new file name
 - check space on local drive
  - if inadequate space
   - repeatedly remove oldest file that has been successfully copied to Jeffco
      until adequate room exists (use log file information)
   - send file deletion info to log file (also to email file)
   - if still inadequate space and no more files can be deleted
    - send failure email to distribution list
    - give operator the bad news
    - hopefully have a contingency plan in place
 - for each new file:
  - copy to local disk (with new name if necessary)
  - verify copy
 - unmount removable drive
 - notify operator to remove drive from ground system
 - notify that operator can depart
 - begin automatic operation
 - check that file transfer links are up
 - for each new file:
  - if ($COPYADS) copy raw ADS file to Jeffco
   - gzip raw ADS file
   - check for succesful file transfer
   - gunzip raw ADS file
  - create batch script based on new ADS file's name
  - run nimbus batch job sending all output to an unique output_log file
  - check for succesful nimbus completion
  - if ($COPYCDF) copy netCDF file to Jeffco
   - gzip netCDF file
   - check for succesful transfer
  - if ($COPYOTHER) copy other needed files to Jeffco (gzipped)
   - possibilities:  RDMA, PMS2D, nimbus output_log file
   - check for succesful transfer
  - if ($COPYJOSS)
   - if special file(s) is/are needed, produce it/them
      (usually a subset of the full netCDF file)
   - transfer "shared" data file(s) to JOSS repository
   - check for succesful transfer
  - update processing log file
 - check for successful completion of all tasks
 - check status of local disk (nearing capacity?)
 - make rudimentary entries in RAFDIS ??
 - compose job-completion report
 - send job-completion report email to distribution list
 - exit (log out?)
