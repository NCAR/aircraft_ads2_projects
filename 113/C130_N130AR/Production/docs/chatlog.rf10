Sep 19 09:41:05 <stith>	Yes, how is it going?
Sep 19 09:41:49 <cockpit-c130>	the delay for traffic will likely extend the time we need.
Sep 19 09:42:14 <--	dcrogers has quit (CGI:IRC)
Sep 19 09:42:57 <stith>	Well, we can always bill your payroll for any hours over 3 that are used
Sep 19 09:43:29 <beaton>	Could you ask Larry if clyde (computer on aerosol  rack) was booted up after satcom link was established?
Sep 19 09:43:35 <cockpit-c130>	we start our first leg in 5 minutes
Sep 19 09:44:03 <cockpit-c130>	no clouds for hundreds of miles

Sep 19 09:47:08 <beaton>	Larry,
Sep 19 09:47:18 <cockpit-c130>	jorgen said only to call with major problem,  we look good now
Sep 19 09:47:56 <beaton>	Larry, sorry, keep hitting return when I shouldn't. So long as the computer was booted up sometime after the  satcom link was established, that's all I need.
Sep 19 09:48:58 -->	dcrogers (~80755499@linus.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #IDEAS3
Sep 19 09:49:35 <Larry-c130>	OK, I misunderstood. We are rebooting now. What is the reason again?
Sep 19 09:50:07 <stith>	looks like dewpoint is out to lunch now.   It was not too bad lower.   It should do better than -20
Sep 19 09:50:45 <beaton>	It has to do with the computer making a connection to the UCAR network for DNS services so that it will accept ftp connections from the camera
Sep 19 09:59:59 <cockpit-c130>	jeff: dewpointers both look good here. -35
Sep 19 10:02:26 <stith>	dpxc was oscillating a bit, but now seems to have settled down

Sep 19 10:54:39 <beaton>	Note from jorgen: he says you will probably have to stick to 1000 feet AGL because of boats and fishermen

Sep 19 10:57:19 <beaton>	Jorgen also wants me to call him when you start you boundary layer run, so if you could let me know before you start that I will pass it along.

Sep 19 11:43:59 <beaton>	I tried calling Jorgen at 303-229-5926 but only get a message that there is no message box set up for this number. Is that the right number? I left a message on Michelle's cell number to have her call me.
Sep 19 11:44:48 <cockpit-c130>	new eta for Carter 1210.  Check number with Jeff of Shannon.
Sep 19 11:47:30 <beaton>	I got that number from Shannon via Jeff. I think I can't reach them because the cell coverage is bad. Very crackly and dropouts when talking to him earlier.
Sep 19 11:52:45 <cockpit-c130>	roger that. proceeding as planned.
