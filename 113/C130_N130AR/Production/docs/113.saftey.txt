SAFETY PROCEDURES

I. 	GENERAL FACTORS

A.	All RAF operations are carried out under applicable OSHA regulations.  Any questions regarding general safety procedures should be referred to the RAF Project Manager.  OSHA regulations will be made available upon request.  

B.	The installations of all user-supplied equipment must be performed in compliance with RAF Bulletin No. 13.  This Bulletin sets forth the procedures to be followed in the design, fabrication, and RAF approval of user-supplied equipment to be flown on board an NCAR aircraft.  


II. 	GROUND SAFETY

A.	All ground operations, including the installation, testing and maintenance of scientific equipment, application of electrical power, aircraft maintenance, loading, fueling and aircraft movements will be conducted by, or under, the supervision of qualified RAF personnel.

B.	The installation of all research equipment will be documented through a standardized Equipment Installation Form which requires a signed release from the project technician, RAF aeronautical engineer, and assigned RAF mechanic.  

C.	Prior to any flight operations, the project pilot will inspect the aircraft installation with regard to operational safety and emergency egress and will document his acceptance of the installation by signing the Equipment Installation Form.  

D.	Prior to departing for the field site, all project personnel will receive a "Climate Briefing" from the assigned project leader on possible local weather hazards.  Such items as the frequency of severe storms (hail, tornados, etc.), exposure to extreme cold, or the likelihood of extended intervals with temperatures exceeding 100 degrees F will be addressed.  

E.	There will be no smoking in or within 50 feet of the aircraft. 

F. 	All personnel working around the aircraft must familiarize themselves with the location of fire extinguishers within the aircraft and in the vicinity of the aircraft.

G.	Aircraft fuses or circuit breakers will be replaced or reset only with the consent of qualified RAF personnel.

H. 	At the completion of each day's activities, all liquids, refuse and litter will be removed from the aircraft and ramp areas. 

 I.	There will be no electrical power left on the aircraft without RAF supervision. 


III. 	FLIGHT PERSONNEL (FLIGHT CREW AND SCIENTIFIC OBSERVERS)

A. 	The cabin will normally be pressurized to cabin altitudes below 10,000 feet.  Research flight operations with cabin pressures above 12,000 feet will not be conducted unless this requirement has been stated at the time of the OFAP request.  Specialized training and more restrictive physical requirements for flight crews and observers are needed for such operations.

B. 	The pilot-in-command has the responsibility to ascertain that everyone onboard is familiar with normal and emergency procedures, and the use of the following equipment as pertinent to the flight: oxygen system and masks; the interphone system; emergency exits; and emergency survival equipment. 

C. 	Supplemental emergency oxygen is available for all persons aboard and must be used when the aircraft is operating at cabin altitudes above 10,000 feet. 


IV.	FLIGHT OPERATIONS

A. 	All flight operations will be conducted in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Regulations Part 91 Subpart B. 

	B.	The pilot-in-command is responsible for the safe conduct of all flight operations. 

C. 	Adequate rest for onboard personnel, both flight crew and scientific observers, is essential to the safe and efficient operations of NCAR aircraft in support of research programs.  RAF has established specific crew duty limits as follows:

	Maximum Crew Duty  Period:	 14 hours
	Any 24-hour period:			 10 flight hours
	Any consecutive 7 day period:	 35 flight hours
	Any 30 day period:			110 flight hours
	Consecutive working days:		    6 days
	Minimum crew rest period:		   12 hours

	All scientific observers are strongly encouraged to comply with these limits.  Any onboard observers who are deemed to be unfit for flight at the time of the pre-flight briefing will be barred from participating in that particular flight.

(Page 4 of 7) 

D. 	Research flight profiles often call for low altitude flying.  RAF flight operations conform to the minimum altitudes established in the appropriate FAR's.  When FAR's are not restrictive or when the restrictions have been waived for specific flights, RAF operations will be permitted to use the following guidelines:  

	Daylight, visual flight rule (VFR) conditions / level legs:	100 feet AGL
Daylight, visual flight rule (VFR) conditions / turning:	100 feet AGL
	Nighttime, visual flight rule (VFR) conditions:		500 feet AGL

E. 	There will be no smoking on any NCAR aircraft.  Smoking is only permitted in designated areas.  No smoking is permitted within 50 feet of parked aircraft, or flammable liquid storage points.  

F. 	In the event of fire, the crewmember observing the fire will warn the other crew members by shouting, "FIRE-FIRE" and reporting the location of the fire.  If smoke, fumes or fire are present within the personnel compartment, all occupants regardless of altitude will don pressure demand oxygen masks and select "100% OXYGEN" on his/her respective oxygen regulators.  All available means will be used to extinguish the fire.  

G. 	Research electrical power will normally be available at all times.  All power changes will be coordinated between the scientific observer and flight crew.  Any fuse replacement or circuit breaker reset in the primary power supply system will be performed only by or with the consent of the pilot-in-command. 

H. 	Any malfunction in scientific equipment, mechanical or electrical, will be immediately reported to the pilot-in-command.  No in-flight repairs will be permitted without permission from the RAF flight crew. 

I. 	Safety belts will be worn by all crewmembers during takeoff and landings and at such times as instructed by the flight crew.  

J.	All onboard personnel must wear shoes with closed toes.  Sandals are not to be worn on the aircraft at any time.

K. 	It will be the duty of the scientific crew aboard to properly adjust or secure research and related equipment prior to takeoff and landing.  However, it is the responsibility of the pilot-in-command to specifically check and ascertain that such duties have been satisfactorily completed. 

L.      Whenever an engine or the Auxiliary Power Unit is operation, hearing protection
will be worn near the aircraft.  Hearing protection will also be required within the 
aircraft if any of the cabin doors are open under the same conditions.

M.        The operation of user-supplied research equipment onboard the aircraft will only
 be permitted under the supervision of, or with the approval of the RAF and the 
 scientist concerned.

N. 	Emergency equipment and protective clothing will be carried on all NCAR aircraft, as required.  

V. 	MAINTENANCE 

A. 	All maintenance of, or modifications to, any user-supplied instrumentation installation must be supervised by RAF FAA certified mechanics, or inspected by them prior to flight.

VI. 	HAZARDOUS MATERIAL AND TOXIC GASES	 

A. 	Hazardous materials or toxic gases will not be carried aboard NCAR aircraft without review and permission from the RAF Safety Committee.  Applicable Federal and OSHA regulations will be adhered to in each case.  Provisions for dealing with said materials or gases will be defined by the RAF Safety  Committee in coordination with the NCAR Safety Office and applicable regulations.  All hazards will be declared and listed by each participant on the RAF's Hazardous Materials and Devices Form.  (See appendix B).  The appropriate Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for each hazard will be carried aboard the aircraft.  


EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING

I. 	GENERAL 

	Emergency equipment and protective clothing will be carried aboard NCAR aircraft for the following purposes: 

* To cope with air and ground emergencies. 
* To sustain crew members' lives in case of forced landings. 

II. 	AIRBORNE EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT 

Emergency equipment is divided into two categories as listed below.  Emergency equipment is considered a part of the aircraft and will not be carried by individual crew members.  Scientific crew may carry tools necessary for airborne maintenance and specialized research equipment.  Crew judgment is the paramount factor deciding emergency equipment needs.
