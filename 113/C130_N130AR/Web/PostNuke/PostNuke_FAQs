Manually resetting (clearing) the admin through MySQL pn_user table record editing.

I looked through the forums and ran a search here, and couldn't find documented way of clearing the password through MySQL, so I though I would document here.

Sorry if this seems redundant for most of you...

Well, I installed a postnuke on a machine a few months back for module testing and personal blogging, and basically forgot about. I revisited the site today and noticed that I had been using it for personal blogging on ecommerce. I couldn't remember the password or the email I used for admin access.

Basically if you clear the password record of the admin uid in pn_users, you can just login using the admin name with no password.

How to reset your admin password using phpadmin step by step:

    * Go to the mySQL DB in phpmyadmin and open the nuke_users table.
    * click 'browse'
    * pn_uid number should be the admin account - select that id and click 'edit' - make note of the name if it is not 'admin'.
    * copy the string in the pn_pass field and save it for temporary safe keeping.
    * Clear the password field.
    * goto your postnuke install and login using the admin name - leave the password field blank
    * You should have access to the admin account at this point, immediately reset your password
