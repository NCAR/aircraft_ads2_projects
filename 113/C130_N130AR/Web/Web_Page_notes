Set up web page (for the main screen) with:
+ Current mission status
+ Link to Data download
+ List of completed flights (flight matrix ??)
x Link to "How tos"
x Brief explanation of what's on the home page (layout)

Add an "Inflight Info" category to left side
- chat access
- ION access

Can I generate a flight matrix and add it as a link?
  column titles
+   fltno
+   date
+   times
+   mission statement
+   instrument anomalies
x     links to specific instrument forum topics?
x   link to flight forum topic
+   links to data download (netCDF, MCR, CPI)
+   whole-flight plots

Administration of PostNuke

Sometimes (often?), when logged in and making administrative changes, it
"forgets" that you are logged in and denies the operation you're attempting.
Logging out then back in sometimes fixes it.  Completely restarting the
browser also sometimes fixes it.  Sometimes just repeatedly trying fixes it.
I haven't yet found a sure cure.

Gotchas:
  Calendar
    Make sure to set distribution to "Global"
    Fill in all required information (date, titles, etc.)
  News
    Make sure to set your article to post, if you can.
    Administrators may still have to "approve" their own posts.

PHP settings different from what PostNuke wants:
 syrah:/etc/php.ini (if it is the controlling version)
  magic_quotes_gpc = On  (PostNuke wants:  magic_quotes_gpc = Off)

4 September 2003
PostNuke posted an error and would not come up.  I had been logged in at
the time.  It was unique to me and not dependent on any other user.
Instead of coming up it produced the following message:

   Warning: Failed opening 'modules/ruth/index.php' for
   inclusion (include_path='.:/php/includes:/usr/share/php')
   in /var/www/html/IDEAS3/index.php on line 127

In successive order I tried to clear the problem by shutting down and
restarting mozilla, logging out of my Linux session and rebooting the
computer.  None of these had any effect.  I finally traced it to something
within the Mozilla browser.  Since I also have a "KDE_ruth" profile which
I normally use at FL, I fired up a second version of Mozilla and used it
instead.  It brought up the IDEAS3 web site without a problem.  I then
logged in and out a few times exiting the KDE version while logged out
of the IDEAS3 web site.  All this didn't matter when the original Mozilla
profile was used.  So, at present, I must use the KDE_ruth profile to access
the IDEAS3 web site!.  I set up an additional Mozilla profile in case it,
too, goes belly-up.

I guess I need to go searching within my .mozilla subdirectory for some
file that is corrupted.

What caused this problem is a cookie (.atd.ucar.edu:name) set by the ATD Data
Retrieval web page.  I'm not sure if PostNuke sets one with the same name,
but when the info is filled in for the data retrieval page, the "name" field
saved in the cookie file is used by PostNuke and its value shows up in the
error message.  It apparently tries to load a module with whatever is entered
there.  If the Data Retrieval "name" field is left blank, it reports an error
and wants it filled in.  I used the <space> character, and it replaced it with
an underscore (_).  This caused the same error in PostNuke.  Therefore, at
least with Mozilla on Linux, anyone who uses the Retrieval page, is going to
have a problem with PostNuke.
