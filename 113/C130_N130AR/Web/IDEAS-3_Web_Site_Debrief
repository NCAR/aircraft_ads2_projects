IDEAS-3 Web Site Debriefing  2 October 2003
Discuss
 - good and bad (site usage during the project)
     (chat and email list were on the site but are independent functions)
 - how long do we keep the site active?  (post-project follow-up, sharing, etc.)
 - support issues (manpower, security patches, module updates)
    PostNuke, MySql, PHPBB
 - portability (clone and adapt for other projects)
 - changes/enhancements/deletions
    (e.g., Forum little used, equipment status page)
 - is there a better way?
 - can we live without it?

Attendees:  Allen Schanot
              Dave Rogers
              Jeff Stith
              Janet Anstett
              Mike Daniels
              Jorgen Jensen

Notes:
 - archival issues
 - complex and hard to navigate (had to "get to know" it)
 - students had keen interest
 - Allen liked format for IDEAS-2 web site better
    use email or face-to-face for communications for most projects
    new web site too complicated
 - Jeff liked the new features and the calendar, the technology upgrade,
    but it took a lot more mantenance and work.  It was hard to use.
 - Do we need the "sign-in" feature?  (keeps the masses from accessing
    certain sensitive areas of the site)
 - Allen:  need to balance the effort versus the benefit.  I'd like to
    have a web page that has clickable status that I can update myself.
 - AIRS-II (Alliance Icing Research Study II) will have 3 venues:
    Montreal, Ottawa and Cleveland.  JOSS is not involved.  We need a
    central web site where we can post status and forecasts.
   - use conference calling a series of concurrent web pages to view
   - use "netmeeting" software
   - Jorgen needs the web stuff that will help the project, customized
      for AIRS-II.  Need to find necessary web links.
 - Mike:  can we make a connection between the email list, news and calendar
    so events can be entered once instead of three times?
 - Allen:  calendar not useful for standard projects, but the contact
    information is extremely useful:
     participants and email
     field contact info
     floor plan
     access to ION and chat
     one status bulletin (the current one)
     summary forms for each flight 
     per-flight equipment status
 - Mike:  Do what JOSS does?  Possible alternatives:
   - don't worry about JOSS and develop what meets our needs
   - work with JOSS and do something together
 - Mike:  Involve Bob Rilling in this, too
 - Dave:  Give ION comments to Janet
