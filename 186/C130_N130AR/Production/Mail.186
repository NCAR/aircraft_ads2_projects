Krista,

I would review it easily if my Linux box could handle Word files.  Could
you please resend it to me as a text file?

Thanks!

All,

During Henry's and my recent site survey trip to St. Croix, I took a
number of digital pictures.  These have been placed on a web site here
at the RAF so that interested parties can take a look.  To check out
these pictures, go to the following site:

http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/~krista/stcroix/

Simply click on each of the links on the above page to view the
pictures.

I also brought back some information pamphlets/booklets on St. Croix.  I
have placed these on the table in the RAF library, and RAF staff should
feel free to drop by the library and take a look at these materials.
Please note, however, that there are only single copies of most of the
materials.  So, please do not remove these items from the library.  The
one exception here is a sheet listing restaurants in St. Croix.  I have
made several copies of this, so please feel free to take one.

I am in the process of preparing the site survey report from our trip
and hope to distribute this early next week.  In the mean time, please
feel free to contact either Henry or I should you have any questions.

Krista

All,

The field deployment dates for the PELTI program have been finalized.
The C-130 will depart Jeffco on Wednesday, 5 July and will arrive in St.
Croix on Thursday, 6 July.  (The aircraft and crew will overnight in
Miami on 5 July.)  Research operations will begin on Friday, 7 July.
The last possible day of research operations will be Tuesday, 25 July,
and the C-130 will depart St. Croix on Wednesday, 26 July to arrive at
Jeffco on Thursday, 27 July.

It should be noted that, should the PELTI research flights be completed
prior to 25 July, the C-130 will return to Jeffco at an earlier date.
However, at present, all RAF staff and PELTI investigators should plan
for a 5-26 July deployment period.

Please email me if you have any questions on the above.

Krista

Subject: PELTI Accommodations in St. Croix
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

All,

This message primarily concerns RAF staff who will be traveling into the
field for PELTI.  If you will not be involved with field travel to St.
Croix for PELTI, you may ignore this message.

Peter Locke of Chenay Bay Beach Resort in St. Croix has offered the RAF
and the PELTI scientists an extremely good nightly rate for individual
cottages at their resort.  Instead of the roughly $158 per night cottage
rate, we have been offered a nightly rate of $70 per night per cottage
or $80 per night per cottage.  Taxes will be additional.  (The $80 per
night is for the premium cottages.   Five RAF staff or PELTI
investigators will need to stay in premium cottages so that the total
number of cottages needed -- 22 -- can be made available.)  Each cottage
has an equipped kitchenette, air conditioning, cable TV, etc., and the
resort itself offers tennis, snorkeling, a bar, and a restaurant.
Chenay Bay is rated as a three-star resort and is a "superior tourist
class" hotel.You can find more info. on Chenay Bay on-line at:

www.chenaybay.com

The rates offered to us for Chenay Bay are the most reasonable Henry and
I have seen for accommodations in St. Croix.  The two "closest
competitors" are The Buccaneer, which has a nightly government rate of
$95 plus taxes, and the Hotel Caravelle, which has offered us a 10%
discount off of their regular room rates ($95 per night for a "superior"
room)  Taxes for the Caravelle would be additional.

In order to make it easier for RAF staff and PELTI investigators to
communicate with each other and to keep one another in the loop
regarding project schedules, etc., I would like to proceed with making
reservations for all RAF staff to stay at Chenay Bay Resort.  I note
that, at this time, it appears that most (if not all) of the PELTI
investigators will also be staying at Chenay Bay.  Not only will this
enable RAF staff and the investigators to communicate with each other
more easily, but I believe that Chenay Bay offers a nice location and a
nice accommodation option at a nightly rate that is within the
government maximum lodging amount for St. Croix.  Also, Chenay Bay
offers us a fair amount of off-street parking, something which (as I
mentioned in the site survey report) is difficult to find at the hotels
in Christiansted.  Thus, we shouldn't face hassles with parking our
rental cars.

By Tuesday, 30 May, I need to contact the manager of Chenay Bay with
names of RAF staff and credit card numbers to hold reservations.  I
would like to strongly encourage all RAF staff to stay at the same
location (Chenay Bay).  However, should a RAF staff member wish to
consider staying at another location, please notify me by Tuesday, 30
May so that I can adjust the number of reservations to be made
accordingly.  Please note, however, that if a RAF staff member chooses
to stay at a location other than Chenay Bay, that staff member will be
responsible for checking in with me (the project manager in the field)
regarding project schedules, etc.  I cannot be responsible for calling
around to several different hotels in order to inform project personnel
of C-130 operations schedules.  Further, should you wish to stay at
another location, you will be responsible for making your own
reservations accordingly.

That's all for now.  Let me know if you have any questions about the
above and/or if you would like some additional info. about Chenay Bay.
I have a pamphlet for the resort here in my office.

Thanks!

Krista

Subject: Power in the PELTI Office at St. Croix Airport
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Length: 1555
Status: RO

All,

I just spoke with Dick Nackenhorst at Bohlke International Airways at the
St.  Croix Airport, and I wanted to pass along some information regarding
the type and availability of power in the office building we will be using
during PELTI.

As probably everyone already knows, the power in St. Croix is the same as in
the U.S. (110/60 cycle), same style outlets, etc.  Dick also told me that the
office we will be using has a backup generator that kicks in should power be
lost.  Thus, it sounds like we may not have too many problems with power (at
least in our office).  However, to protect against any unforeseen problems,
I would still like to recommend that we (the RAF) and PELTI investigators
bring UPSs for any computers to be set up in the office for data perusal.
From the RAF's standpoint, we will only be bringing one workstation into the
field, so shipping one UPS to cover this system shouldn't be a big problem.

PELTI investigators -- If you don't already have UPS units that you can use
with your field computers, I would recommend that you consider purchasing
some prior to the July deployment.

Also, I seem to recall that there are a fair number of available wall outlets
in the office we will be using.  Nevertheless, I think that both RAF staff and
PELTI investigators should plan on bringing several extension cords and power
strips with us into the field.  This will hopefully aid in getting all of our
equipment hooked up in the office in a safe manner.

Let me know if you have any questions on the above.  Thanks!

Krista

RAF Staff and PELTI Investigators,

I will be out of the office this Thursday and Friday (25 and 26 May).  While
I am gone, Dick Friesen will be covering for me as the PELTI project manager.
Therefore, please contact Dick directly (rbf@ucar.edu or 303-497-1047) with
any PELTI questions/issues you may have.  Dick is still presently out of the
office on TOPSE travel but should be back at the RAF tomorrow (Thurs. 25 May).

I will be back in the office on Tuesday, 30 May and will resume PELTI
responsibilities at that time.

Thanks!

The following is a quick message for those RAF staff who will be traveling
into the field for PELTI.

To secure the reduced room (cottage) rate at Chenay Bay Beach Resort, I need
to make reservations at Chenay Bay for RAF staff by the end of day today
(Tuesday, 30 May).  My present plan is to proceed with reserving cottages for
all nine RAF staff who will be working in St. Croix.  Please let me know by
the end of today if any RAF staff assigned to PELTI will be making their own
accommodations arrangements.  If I do not hear from anyone, I will proceed
with making the nine reservations at Chenay Bay.

One additional note.  The management of Chenay Bay has asked for the first
three nights for each of the nine cottages up front as a deposit.  I will be
making arrangements to pay for this deposit using a check from NCAR.  So, RAF
staff assigned to PELTI should note that the first three nights of lodging
will already be paid for.

All,

I will be out of the office from 3-19 June 2000 on my honeymoon.  During my
absence, Dick Friesen will be the acting PELTI project manager.  So, please
go to Dick directly with any PELTI questions and/or issues you may have
while I am gone.  Dick can be reached by phone at 303-497-1047 or by email
at rbf@ucar.edu.  For those PELTI investigators who will be (or are) working
at the RAF, you can also locate Dick in his office in Room 129 (just down the
hall from Jason Peete's office.)  I will be back in the office on Tuesday,
20 June 2000 and will resume PELTI project management responsibilities at
that time.

RAF Staff and Contracts -- Should you have any questions regarding PELTI
account charges and/or authorizations, please contact either Dick or Gerry
Albright (x1039 or albright@ucar.edu).  Should any purchase orders or other
orders for PELTI be submitted during my absence, please place a copy of the
relevant paperwork in my box so that I can keep a record of project costs.

I'll see you all again in a couple of weeks.  In the mean time, good luck
with the start of C-130 preparations for PELTI!

Krista

To RAF staff involved with Pelti:

Caddis (the ground station) is up and running.  It will be on the
network through next Friday, June 23.  At this point it will be taken
off the network to ensure that everything will work fine in the
field.  If there are any files that you will need for pelti, please
read the information below about where files should be located on
caddis and put these files on caddis by next Friday.  Your user login
and passwd is the same on caddis as on mistral.  The user home
directories that will be available in the field are currently under
/hfield/9.  /fnet is the directory with a similar structure to /jnet.
/fnet will be available in the field.  Any files that are currently
located under /jnet or /h/9 will not be available once caddis is off
of the network.  /fnet and /hfield/9 would be the correct places to
put files that you will need in the field.

You can start testing software that you will be using in the field
now, and starting June 26, do a final test just to make sure that
everything on caddis is set up correctly.  This last test will involve
sitting down at the caddis console and logging in, since caddis will
no longer be on the network.

See me if you have any questions.

Subject: C-130 Weighing and Test Flight Schedule
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Length: 2400
Status: RO

All,

After reviewing the C-130 preparation schedule, Dick Friesen, Bob Olson, and I
have come up with a tentative plan for the weighing of the C-130 for PELTI and
for the first test flight.  I use the word "tentative" here, as we all need to
bear in mind that this schedule may need to be altered over the next couple of
days as work to install instrumentation on the aircraft continues.

Right now, we are planning on weighing the C-130 on Thursday (6/22) morning.
This task will require approximately 2-3 hours.  Please note that all of the
instrumentation racks, the major instrumentation, the seats, and components
of the aircraft oxygen system must be installed in the aircraft by end of day
tomorrow (Wed., 6/21) in order to make this weighing schedule.

Once the aircraft has been weighed, it will be pulled from the hangar, and a
run-up of engine number 3 will be performed.  Once this run-up and tests of
engine 3 have been completed and are successful, the aircraft will become
available for the first test flight.  At present, it should be planned that
takeoff for this first test flight will be in the middle of the afternoon
on Thursday, 22 June, perhaps around 2:00 or 2:30.

While the C-130 is being weighed, we will have a meeting of all RAF staff
going into the field for PELTI and of the PELTI investigators.  During this
meeting, the safety briefing for the project will be performed, and we will
go over what items RAF staff and PELTI PIs wish to ship on the C-130 to
St. Croix.  After we have the final weight of the aircraft and payload, we
will then be able to decide how much equipment can be shipped on the C-130
and how much must be shipped commercially.

It is required that all PELTI investigators and RAF staff who will be flying
on the C-130 during PELTI attend this safety briefing.  I will email out a
definite time for this meeting once we know for sure that weighing of the
aircraft will take place on Thursday morning.

As I mentioned above, please be aware that the above schedule must remain
fluid.  Should we encounter additional delays in terms of installing racks
and equipment on the aircraft, it may became necessary to slip the schedule
for weighing the aircraft and conducting the safety briefing.  I will, of
course, keep you all informed of any changes to the above schedule.

Please contact me if you have any questions on the above.  Thanks!

Krista

Status: RO

All,

I just spoke with Barry and Steve Howell, and it turns out that the TAS has
inadvertently been shipped to South Carolina rather than to Jeffco here in
Colorado.  Thus, the TAS will now not arrive here at the RAF until Thursday
(6/22) morning.  We will, therefore, not be conducting the first test flight
on Thursday afternoon.  Barry has asked that this first flight instead be
moved to Friday (6/23) morning.

Barry and I have set a takeoff time of 9:00 a.m. for this flight on Friday.
This mission will be around 1-1.5 hours in duration.

I forgot to mention in my last email message that, while the C-130 is being
weighed and the engine run-up is being performed, PIs will not be able to
have access to the aircraft.  The whole process of weighing the aircraft
and performing the engine check will hopefully be completed within about
4-5 hours.  RAF staff will begin weighing the aircraft as soon as possible
Thursday morning so that, hopefully, all of the weighing and checks can be
completed by early afternoon.  This will allow the PELTI PIs to have access
to the aircraft and their instruments during the afternoon in preparation
for the Friday morning flight.

As I mentioned previously, the RAF will conduct the project safety briefing
and a discussion of shipping requirements while the weighing and engine check
are taking place.  I have set a time of 9:00 a.m. on Thursday, 6/22 for this
safety briefing and meeting.  This meeting will be held in the RAF conference
room.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the above schedule.

Thanks!

Krista

Subject: C-130 Crew for Ferry to St. Croix, Security Badges
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Length: 3049
Status: RO

All,

Dick Friesen and I have been reviewing the list of individuals who have
requested seats on the C-130 during ferry of the aircraft to St. Croix from
Jeffco.  At present, the number of people requiring seats exceeds the maximum
allowable number of 19.  Thus, we need to very quickly reach an agreement
regarding which crew members will, in fact, travel to St. Croix on the C-130.
I say "quickly," because those individuals who will not be going on the
C-130 need to have adequate time in which to make airline reservations.
Also, we need to finalize the list of people traveling on the C-130 so that
arrangements can be made in Miami for accommodations for the C-130 crew
while the aircraft is in transit to St. Croix.

According to the list Dick and I have, the following individuals
require/have requested seats on the C-130:
  Barry Huebert (UH)
  Bernie La Fleur (DU)
  Byron Blomquist (UH)
  Steve Howell (UH)
  Mitchell Pinkerton (UH)
  Tim Bertram (UH)
  Don Thornton (Drexel)
  Glenn Mitchell (Drexel)
  Lynn Russell (Princeton)
  Jui-Chen Liu (Princeton)
  Steve Maria (Princeton)
  Henry Boynton (RAF)
  Ed Ringleman (RAF)
  John Cusack (RAF)
  Kurt Zrubek (RAF)
  George Nicoll (RAF)
  Mike Spowart (RAF)
  Bob Olson (RAF)
  Jim Nolan (RAF)
  Chris Webster (RAF)
Total:  20 people

I note that I have not included Jim Anderson in the above list, as he has
indicated that he is willing to travel to St. Croix commercially.  At this
point in time, I feel that we will need to take Jim up on this offer.

It is my strong preference that all RAF staff assigned to PELTI travel to
St. Croix on the C-130.  This will allow the RAF to save a considerable amount
of travel dollars in Barry's approved PELTI budget.  (And, obviously, it is
mandatory that the pilots, Henry and Ed, the flight engineer, John Cusack,
one of the RAF technicians, and the two mechanics, Bob and Jim, fly on the
aircraft.)

So, as you can tell from the above list, one of the above-listed people will
not be able to travel on the C-130 to St. Croix.  I would like to discuss this
matter during the safety briefing meeting tomorrow (Thurs., 6/22) morning at
9:00 a.m. so that we can resolve the ferry crew list.  So, please give some
thought as to how you feel we can resolve this matter.

Also, one additional note regarding security badges at the airport in
St. Croix.  Prior to my departure for my vacation, I was notified by the
security office at the airport that security badges will not be issued
until we have all arrived "on the spot" in St. Croix.  (The badges are time
sensitive.)  So, please make a note that we will all need to make some time
in our schedules immediately after our arrival (probably on Friday, 7 July)
to get these badges issued.  Also, please be aware that an administrative
fee of $5 per badge will be charged.  So, each of the PELTI investigators
will need to have cash available to pay for his/her badge.

That's all for now.  Please remember the safety briefing/general PELTI
meeting tomorrow (Thurs., 6/22) at 9:00 a.m. in the RAF conference room.

Thanks!

Krista

All,

I spoke with Bob Olson yesterday, and he let me know that John Cusack (the
RAF flight engineer) will be unavailable here at the RAF on Tuesday 27 June.
Thus, everyone should take note that it will not be possible to conduct a
PELTI test flight on that date.

Thanks!

All,

To make sure we're all on the same page, I wanted to email out the schedule
for tomorrow's test flight.  Here's what is presently planned:
  7:30 a.m. -- C-130 pulled from hangar
  7:45 a.m. -- Power on aircraft for pre-flight warm-up
  8:45 a.m. -- Door close
  9:00 a.m. -- Take off
Note that this flight will be about 1-1.5 hours in duration.

Also, please note that for those PIs needing an aircraft safety briefing,
this will be done at 7:45 a.m. on the C-130 prior to the flight.

Should it not be possible to get the first test flight in on Friday, all RAF
staff and PELTI PIs should be aware that we will conduct the test flight on
Saturday, 6/24.  Should a Saturday flight be necessary, the takeoff time and
schedule will be set and announced as soon as possible on Friday.

Also, it has been decided that power will be provided on the C-130 on
Saturday for 8 hours.  The exact hours will be announced on Friday.

Please let me know if you have any questions on the above.

Content-Length: 1517
Status: RO

All,

I just spoke with Bob Olson, and he informed me that some fairly major work
will need to be done on the C-130 APU early next week to replace a gasket.
Bob expects the new gasket to arrive on Monday, 26 June.  As soon as this
part arrives, the mechanics will begin work to repair the APU.  However, all
PELTI PIs and RAF staff should note that this repair could take a few days.
Monday and Tuesday (6/26 and 6/27) were scheduled to be non-flight days,
anyway, so work on the APU will be conducted on those two days.  However,
Bob has asked me to pass along the message that Wednesday, 6/28 should
presently be considered questionable in terms of a possible test flight,
should APU work still be going on on that date.

I will, of course, keep you all updated as to the status of the aircraft
as the APU work progresses.

One further note.  Because of the risks associated with operating the APU in
its present state, we will not be able to use it during "start-up" for the
test flight tomorrow (Sat., 6/24).  Thus, PIs and RAF staff should be aware
that the start-up and power transfer sequence may be slightly different
tomorrow.  We should still be able to perform the flight tomorrow, but
everyone should be aware of the APU limitation up front.  I will forward on to
the PIs and RAF staff any changes to the start-up/power transfer sequence that
I hear of so that everyone can take these changes into account when powering
up instrumentation.

Let me know if you have any questions on the above.

Krista

Content-Length: 2207
Status: RO

All,

I just spoke with Steve Howell, and I wanted to pass along the latest info
regarding the status of the LTI and the C-130 schedule for the next day or so.

First, Steve informed me that Bernie Lafleur has the new porous diffuser in
the lab at DU and is presently testing it.  By early this afternoon (Tues.
6/27), Steve will hear from Bernie whether the LTI works or not.  If the LTI
does not work, Steve still wants to do a test flight tomorrow (Wed., 6/28)
afternoon.  Should the LTI not work today, the C-130 will takeoff at 2:00 p.m.
for the first test flight.  This will involve a 1:45 p.m. door close, with
the aircraft being pulled outside at 12:30 p.m. and power being put on the
aircraft at 12:45 p.m.

If the LTI does work in the lab this afternoon, we will push the test flight
takeoff time to 3:00 p.m. in order to give Bernie a bit more time to install
and plumb the LTI.  This schedule will involve a 2:45 p.m.  door close, with
power being put on the aircraft outside at 1:45 p.m.

As soon as I hear from Steve Howell this afternoon regarding the status of the
LTI, I will let all of you know and we will finalize the test flight schedule
for tomorrow.

A couple of notes regarding either test flight schedule.  First, I am asking
that all PELTI PIs have all of their instrumentation "buttoned up" and flight
ready by 12:00 p.m.  Also, any loose items not needed during the test flight
(tools, spares, etc.) should be removed from the aircraft by 12:00 p.m.  This
schedule will allow us all to be ready for either a 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m.
takeoff and will hopefully enable us to avoid any delays.

Second, all RAF staff and PELTI investigators are advised that a run-up of
the newly-repaired APU will need to be done tomorrow.  It is presently planned
that this APU checkout will be done right after the C-130 is pulled out of
the hangar for the test flight.  This run-up will hopefully only take a few
minutes, but everyone is advised that there may be a few minutes during this
test when access to the C-130 will not be possible.

Let me know if you have any questions on the above, and I'll keep everyone
informed as to the status of the LTI and the schedule for tomorrow.

Krista

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Status: RO

All,

I just spoke with Ed Ringleman, and he informed me that the new GPS system
on the C-130 needs to be certified prior to the continuation of C-130 flights
for PELTI.  This certification process will require that missed approaches be
flown with the aircraft near Ft. Collins.  It is presently planned that these
missed approaches will be performed during the test flight tomorrow.  However,
this will require that some changes be made to the schedule.

First, the plan will be to fly the C-130 north of Jeffco and to give the PELTI
PIs the first 1-1.5 hours for research purposes.  After this portion of the
flight has been completed, the next hour will be taken up with the missed
approaches (three) near Ft. Collins followed by the ferry of the aircraft back
to Jeffco.  Thus, RAF staff and PELTI PIs should now plan on this first test
flight lasting from 2-2.5 hours.

Second, the RAF would like to make every effort to have the C-130 back on the
ground here at Jeffco by around 4:00-4:30 p.m.  The goal here is to try and
limit the amount of overtime that needs to be charged to the PELTI program
prior to the aircraft going into the field.  Thus, it has been decided that
whether or not the LTI is working on the C-130 tomorrow, takeoff time will be
at 2:00 p.m.  This schedule will require a 1:45 p.m. door close and that the
aircraft be pulled from the hangar at 12:30 p.m.  Power will be put on the
aircraft outside at 12:45 p.m., after the APU run-up and check.

PELTI PIs -- By 3:30 p.m. today (Tues., 6/27), please let me know the number
and names of people in your group who would like seats on the C-130 tomorrow
for the test flight.  I will then work out the crew list for the flight.

Thanks, and let me know of any questions you may have on the above.

All,

I need to pass along a request for information and also distribute some
information regarding the C-130 schedule for later this week.

First, I need information from those PELTI investigators wishing to ship some
spares and instruments on the C-130.  If you wish to do so, you must email me
a complete list of the items you wish to take on the C-130 -- along with each
item's dimensions and weight -- by 12:00 p.m. Wednesday, 6/28.  I realize
this deadline is coming up rather quickly and that all of you are busy on the
C-130.  However, I must give information regarding what may potentially be
going on the C-130 to Henry and Ed so that they can take a look at the weights
and balances data and make sure we can safely accommodate everything.  Should
we find we don't have room for some items, the early deadline will then give
you the time needed to make arrangements to ship items to St. Croix.  You can
either email me your list or write it out and give it to me.  Please note that
you do not need to include personal baggage in this list, as allowances for
such baggage have already been made in the weights and balances calculation.

Second, with the departure of the C-130 scheduled for the morning of
Wednesday, 5 July (right after the four-day July 4th holiday weekend), we
(the RAF) must pack up the aircraft on Friday, 30 June.  At present, the RAF
is planning that the C-130 can be kept available for a test flight as late
as Friday morning.  However, the afternoon of 30 June must be dedicated to
packing the aircraft.  Thus, all PELTI PIs are asked to note that packing of
the C-130 will begin at 1:00 p.m. on Friday, 30 June.  As a consequence of
this schedule, the C-130 must be back here at Jeffco from a potential Friday
morning test flight by 12:00 p.m. at the latest.

I will shortly designate a staging area in the hangar where all items to go
to St. Croix on the C-130 should be placed.  I will let you all know of this
location once it has been designated.  Just in case we (PELTI PIs and RAF
staff) are tied up with a test flight Friday morning, I am asking that all of
us plan on having all C-130 shipment items at the staging area by end of the
day on Thursday 29 June.

One final item regarding express shipping of items to and from St. Croix.
Both FedEx and DHL operate in St. Croix, so either company appears to be a
possibility for getting items to and from the project in a hurry.  I have
given copies of the relevant St. Croix FedEx and DHL information to each of
the PELTI group chiefs, but you can also check out either the FedEx or the DHL
web sites (www.fedex.com and www.dhl.com, respectively) for more information.
The address to use for shipping items to PELTI personnel in St. Croix was
included in the site survey report prepared by Henry and me.  Let me know if
you need another copy of this report.

That's all for now.  Please contact me if you have any questions on the
above.

Krista

All,

Okay, we've designated a staging area in the hangar for items to be shipped
on the C-130 to St. Croix.  As you exit the double blue doors from the
maintenance room into the hangar, you will see an open area on the floor where
a couple of boxes with orange "PELTI" tags have been placed.  Please place all
items to be shipped on the C-130 in this area.

Also, I would like to ask everyone (both PELTI PIs and RAF staff) preparing
boxes for shipment on the C-130 to attach a sheet of paper to the outside of
each box summarizing briefly the items contained in the box.  (RAF staff -- I
note that some of you have already prepared packing lists for your gray boxes.
In this case, you don't need to attach the exterior sheet.)  Also, please
write the weight of the box on this sheet.  This labelling could prove helpful
should U.S. Customs have any questions when the C-130 is clearing St. Croix to
head home.

And as a friendly reminder amidst all of the other activity, please remember
to have all of your boxes placed in the staging area by the end of the day
tomorrow (Thurs., 6/29).

Thanks!

Krista

All,

Following our 2:00 p.m. status meeting today, I wanted to email everyone some
information regarding the test flight schedule for tomorrow (Fri. 6/30), as
well as information regarding the power schedule for this coming weekend and
regarding next week's departure for St. Croix.

TEST FLIGHT #2
--------------
The schedule for test flight number 2 on Friday, 6/30 will be as
follows:
  7:30 a.m. -- C-130 pulled out from hangar
  7:45 a.m. -- Power on aircraft outside
  8:45 a.m. -- Door close
  9:00 a.m. -- Takeoff
Please plan on a 2-2.5 hour mission.  Also, I would like to ask that all
people going on the test flight be on the aircraft and ready to go by
8:30 a.m.  This will enable us to insure that we close the door promptly
at 8:45 a.m. without having to leave anyone behind.

POWER SCHEDULE FOR THE JULY 4TH HOLIDAY WEEKEND
-----------------------------------------------
RAF staff have agreed to provide power on the aircraft on two days over
the upcoming holiday weekend.  Power will be available on the aircraft on
Saturday, 1 July from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. and again on Monday, 3 July
from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.  There will be no power on the aircraft on either
Sunday, 2 July or Tuesday, 4 July.  However, PIs wishing to work on the
aircraft without power can do so on those days.

DEPARTURE FOR ST. CROIX
-----------------------
Following today's test flight, it is Barry Huebert's opinion that the aircraft
and instrumentation will be ready for a Wednesday, 5 July departure for St.
Croix.  So, we are presently planning on sticking to the originally planned,
scheduled departure on Wednesday, 5 July.  The C-130 and crew will overnight
in Miami, Florida on 5 July and will arrive in St. Croix on Thursday, 6 July.

All PELTI PIs and RAF staff traveling to St. Croix on the C-130 are asked to
note the following schedule for the departure on 5 July:
  7:00 a.m. -- All individuals traveling on C-130 must be at Jeffco w/
  personal baggage.  C-130 will be pulled from hangar at this time, and
  bags will then be loaded.
  7:45 a.m. -- Power on aircraft outside.
  8:45 a.m. -- Door close
  9:00 a.m. -- Takeoff
Henry Boynton has taken care of making hotel reservations in Miami for all
people traveling on the C-130.  However, everyone traveling on the aircraft
should have a credit card with them to use for paying for their individual
rooms upon checking in.

OTHER NOTES
-----------
As was discussed at the meeting today, we will still plan on packing up the
C-130 on the afternoon of Friday, 6/30.  Please have all of your boxes and
items (*not* personal baggage) to be shipped to St. Croix on the C-130 in the
hangar staging area by 1:00 p.m. tomorrow (Friday) afternoon.  Please make
sure that the weight of each box/item is written on the outside, along with
a brief description of the contents of the box.

I will be traveling to St. Croix commercially on Wednesday, 5 July to arrive
before the C-130 and take care of some business at the airport.  Thus, on the
morning of Wednesday, 5 July, please contact Dick Friesen if you have any last
minute questions or concerns.

Also, over the upcoming holiday weekend, I can be reached at home should
anyone need to discuss critical schedule changes or other important items
with me.  My home number is 303-828-9510.

That's all for now.  Please let me know if you have any questions on the
above.

Krista

All,

Included below is contact information for RAF staff who will be in the field
for PELTI: ( PELTI Deployment Dates:  5-26 July 2000)
  Chenay Bay Beach Resort
  Ph:  1-800-548-4457 or 340-773-2918
  Fax:  340-773-6665
RAF staff who will be in the field for PELTI (either for the duration of
the project or for short periods of time) are as follows:
  Krista Laursen
  Henry Boynton
  Ed Ringleman
  John Cusack
  Bob Olson
  Jim Nolan
  Kurt Zrubek
  George Nicoll
  Mike Spowart
  Chris Webster
Jeff Stith will be visiting the project from 6-14 July 2000 but will be
staying at The Buccaneer.  The phone numbers for that hotel are
(800)255-3881 or (340)773-2100.

RAF staff and the PELTI PIs will be sharing an office at the St. Croix
Airport.  We will have both a direct phone line and a fax line in this
office, but I presently do not have the numbers.  I will call or email
back to Jeffco with these two numbers once I have them.

At present, all shipments to RAF staff on the PELTI project should be
sent to the following address at the airport:
  PELTI Project
  ** U.S. GOVERNMENT, C/O BOHLKE **
  Bohlke International Airways (BIA)
  RR #2 Henry E. Rohlsen Airport
  St. Croix, USVI 00850
  
  Attn:  Dick Nackenhorst, BIA General Manager
  Ph:  340-778-9177

It is critical that you include the U.S. GOVERNMENT line on all shipments sent
to us in St. Croix.  This line will hopefully enable us to avoid having high
excise taxes tacked on to all of the shipment coming to us on the island.

Once I arrive, I will send back a shipping address for the hotel, should it
prove to be easier to send shipments to us there.  Also, please note that
express shipments can be sent to St. Croix using either FedEx or DHL.  Please
see either Patsy or Jason if you need help sending something to us in an
express shipment.

That's all for now.  I'll be in touch again once all of us have arrived
in St. Croix and we've got things up and running for the project.

See you all back here at Jeffco in a few weeks!

Krista

Status: RO

All,

Greetings from St. Croix!  I'm still working out some of the bugs in my
email connections back, so this message will probably be a bit brief.

The C-130 arrived this past Thursday, 7/6 at about 3:00 p.m. local time.
There were a couple of aircraft and RAF instrumentation problems to be dealt
with yesterday.  These included a need to re-wire part of the HF radio system
and a necessary repair to PLWC (one of the hot wire probes) on the C-130.
Mike Spowart completed repairs of the HF radio yesterday, and a radio check
was done with the pilots yesterday afternoon.  It is now operational again.
The IRS failed during the flight into St. Croix.  However, it was powered
up yesterday morning and aligned with no problems.  PLWC was also repaired
successfully by Kurt Zrubek yesterday.

There is no flight planned for today, as Barry Huebert's group and some of
the other PELTI PIs have work they wish to do on instrumentation prior to the
first flight.  Today, RAF staff are investigating a discrepancy between the
Tony Clarke FSSP-300 probe and the RAF FSSP-300.  At present, the Clarke probe
is showing concentrations much lower than the RAF 300 probe.  Also, suspicious
"gaps" are showing up in the size spectrums from the Clarke probe.  The plan
for today is to pull the Clarke probe from the C-130 and to perform some bench
tests and software (DMT versus RAF) comparisons of the Clarke probe here in
our office.  I'll forward along more information here as it becomes available.

That's about all for now.  Present plans call for a short research flight
tomorrow (Sun., 7/9) afternoon to "shake down" and test further some of the
instrumentation.

Most of us are staying at Chenay Bay Beach Resort.  It's a nice place with
individual cottages.  We have a nice view out over Green Cay Bay, outside
of Christiansted.

And the weather report:  hot and humid.  Something tells me that that's
going to be the weather report every day for the duration of the project.

That's all for now.  We're sharing email connection lines here and I need to
sign off for now and let someone else log on.  I'll be back in touch again
within the next few days after we've carried out the first one or two
research flights.

Best wishes to everyone back in Colorado (where, I understand, it's been
quite hot....but not humid).

Krista

All:
   Barry Huebert and Krista Laursen have passed the word that if things go
according to the current plan in St. Croix the C-130 would leave St. Croix
on Saturday, 7/22 to head for Jeffco with an expected arrival on Sunday.
   We will get another update before the weekend, but we should plan to move
the NASA C-130 off of the RAF ramp before the weekend so that there will be 
room for the NCAR C-130.

Subject: PELTI Status Update -- Friday, 7/21/00
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Length: 4184
Status: RO

All,

iy apologies to you all that these status reports have been so few and far
between these past couple of weeks.  However, email connections have been
sketchy at times, so my communications back have been somewhat limited.
At any rate, the C-130 is up flying the final PELTI research flight from
St. Croix right now, so I thought I'd take advantage of the temporary lull
in activity to send off one more status message before we get ready to tear
down and pack up our office.

I'm not going to go into all of the details of our return schedule to Jeffco
for this weekend, as I just noticed that Dick Friesen sent out copies of my
message to him about our scheduled return.  However, I do want to quickly
summarize where we are in terms of hours flown.  Here's how it looks:
   RF05 and RF06 (7/16/00) -- 5.2 hours flown
   RF07 (7/19/00) -- 5.2 hours flown

Note that two flight numbers are listed for 7/16/00.  On this date, an
approximately four-hour research flight was done, and then the C-130 landed
at Roosevelt Roads Naval Air Station in Puerto Rico to carry out a brief
visit with the PRIDE project staff working there.  This first research flight
was RF05.  RF06 corresponds to the short flight from Roosevelt Roads back to
St. Croix.

As of today, we have 5.8 research flight hours remaining.  I note here that
this number includes two additional research hours that were added to the
total following approval from Jeff Stith.  These two hours were needed to give
Barry Huebert and the other PELTI PIs enough flight time to complete all of
their stated LTI testing and aerosol-sampling goals.

RF07 proved to be a great success, with everyone's instruments (U. of
Hawaii, Drexel, and Princeton) working extremely well.  During this mission,
lower-level flight legs were first conducted to perform sea salt sampling.
Then, higher-level legs were executed to obtain samples in a dust layer that
had moved into the research area from Africa.  Today's mission (RF08) will
involve a flight pattern quite similar to that flown during RF07, and it's
expected that the PELTI investigators will obtain outstanding samples in the
dust layer.

RAF instrumentation continues to perform well with no major problems to
report.  The RAF and NASA FSSP-300 probes continue to agree fairly well, and
the bench-top bead calibrations that have been done between every flight have
shown that both probes have maintained calibration and alignment quite well.
(The NASA 300 probe has recently started showing some slippage in terms of
the bins in which beads show up during calibration, but this is not viewed
as a significant problem.)  Immediately following today's research flight,
RAF staff will remove the interior 300 probe (presently the RAF 300 probe)
and mount it on the right wing tip.  Thus, we will be flying all three 300
probes on the wings for the return trip to Jeffco.  This is being done at the
suggestion of Darrel Baumgardner to obtain some intercomparison data with all
probes out on the wings.

There is one minor problem to report from the aircraft end.  Ed Ringleman and
Henry Boynton report that the number 2 VHF radio is not functioning at 100%.
Apparently, the transmitted signal from this radio is somewhat weak and broken
up at receiving stations on the ground.  VHF radio #1 is, however, fully
operational, so that has been, and will continue to be, the primary VHF radio
used by the pilots.

The malfunctioning altimeter and the secondary altimeter both were replaced
earlier this week.  A company here at STX performed a pitot-static test of the
new units later on the same day, and both altimeters are now fully certified.

That's about all from here.  I'll be shutting down our phone and fax machine
here in the office at about 5:00 p.m. our time (3:00 p.m. in Colorado).  So,
if you need to reach us after that time, you can try calling us at Chenay Bay
Beach Resort or via Bohlke International Airways (340-778-9177).

Thanks to everyone back at Jeffco for all of your hard work and support
during this deployment.  We'll see you all back at the RAF on Monday!

Take care,

Krista

Subject: PELTI Status Report -- Saturday, 7/15/00
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Length: 9280
Status: RO

All,

My apologies for the delay in sending you a status report on how things are
going here in St. Croix.  However, the past several days since our arrival
have seen a fair amount of activity and work with the aircraft, and I just
couldn't seem to squeeze in the time to compose this report until now.  But
the C-130 is up in the air right now for research flight 4, so I thought I'd
finally send something off to everyone back at Jeffco and in ATD.

First, here's a look at where we stand in terms of hours flown.  The
allocation of hours for PELTI was as follows:
   Test flight hours --      4
   Ferry flight hours --    20
   Research flight hours -- 30
   ---------------------------
   Total flight hours --    54

As of this writing, 5.1 test flight hours have been flown and 10.9 ferry
hours have been flown.  The following research hours have so far been flown:
   RF01, actually ferry from Miami to St. Croix (7/6/00) -- 4.7
   RF02 (7/9/00) -- 3.1
   RF03 (7/11/00) -- 5.3
Thus, as of today, we have flown 8.4 research hours.

To determine how many research hours remain, the pilots (Henry and Ed) and
I have agreed to subtract the test, ferry, and research hours flown from the
total hours awarded for the project (54).  We have also held in reserve 10
ferry hours for the trip home.  Thus, we presently have 19.6 hours remaining
for research flights.

In general, the aircraft and instrumentation are performing well so far.
There have been a few issues to deal with, which I outline briefly below:

1)  During ferry of the aircraft to St. Croix, the secondary RAIDS disk in the
   C-130 data system failed.  After performing the first two research flights
   without this backup disk, it was decided by RAF staff that it would be
   better to take the time to install and configure the new RAIDS disk sent
   to us here in St. Croix by RAF staff.  This task was completed yesterday
   morning, and hercules (the RAF data system) is back up and running with
   both RAIDS disks on-line.
2)  Several problems have been encountered with the FSSP-300 probes being
   flown on the aircraft.  The first problem noticed during ferry was that the
   T. Clarke probe being flown on the right wing pod was not working properly
   and was indicating counts much lower than the RAF FSSP-300 (flown on the
   left wing) and the T. Strawa 300 probe (flown in the cabin).  The Clarke
   probe was removed from the aircraft several days ago, and during the
   course of working with the instrument on the bench here in our office,
   the instrument went out of alignment.  A few days ago, one of Barry
   Huebert's group members was able to re-align and clean the instrument and
   successfully performed a bead calibration of the probe.  The Clarke probe
   is now back on the aircraft, and we will know after today's flight how it
   is performing.
    A few other problems have been encountered with the RAF and Strawa
   FSSP-300 probes.  Most notably, it was detected early on that the data
   from the two probes differed significantly in terms of the number of counts
   registered in each channel.  Jeff Stith, Chris Webster, Mike Spowart,
   and the RAF techs spent several days trouble-shooting not only the probes
   but the RAF data recording software.  Some changes have been made to
   the RAF processing routines, but it was also determined that part of the
   discrepancy between the two probes stems from the difficulty in determining
   the flow rate (and hence the "true airspeed") through the probe mounted
   in the cabin of the aircraft.  Steve Howell found a problem with the flow
   meter being used in conjunction with the cabin-mounted probe (a good,
   stable calibration could not be obtained for this meter), and he swapped in
   another flow meter prior to today's flight.  After all the work of the past
   several days, the spectra obtained from the RAF and Strawa 300 probes are
   now in much better agreement.  However, the one lingering discrepancy has
   to do with the fact that the internally-mounted 300 probe consistently
   measures lower counts than the 300 probe mounted out on the wing.  Between
   RF02 and RF03, the RAF and Strawa probes were swapped (RAF in the cabin and
   Strawa on the left wing pod) to see if the problem moved with the probes.
   However, the resulting flight data indicated that this undercounting
   problem stays with the location and occurs with whatever probe is mounted
   in the cabin.  We will likely be continuing the swap the RAF and Strawa
   probes between each research flight, and we will continue to consider
   what might be causing the undercounting with the interior probe.
3)  It was determined during the early flights that the unmodified and
   modified RAF FSSP-100 probes being flown on the aircraft yielded data that
   were not in agreement.  Jeff Stith spent a considerable amount of time
   working with Chris Webster on this problem, and several changes were made
   by Chris to his FSSP-100 processing routines.  Data obtained from the two
   100 probes now display much better agreement.
4)  During the ferry flights out here, it was determined that the Lyman-Alpha
   being flown on the aircraft was not yielding very good data.  The problem
   was determined to be incorrect calibration coefficientss and a need
   to decrease the physical path length of the instrument.  George Nicoll
   decreased the path length of the Lyman-Alpha from 0.5 and 0.25, and Allen
   Schanot worked up new cal. coes. to be used with the instrument.  Both of
   these steps have resulted in Lyman-Alpha data of much better quality.
5)  During the first few flights, problems were encountered with both PLWC and
   PLWC2 (the latter being the "test" King probe being flown on the left wing
   pod).  Both probes have since been repaired, and now all three King probes
   are back on-line.
6)  A couple of problems have recently been detected with some of the data
   channels being recorded on ADS.  First, it was discovered by Don Thornton
   and Glenn Mitchell of Drexel that the two 50 Hz digital signals from their
   APIMS system that are being recorded on ADS show periodic signal dropouts.
   Specifically, these brief (few seconds) periods of signal flattening happen
   about every 10 minutes or so.  Mike Spowart is still looking into this
   problem and, as of today's flight, has not been able to find the cause.
   Don Thornton does not see this problem as a show-stopper, however, but
   we will nevertheless continue to try to solve this.  The second problem
   related to eight analog channels being recorded on the AFT DSM.  Lynn
   Russell and George Nicoll discovered during RF03 that several of Lynn's
   variables and the RAF variable INFLOW would (apparently spontaneously)
   drop approximately 0.5 volts and then would later jump back up 0.5 volts.
   I later determined that one of Jim Anderson's variables also displays the
   same behavior.  None of the RAF or other variables recorded on the AFT DSM
   have so far shown this problem.  We have ruled out RAF 60 Hz power as the
   source of the problem, and the swapping in of a new DSP card in the aft DSM
   did not solve the problem, either.  (Lynn and I saw the problem again on
   the ground yesterday.)  We have so far been able to "cause" the voltage
   drops and increases by cycling power on the aft DSM.  However, this test is
   not repeatable, as one can cycle power several more times and not see the
   same jump or drop.  Mike Spowart and Kurt Zrubek have found some signal
   wiring from Lynn's equipment that needs to be re-done and may be causing
   the voltage drops to "spread" to some of her affected variables.  However,
   at this point, we are still not sure of the cause of all of this.  Lynn's
   affected signals are all being used for housekeeping purposes, so she is
   not too worried about the effect on her data.  Nevertheless, RAF staff
   will continue to work to figure out what might be causing this particular
   problem.

That's about all for now.  We seem to have hit a bit of a lull in terms of
the presence of dust plumes from Africa.  The C-130 and crew are performing a
sea-salt case study today and will also hopefully be getting in a leg to study
some dust.  However, it could be a few more days before another significant
dust event moves into this area.

As for the weather here, well, it's hot and humid.  (Surprise, surprise!)
However, there's a fairly regular breeze that blows around here in the
mornings, and that helps to keep things cool on the aircraft while folks are
working on the ground.  The air conditioners and generator arrived from Jeffco
yesterday, but we've determined that we can only run one air conditioner at
a time on the generator.  This does seem to help lower the cabin temperature,
though, and combined with the large fans we're using, the cabin is kept
somewhat comfortable.

Those of us who also recently spent time up north in Churchill and/or Thule
have been remarking about the diametrically opposed climate down here.  We've
definitely gone from one extreme to another in a fairly short period of time.
I think perhaps the jury is still out in terms of which environment (tropical
or arctic) is preferred.  Personally, I must admit that it's been nice to
trade in my TOPSE work attire of parka, Sorels, wind pants, and balaclava for
shorts, t-shirts, and baseball cap.  But hey, that's just me.

I hope all is well back in Colorado with all of you.  I'll be back in touch
again in a few more days.

Krista

Subject: PELTI Final Data Processing and Release
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Status: RO

All,

Hopefully you each had safe trips back to your home institutions.  Man, it
seems a lot quieter around here at Jeffco these days.  Well, okay, not really.
Now we're working on simultaneously getting both the Electra and C-130 ready
and out the door for mid-August field projects.

I wanted to email all of you with some information and a request regarding
final processing of the PELTI C-130 data set.  First, I wanted to let you know
that I am hoping to begin the final processing of the data later this week or
early next.  It is presently my goal to have the data processed and released
by the end of August.  Of course, should any of you need any data products
prior to this final release, let me know, and I'll see about accommodating
your request(s) as soon as I can.  Please note that final documentation (file
names and times, data quality summary, etc.) to accompany the data set will
also be prepared and released.  The RAF has recently begun posting these final
documentation materials on the Web.  Ron Ruth, the RAF data manager, and I
will be working on putting these Web materials together over the coming weeks.
I hope to have the project documentation available on-line by the end of
August, also.  However, I'll keep you all updated as to the anticipated
release date for the documentation.  Also, I'll let you all know where to
access these materials on-line once they are made available.

In order to complete final processing of the data set, I need to have in hand
all final calibration coefficients needed to correctly process the data.  So,
for those of you who recorded signals on the RAF data system during PELTI,
should you have any new calibration coefficients that you would like to be
used in the processing, please get these calibration coefficients to me by
Friday, 11 August at the absolute latest.

Last, I believe you are all aware that forward-, downward-, and side-looking
videos were all recorded on each flight during PELTI.  A few of you inquired
with me earlier about the possibility of obtaining copies of these videotapes
after the project.  After I have finished documenting the video tape times,
I will be turning the original videotapes over to Barry Huebert.  However,
should any of you have an interest in obtaining copies of some of the
videotapes, please email me (with a copy to Barry), and Barry and I can
together work out a plan for getting tape copies made as needed.

That's all for now.  Please feel free to email me should you have any
questions on the above.  I'll be in touch again soon as more information
becomes available regarding the final PELTI data set and documentation.

Best regards,

Krista

Subject: Preliminary PELTI Data Files
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Length: 3024
Status: ROr

All,

At the request of a few of you, I have made available the preliminary PELTI
C-130 data files.  These are the netCDF files generated while in the field.
(Some were also generated immediately after our return to Jeffco.)  These
files are available via ftp here on our system at the RAF.

To access the netCDF files, do the following:
  1) ftp raf.atd.ucar.edu;
  2) Log on as "anonymous" and enter your full email address as the password;
  3) cd pub/tmp/sheba;
  4) Enter "bi" to enter binary transfer mode.
  5) Use "get [filename]" to get each file that you're interested in.

A few notes regarding these preliminary files.  First, as is stamped in
the header block of each netCDF file, these data files are *preliminary*.
Consequently, the RAF asks that they not be used for critical analyses and
that the data not be used in publications.  Second, the RAF will ask that,
once the final netCDF data files become available, each PI destroy any copies
of preliminary files he/she may have in his/her possession.  This latter
policy will hopefully avoid any problems caused by erroneous files winding
up in circulation.

I also wanted to pass along a couple of notes regarding the numbers and names
of a few of the files.  First, you will all recall that the flights flown on
7/16/00 were broken up into two data files, RF05 and RF06.  RF05 corresponds
to the research flight done prior to landing at Roosevelt Roads, and RF06
corresponds to the short research leg done on the trip back to St. Croix.
I have decided to keep this naming/numbering convention (rather than renaming
them RF05a and RF05b) in an effort to avoid confusion regarding the file
names.  However, I have made a change to two of the last research flights.
You will recall that, during RF08 on 7/21/00, the RAF experienced problems
with the data system that resulted in two data files being written.  These
were originally labelled RF08 and RF09.  You may also recall that I determined
that a good portion of the data from these two flights was missing from the
removable hard drives.  I have since been able to recover almost all of the
data from the Exabyte tapes recorded during that flight.  As a result, I have
renamed the two raw data files to RF08a and RF08b and have processed all of
the data collected on 7/21/00 into one netCDF file, 186rf08.cdf.  This is the
netCDF file you will find in the public ftp directory referred to above.  As
a result of this 7/21 numbering change, I have also re-numbered the research
flight (from St. Croix to Miami) on 7/22/00 from RF10a and RF10b to RF09a and
RF09b.  Thus, the 7/22/00 research flight is now 186rf09.cdf in the public ftp
directory and will also be numbered as such in the final, released data set.

One last item.  The flight flown from Miami to Jeffco on 7/23/00 has been
labelled as FF02 by the RAF.  The netCDF file for this flight is thus
186ff02.cdf in the public ftp directory.

Hopefully the above won't be confusing to any of you.  Please let me know if
you have any questions.

Krista

Krista,

Have you also edited the ADS headers in the disk files to reflect the flight
number changes?  If not, then when NIMBUS is run on them (especially in
production mode), they will regain their original flight numbers.  If you
have, I'd like to archive the tape images with the "correct" flight numbers
so they can be retrieved instead of the originals.  (I want to archive all
the master disk files, too.)

How do you want me to handle the MSS bitfile names I have given the tapes?
They now have the original naming convention.  See the file:
     /jnet/shared/proj/186/Production/archive/tapes.186
Their headers won't conform, but I certainly can rename them to correspond
to your new scheme.

It would be good to can maintain consistency throughout.

Nope, haven't had the time yet to change the ADS headers.  I'll do this as I get
time this week.  Please do not archive the ADS images until you hear from me
that everything is in order.

Ron,

I've put a "*" by the files you list below to indicate the ones I'll be using for
production processing.  Note that the only one I won't be using is 186ff02a.ads.

By the way, you can go ahead and send the indicated files up to the MSS for
archiving.  I've gone ahead and checked and changed the ADS file headers as
needed.

Krista

Ron,

I need to make an addendum to my last message.

I just noticed that there are three ADS images for TF02 in
/jnet/data/pelti:

186tf02.ads
186tf02a.ads
186tf02b.ads

I don't know where the last two came from (they have Chris' name on
them), but only archive 186tf02.ads.

Thanks, and let me know if you have any questions.

Krista

Subject: Removal of an Archived PELTI ADS Image
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Status: ROr

Hi Ron,

I was just doing some preliminary processing of the PELTI data, and I
discovered something about one of the PELTI ADS images in
/jnet/data/pelti.  In working with the RF04 data, I discovered that the
ADS image "186rf04a.ads" in /jnet/data/pelti begins with a time of
00:00:00.  This image also did not have a correct date in the ADS
header, which I changed.  However, I won't be using this a.ads image in
processing and will instead only be using 186rf04b.ads and 186rf04c.ads
for processing of RF04.

Can you please not archive 186rf04b.ads to the MSS, or if you have
already, can you remove it from the MSS?  This will hopefully avoid any
confusion down the road.

Thanks.

Krista

Krista,

In the first paragraph you mentioned using 186rf04b.ads for your processing,
but in the second paragraph you want me to not archive it.  I assume that you
really want me to remove the tiny file 186rf04a.ads (230412 bytes).  The file
186rf04b.ads is very small, too (673932 bytes), but I would guess it has data
you want.

Please verify.  Thanks.

Ron

Krista,

The MSS bitfile /RAF/2000/186/ADS/RF04A (equivalent to 186rf04a.ads)
has been removed.

Yikes!  That was a definite typo on my part, Ron.

To verify, I'll only be using 186rf04b.ads and 186rf04c.ads in processing.
Please remove 186rf04a.ads (the small ADS image) from the MSS, if you've already
archived it.

Thanks so much for catching this!

Krista

Ron,

There's an additional "nuance" in regard to the PELTI data processing
and archival that I need your help with.

The TECO ozone monitor was deployed on the C-130 for the project, and
Teresa has had to do some skel processing of the ozone data to correctly
output the data.  She has completed this skel processing, and the
resultant files are in her /tmp directory and are ready to be archived
to the MSS.  Note that these files are only subset files and contain
only the correctly processed ozone data.

Can you go ahead and archive these files to the MSS?  They are located
in /jnet/tmp/campos and have the following name convention:

186XXXX.o3.cdf,

where XXXX is the flight number (e.g., tf01, rf02, etc.).

I am presently working on the QC of the main (but unmerged) netCDF
files.  Once I have this QC work complete, I will let you know and will
ask you to also archive these files to the MSS.  Once those files are
archived, I will merge Teresa's ozone files into the main netCDF files
to generate the final PELTI data files.  Then, obviously, those files
can be sent up to the MSS.

Let me know what the ozone files have been archived.  And, likewise,
I'll let you know when the main netCDF files are ready to go up.

Thanks!

Krista

Ron,

The skel source code used to generate the *.o3.cdf subset files are also in
my /tmp directory.  I'd be grateful if you would also archive these, so
that if needed, we can regenerate the data at some future date.  

Thanks,

Teresa

Teresa,

I copied all the files and put them temporarily in an O3 subdirectory in the
project's Production subdirectory.  That space gets backed up regularly, and
I will archive all the support files to the SCD Mass Store System when Krista
is finished with production and her documentation.

Hi Ron,

I have another batch of PELTI netCDF files ready for archival on the
MSS.

In /jnet/productiondata, you will find the "main" netCDF files for this
project.  I call these the "main" files because they will not be final
until I've merged in Teresa's ozone files.  Can you please go ahead and
archived the files presently in /jnet/productiondata to a directory on
the MSS?  I want to have these files archived and saved before I proceed
with merging in the ozone netCDF files.

Please send me an email message after archival of the above files is
complete, and I will then proceed with the merging and the creation of
the final PELTI netCDF files.

Thanks!

Krista

Hi Ron,

Okay, I've completed merging Teresa's ozone files into the "main" PELTI
netCDF files, and the final files are now ready for archival to the
MSS.  I also have one other file that I need you to archive.

When trying to merge the ozone file for RF01 into the main data file for
the flight, I encountered an error message that there were no
overlapping time segments and thus no merging would be done.  The time
segments in the two files were identical, so that wasn't the problem.
At any rate, I re-ran Teresa's skel program in /jnet/tmp/campos and
regenerated the ozone file for RF01.  I was able to successfully merge
this new ozone file into the main data file.  Don't ask me what the
problem was....I'm not sure.  I've seen this happen before but have
never traced down the source of the problem.  (Something funky in one of
the netCDF global data blocks, I suspect.)

At any rate, all of the final netCDF files in /jnet/productiondata are
now ready to go up to the MSS.  Can you go ahead and send them and let
me know when this process is complete?

Also, I want to send an email message out to the PELTI PIs to let them
know that the final low rate data files are ready.  In this message, I
would like to give them instructions for where on the RAF data system
they can go to get copies of the final files via ftp.  Where are we
presently storing final netCDF data files on mistral for ftp retrieval?

Thanks, in advance, for your help on the above.

Krista

Okay, I'm a space cadet, I guess.

I forgot to mention the critical point in my last message, Ron, that I need
you to remove the 186rf01.o3.cdf file presently archived on the MSS and, in
its place, archive the *new* 186rf01.o3.cdf file in /jnet/tmp/campos.

Sorry about the omission on my part.

Krista

Krista,

I dug up enough room to put these files on our anonymous ftp space.  This
morning only about 500MB were available, so I removed some that haven't
been accessed for awhile.

I am putting the files in the following ftp directory:
        pub/projects/PELTI/

They should be there before 6:00 p.m. today.

Here's the lowdown on outside access:

Krista,

I tried to generate a taplog.186 file for PELTI, but my script died.
Seems with the latest "nimbus" release, a "UTC" field has been added
at the end.  This tripped up my script.  I'll be fixing it tomorrow.

I had hoped to include a log in the PELIT ftp directory.  It should
be there sometime tomorrow.

Thanks, Ron.

RE my previous inquiry regarding where the PELTI PIs can get these files via
ftp, where should I tell them to "ftp to" to get the files on mistral?  I need
to email this information out tomorrow (Wed., 8/30).

Thx.

Krista

All,

I have completed final processing of the low rate (1 sample per second, or sps)
PELTI C-130 data files.  The final project data files are now available via ftp
here on the RAF server.  Following is information regarding how to retrieve
copies of the files:

Several of you may already have in your possession copies of the preliminary
netCDF data files prepared in the field.  Per my earlier notification to all of
you, I ask that you now destroy all of your preliminary file copies and replace
them with copies of the final production files now available from the RAF.

Ron Ruth, the RAF data manager, and I are still working on completing the final
project documentation for PELTI.  As I believe I mentioned to you all
previously, the RAF now distributes all project documentation via the Web.  I
anticipate that the Web documentation for PELTI will be ready within the next
two to three weeks, and I will send you all an email message listing the URL
for the Web site once the materials are made available.

The above project documentation will include a full project data quality
analysis report.  However, since several of you will likely begin working with
the final data files prior to the release of the documentation, I wanted to
pass along some notes regarding the final processing and some data quality
issues at this time.  Please be aware that the brief data quality discussion I
include below is *not* meant to be exhaustive and may not necessarily include
all of the pertinent items which might appear in the formal data quality
report.

Final Processing and Data Quality Notes
-----------------------------------------

1)  In general, you will probably notice that the final netCDF data files are
not significantly different in content from the preliminary data files.  I did,
however, make a few changes during production processing which I feel have
improved the overall quality of the data set.  Two changes to be noted are as
follows:

a) Designation of ATX (Reference ambient temperature) -- In all of the
preliminary data files, ATX was set to equal ATRL, the radome left temp. sensor
measurement.  During post-project analysis of the data, I determined that ATRR
(the radome right temp. sensor) gave slightly better ambient temp. measurements
for several of the research flights.  So, please note that for TF01, TF02,
FF01, and RF01, ATX is ATRL.  However, for the remaining project flights, ATX
is set to ATRR.  For those of you who have been using ATX in some of your
calculations, this change to ATRR should not make a significant difference.
ATRL and ATRR, in general, tracked extremely well for the whole project and
were in very good agreement.  I simply felt that ATRR yielded slightly better
data for the later flights.

b) During final processing, I switched to using the humidity-corrected true
airspeed (variable TASHC) in processing of the wind data and the 1D probe
data.  In dry conditions, TASHC only differs from TASX (the reference true
airspeed, for PELTI, the radome true airspeed, or TASR) by a few hundredths of
a mbar.  However, during the flights in Miami and St. Croix, TASHC differed
from TASX in some cases by a few tenths of a mbar.  Thus, I felt it was
important to switch to using TASHC during the processing of the research flight
data.  In fact, I used TASHC in the processing for all of the project flights.
However, in the case of the test flights here in Colorado, the resultant data
were not significantly different from the preliminary data.  For those of you
who have been using TASX in your calculations and/or have been looking at the
1D probe data, please be advised that this switch to the use of TASHC does not
have a significant impact on the final processed data.  In the case of the 1D
probe data, this processing switch resulted in changes of something on the
order of a couple of percentage points.

2)  Internal (cabin) FSSP-300 data -- As Steve Howell pointed out previously,
calibration of the flowmeter used to measure the flow rate through the cabin
300 probe yielded poor calibration coefficients through RF03.  Thus, the flow
rate data (variable LFSSPF) and the cabin 300 probe data should be viewed as
highly questionable for TF01, TF02, FF01, and RF01-03.

3)  Regarding the FSSP-300 probes flown outside the aircraft and the one flown
inside the cabin, I wanted to pass along information regarding which was where
for which flight.  Please note the following:

LPO = Left Pod, Outboard
WDR = Window, Right (Cabin)
RPO = Right Pod, Outboard

For all flights -- RPO = Tony Clarke's DMT Modified Probe
  ** Note:  probe was off for RF02 and RF03, so no data these two flights. **

TF01-RF02:  LPO = RAF 300 probe; WDR = NASA 300 probe
RF03:  LPO = NASA 300 probe; WDR = RAF 300 probe
RF04:  LPO = RAF 300 probe; WDR = NASA 300 probe
RF05:  LPO = NASA 300 probe; WDR = RAF 300 probe
RF06:  LPO = NASA 300 probe; WDR = RAF 300 probe
RF07:  LPO = RAF 300 probe; WDR = NASA 300 probe
RF08:  LPO = NASA 300 probe; WDR = RAF 300 probe
RF09 and FF02:  WDR = RAF 300 probe
  ** However, note that the RAF 300 probe was actually flown out on the right
wing tip of the C-130 for the final two flights.  Thus, while the data still
appear with the "_WDR" suffix in the RF09 and FF02 data files, they actually
correspond to right wing tip data.

** One other important note must be made about RF03.  The data system header
was incorrectly changed on the aircraft prior to the flight.  This problem was
addressed in processing.  However, users should be aware that the 300 probe
data labelled with "_WDR" in the RF03 file are actually LPO (left pod outboard)
data, and the data labelled "_LPO" are actually WDR (cabin) 300 probe data.

As of this writing, I have not done a complete quality analysis of the Clarke
probe (RPO) data.  However, based on optical alignment problems in the field
and known missing bins in the collected data, it is my opinion that the RPO
FSSP-300 data collected during PELTI should be viewed as highly questionable.

4)  Due to changes in how the military distributes the "lower quality" GPS data
signal, the GPS altitude data (variable GALT) recorded on the C-130 is now much
improved in quality (almost no spiking now, etc.).  Thus, I have gone ahead and
distributed GALT data in the final PELT data files.  Pressure altitude (PALT)
and geometric height (HGM232) data are also available.  Users should be aware
that, at low altitudes, PALT often yields unusable (negative) values.  Thus, it
is recommended that HGM232 data be used for measurements of height at low
altitudes.


Those are all of the points I can think of at present.  More detailed data
quality information will be included in the forthcoming final quality report.

Also, I wanted to mention that I will be generating high rate data files for
the PELTI flights.  I anticipate starting on that work within about the next
week and will notify you all when those files are ready.

Should you require any assistance retrieving copies of the final low rate data
files, or should you wish to inquire about obtaining copies of the data files
on another media, please contact Ron Ruth (the RAF data manager) at
303-497-1084 or ruth@ucar.edu.  Should you have any questions or comments about
the data, please contact me directly (303-497-1031 or krista@ucar.edu).

And as always, please do not hesitate to contact me if I or anyone else here at
the RAF can by of further assistance.

Best regards,

Krista

Ron,

I thought I'd go ahead and copy the PELTI flight scientist reports (from
Barry Huebert) over to mistral for you before I forgot.

In the subdirectory "pelti_reports" of my main directory on mistral
(~krista), you'll find the Word documents prepared by Barry.  Please go
ahead and grab copies of these documents and make them available via the
RAF PELTI Web site.

Thanks.

Krista

Subject: **IMPORTANT -- PELTI Re-processing Notification**
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Length: 1332
Status: RO

All,

In putting together the final data quality report for the PELTI C-130
data set, I discovered today that some processing parameters were set up
incorrectly for two of the FSSP-300 probes flown on the aircraft.
(Basically, some changes were made recently to the processing routines
that didn't get transferred over to the files used to process the PELTI
data.)  I am presently working out with Chris Webster what needs to be
changed, and I will very shortly begin re-processing the PELTI low-rate
netCDF files.

Once these files have been re-generated, I will have Ron Ruth transfer
them to the ftp directory here and I will send out an email notification
to all of you that the re-processing is complete.  At that time, I will
ask you to destroy the copies of the final production files that you
presently have and to replace them with the new copies.  I will also
have Ron Ruth re-archive the new (correct) files on the Mass Store
System here at NCAR.

It should not take very long for me to re-process the files.  I
anticipate that this task can be completed in a day or less.  So, I hope
to notify you all shortly that this work has been completed.

I sincerely apologize for any confusion or inconvenience this error may
cause any of you.  Please contact me here at the RAF if you have any
questions.

Thank you.

Krista

Ron,

Earlier today, Barry Huebert sent me two Adobe PDF files containing a
summary and some figures for his recently completed study of the LTI
(low turbulence inlet).  Barry has given his permission for these two
items to be included in the RAF PELTI documentation Web site.  I have
placed copies of the two files -- called "PELTISummary_11_Sept.pdf" and
"SummaryFigsAll.pdf" -- in my directory //h/9/krista/pelti_reports.

I have a special request regarding these two documents, however.  I
would like to ask that you *not* convert the contents over to HTML prior
making them available on our Web site.  The reason for this is that a
lot of critical formatting and information in the figures will become
lost if you do so.  So, can you please list links to these two documents
in the PELTI Web site and let users download the two documents
themselves?  I think that would be best.

Let me know if you have any questions on the above or if you see any
problems.

Thanks.

Krista

Krista,

I just tried to retrieve the PDF files from your "pelti_reports" subdirectory,
but the permissions are not set for me to do that.  When available, I will
transfer them, as is, to the web site.  I agree that they should not be
changed, since most browsers have pdf plugins or can get the free software
to view them.

Sorry about that, Ron.  I keep forgetting that when I copy files from my PC to
mistral, the file permissions get changed so that only I have read/write

Hi Ron,

Okay, let's try this again.

I've finished re-generating the "first run" main netCDF files for
PELTI.  Remember that these are the ones that do not yet have Teresa's
corrected ozone data merged in.  These main files are sitting in
/jnet/productiondata and are ready for archival to the MSS.

Can you please archive all of the 186 .cdf files in
/jnet/productiondata?  Please let me know when you've completed doing
this, and I'll then merge in the ozone files to create the new final
netCDF files.

Thanks!

Krista

Krista,

I have archived to the SCD Mass Store System the "first run" netCDF files
that you requested.  You may now merge in Teresa's skeleton files.

Krista,

I copied and massaged (with "xv") the PELTI digital camera pictures that Dick
Friesen has in his home directory to prepare them for the web site.  When
totally finished they will appear in a few directories depending upon usage:
  poststamp - postage-stamp size images for a gallery page [click to get a
               larger image].  I'm planning two virtually-identical gallery
               pages like I did for INDOEX, one for "small" and one for
               "hires.")
  small     - images sized (and rotated, if necessary) for a typical
               web browser
  hires     - giant high resolution images (most "original, but some modified
               for brightness, clarity and/or rotation)
  original  - unaltered giant images (These will not stay at the web
               site but will be copied into the project's Production/docs
               subdirectory.)
  rotated   - original images rotated 90-degrees using "xv" to make them
               right-side-up (These will not stay at the web site but will
               be copied into the project's Production/docs subdirectory.)

The images in "original," "rotated," "poststamp" and "small" are finished
and ready for viewing.  (I still am populating the "hires" directory.)
At least one of the photos is a duplicate, and you may choose not to include
others.  (Please let me know which images you want to include on the web
site.)  All photos will need a caption for the web, and if you don't like
their file names, you are welcome to give me substitutes, and I will rename
them.  (The only reason for doing this is that a photo's file name will be
"suggested" to anyone who wants to download it to his/her own site.) 

The subdirectories liseted above can be found in the web directory:
     /jnet/http/htdocs/Projects/PELTI/pics/

Here is a table of all the picture files which, if you want, you can use
as a template for your reply.

Original                  Include  New                 Caption (can be as
file name                   Y/N    file name            long as you like)

Okay, thanks.

I've placed a copy of the Word file containing the PELTI documentation cover
letter in ~krista/pelti_reports.  The file name is "pelti_covlett.doc", and
I've changed the read/write permissions so that you shouldn't have any problem
accessing it.

I'll let you know when the merged netCDF files are ready.

Ron,

I've finished merging the ozone files into the main PELTI netCDF files.
So, the 186 netCDF files in /jnet/productiondata data are now final and
can be re-archived to the MSS.  Also, can you please copy these new
final files to the anonymous ftp directory so that users can access
them?  Please let me know when both the MSS archival and the copying to
the ftp directory are complete, and I'll send an email message out to
the PELTI PIs to let them know that the files are now available again.

Thanks!

Krista

Hi Ron,

I've made available some additional PELTI digital pictures for
presenatation on the PELTI documentation site.  (These are in addition
to the ones that Dick Friesen already made available to you.)  All of
the JPEG files I refer to below are in the directory pelti_reports in
~/krista on mistral.

Here are the file names and picture captions:

c130_pic1.jpg -- C-130 on the ramp at the St. Croix airport
c130_pic2.jpg -- Same caption as for c130_pic1.jpg
c130_pic3.jpg -- Same caption as for c130_pic1.jpg and c130_pic2.jpg
c130ramp.jpg -- View of C-130 and ramp at St. Croix airport
bia.jpg -- View of Bohlke International Airways (BIA) hangars at St.
Croix airport
stxramp.jpg -- View of St. Croix airport ramp section and taxiways
fdeck.jpg -- Partial view of C-130 flight deck

I've changed all of the read/write permissions on the above files, so
you shouldn't have any trouble accessing them.

Thanks!

Krista

Hi Ron,

I wanted to check in with you to see if you've archived the new PELTI
netCDF files to the MSS and to the public ftp directory?  I would like
to notify the PELTI PIs as soon as possible that the new, re-generated
files are ready.

Also, I wanted to let you know that I've put together captions for the
digital PELTI pix taken by Dick F. and will be emailing those to you
tomorrow.  Also, I'm almost done with the instrumentation list and the
data quality report and anticipate getting both of those to you by
Thursday at the latest.  So, I think all of the PELTI documentation
materials will be in your hands by Thursday.

Thanks.

Krista

Dear Ron:

Because the final TOPSE data is due early next month. I need it in a rush.
If I just need total FSSP concentration or liquid/ice water concentration
(better if you have the latter), the file will be much smaller. I don't 
want the size distribution data. And can you put just that kind of data on
a ftp site that I can download from?

Thank you very much.

Late yesterday afternoon I was able to get all the PELTI files put on the
ftp site.  I also archived them to the MSS.  Sorry I didn't let you know.

I will convert the documentation files when I receive them.

Hi Ron,

I've gone through the PELTI digital pictures taken by Dick F., and
following is information regarding which images to omit, file name
changes to make, and captions.

First off, here are the names of the images which I don't want included
in the documentation:

Bandy.aft.2.jpg
Bandy.forward.jpg
Clarke.inlet3.jpg
Huebert.aft.jpg
Huebert.forward.jpg
laser.hyg.left.jpg
laser.hyg.side.jpg
pumps.aft.jpg


Second, here are a couple of file name changes that are needed:

leftpod.jpg -- Change to rightpod.jpg
rightpod.jpg -- Change to leftpod.jpg

Okay, now for the "meat and potatoes."  Here are captions for each of
the remaining (i.e., not removed) images to be included in the
documentation:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

rack, showing pump mount.

CAI.inlet.jpg:  CAI manifold with attached plumbing; forward cabin,
right side.

CAI.inlet1.jpg:  CAI manifold with attached plumbing; forward cabin,
right side; 2nd view.

Clarke.inlet.jpg:  Clarke shrouded solid-diffuser/curved-tube (SD) inlet
(top) and Drexel Univ. APIMS and GC/MS inlets (bottom); forward
fuselage, left side.

Clarke.inlet1.jpg:  Clarke shrouded solid-diffuser/curved-tube (SD)

No problem, Ron.

Actually, I might need to make a couple of small changes to two of the
captions.  I'm waiting on some info. from Barry Huebert regarding what
instruments were where in his two racks.  I'll let you know as soon as
possible of any changes.

Krista,

The PELTI data are now present on our ftp site which is now 81% full.

The
   ~ftp/pub/projects/PELTI/README
file has been updated and has a modified taplog.186 file with ftp file
names appended to each entry.

I hope to have in place within the next few weeks (dependent on RDP's
participation) a means for dynamically serving up data files from the MSS to
requestors.  (S/he would click on a table entry on a project's web page just
as is done now but would then fill out a short form that includes an email
address.  The data would be retrieved, and when ready an email would be sent
informing the requstor that the file is ready.  Clicking on the link in the
email message would download it.)

Once in place, we could make most of our data sets available.  I think it
would be a great step forward.  I would think that this retrieval system
also could be made to work with ION for dynamic display of our data, once
we get ION in place.

Subject: Re-Release of PELTI Low Rate netCDF Data Files
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Length: 3861
Status: RO

All,

I have finished the re-processing of the low rate (1 sample per second)
netCDF data files for PELTI.  These files have been re-archived to the
NCAR Mass Store System (MSS) and are now also available again on the ftp
site here at the RAF.

So that you all have an understanding of why it was necessary for me to
re-process the PELTI data, let me explain briefly what was done.  In
performing another review of some of the netCDF data files a few days
ago (I'd reviewed all of the files about three times prior to the first
release), I discovered -- along with Chris Webster -- that the first and
last bin settings should be adjusted slightly for the RAF FSSP-300 and
NASA FSSP-300 probes and the RAF DMT-modified FSSP-100.  Basically,
these first and last bin settings refer to the bin cell sizes at which
all RAF calculations involving the FSSP probe data start and end.
Adjusting the first bin setting, for example, enables us to eliminate
noise in a channel at a smaller cell size value, should we consider it
necessary to do so.  These adjustments to the first and last bin
settings did not (as some of you might note) make significant changes to
the resulting 100 and 300 probe data.  The other change that needed to
be made was a bit more significant and involved the processing of the
Clarke DMT-modified FSSP-300 data for flights RF04-09 and FF02.  While
examining some of the netCDF file headers, Chris Webster and I
discovered that the number of channels at which the Clarke probe was
operated had been decreased from 41 to 31 as of RF04.  This change
required that several of the latter PELTI flights be re-processed in
order to accommodate a corresponding change in the cell sizes for the
Clarke probe.  All of the above changes were, obviously, made prior to
the re-processing and release of the new low rate netCDF files.

To reiterate the statement made in my previous email message announcing
the need to re-process the data, I ask that each of you destroy all
copies of the previous netCDF files that you have in your possession and
that you download the new files from the RAF site.  This will help to
insure that only the correct netCDF files remain in circulation.

Here are the instructions for obtaining the netCDF files from the RAF,
should any of you require these instructions again:

1)  Log on to the RAF site using "ftp raf.atd.ucar.edu";
2)  Enter "anonymous" as the login and enter your full email address as
the password;
3)  To change to the correct directory, enter "cd pub/projects/PELTI";
4)  Download the README file in this directory (using "get README") and
review this file in order to obtain any updates/additional information;
5)  Enter "bi" to switch to binary transfer mode;
6)  Use "get [filename]" to retrieve each of the netCDF files.

Regarding the filename convention, recall that the netCDF files are
named as follows:

186XXYY.cdf,

where XX = tf (test flight), ff (ferry flight), or rf (research flight),
and YY = flight number.  Files are available for the following flights:
tf01, tf02, ff01, ff02, and rf01-rf09.

Please let either Ron Ruth, the RAF data manager (303-497-1084 or
ruth@ucar.edu) or I know if you have any problems retrieving the above
files.

One additional note.  Ron and I are presently working on wrapping up the
on-line (Web) data documentation for PELTI.  Hopefully, these materials
will be ready within the next several days.  Once the on-line
documentation site is up, I will send out another email message to all
of you listing the Web site address.

That's all for now.  Once again, I sincerely apologize for any
inconvenience our need to re-process may have caused any of you.  And I
appreciate your patience while I worked to sort everything out on this
end.  Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions
or if I can be of further assistance.

Krista

Hi Ron,

I've finished putting together the PELTI C-13 instrumentation list.
I've placed a copy of this word document (called "pelti_instlist.doc")
in the "pelti_reports" subdirectory of ~/krista.  I've also changed the
file read/write permissions to avoid any problems there.

The last remaining document I'm working on is the data quality report.
I anticipate finishing that up and getting it to you by end of day
tomorrow (Thurs., 9/21).

Thanks.

Krista

Krista,

I'm not sure what's going on, but I did find some PELTI netCDF files in
the ftp directory:
     ~ftp/pub/tmp/sheba
Strangely, they are all owned by you and dated 8 September 2K.  If these
are preliminary or not needed, I suggest you delete them.  Since any of
these files you want to keep are PELTI and not SHEBA, you may want to
move them to a different directory.

I believe I told you about these files previously.  These are the preliminary
PELTI data files that were generated in the field.  Several of the PIs needed
access to them after the project in order to begin their analyses, and the only
directory I had write permission to and could put the files in was my sheba
directory.

I'll probably go ahead and remove them shortly.

Hi Ron,

I've completed the PELTI data quality report and have placed a copy of
the Word document in the pelti_reports subdirectory of ~/krista.  The
file is called "pelti_dqsumm.doc," and I've changed the read/write
permissions so that you shouldn't have trouble retrieving it.

That should be it from my end in terms of the requisite PELTI
documentation.  Thanks for your patience while I sent the various
materials to you in a trickle over the past few weeks.  Also, I realize
you're busy these days, but if we could aim to get the PELTI
documentation released by around 6 October, that would be great.
Several of the PELTI investigators are working on conference
presentations for the upcoming December AGU meeting, and I want to make
certain that they have access to all of the documentation materials that
they might need as soon as possible should they need this information
for their presentations.

Thanks!

Krista

Krista,

I retrieved the QA file and have converted it to HTML (with a few minor
editorial embellishments, like 8-digit dates in the per-flight section).

As I was perusing it, I found the following and was wondering about the
context of "millibar." I think you would want to use "meters per second."

  "4.  In view of the tropical environment in which the majority of the
   PELTI flights were conducted, the decision was made to use the
   humidity-corrected true airspeed (RAF variable TASHC) in the processing
   of the C-130 wind and 1D PMS probe data.  In dry atmospheric conditions
   (e.g., for the test flights in Colorado), TASHC only differs from the
   reference true airspeed data (TASX, set to the radome true airspeed,
   TASR) by a few hundredths of a millibar.  However, during the flights
   conducted in the vicinity of Florida, St. Croix, and Puerto Rico, TASHC
   differed from TASX in some cases by a few tenths of a millibar.  Because
   of the latter differences, it was deemed important to use TASHC in the
   processing of all of the PELTI flights.  Users are, therefore, advised
   to use TASHC in all calculations requiring true airspeed data, especially
   for studies being conducted on those research flights flown in the tropics."

You mentioned Huebert's report to NSF.  Is that the pdf file you gave me,
or is there a link to this document?  I would like to add a link right there
in the QA report rather than shuttle the user somewhere else to find it.

FYI, DOD removed selective availability from the GPS signals on Mayday 2K.

In section II at the beginning you discussed Tony Clarke's FSSP-300.  Please
look over this area to see whether you like the way I formatted it in regards
to the other introductory remarks.

Ron

Yikes!  You're right, I meant to say meters per second.  Please change in the

Krista,

I am just about finished with the PELTI web site and thought you should look
it over before I release its restricted access.  (It now can be viewed only
within ATD.)  Here's the URL:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/PELTI/

Please let me know of changes and/or whether I should release it to the
world.

Thanks.

Subject: PELTI Documentation
Status: RO

Hi Ron,

I just finished looking over the on-line PELTI documentation, and in
general, everything looks great.  I just have one comment, and it's a
minor one.  In the Research Flight Reports, I notice that the "PI" blank
at the top of each form is blank.  This blank should actually be filled
in with "Huebert" in each form, and it's my fault for not filling in the
original forms completely before passing them on to you.

Would it be too much of a problem to make the above addition to each of
the flight reports?  If so, don't worry about, as the rest of the
documentation makes it quite clear that who the primary PI is/was.

Let me know if you can make the above change.  Also, let me know when
the documentation site is ready for "official" release, and I'll send
out an email message to the PELTI PIs and various ATD staff members
announcing the availability of the documentation.

Thanks for your work on this, Ron.  Everything looks great!

Krista

Krista,

I have added "Huebert" to all the P/I lines on the PELTI Research Flight
Reports.  (It was really quick and easy to do.)  I also removed the "Under
Construction" bar from the PELTI home page and edited the .htaccess file to
allow universal access to the site.

So, I guess, in a word I could say the site is "released."

All,

Preparation of the documentation for the PELTI C-130 data set has been
completed, and the on-line data documentation site has officially been
"released."  These materials are now available at the following Web
site:

http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/PELTI/

At this site, you will find data file format information, a data quality
report, project photos, instrumentation lists, a video tape log, and
other documents.  Links to some of the RAF technical bulletins pages are
also included.  You will also find links to Barry Huebert's mission
scientist reports and to his summary document outlining the performance
of the LTI.  (The latter link is included in the RAF data quality
report.)  I encourage all of the PELTI investigators to visit this site,
review the materials, and to print out copies of the various documents
presented at the site.  In this manner, each user can put together
his/her own package of complete data set documentation materials for
future reference.

The cover letter for the PELTI documentation materials (which appears at
the top of the Web page) gives information regarding how users can
obtain copies of the final PELTI data files.  To reiterate briefly,
please note that the final low rate data files are available via ftp
from the RAF.  Users can also contact Ron Ruth, the RAF data manager,
for additional assistance regarding the PELTI data files and/or if
copies of the files are needed on magnetic media.  Ron can be reached by
email at ruth@ucar.edu or by phone at 303-497-1084.  All future
inquiries regarding obtaining PELTI data products (e.g., high rate data
requests, etc.) should be addressed to Ron.  Questions regarding the
data quality and/or comments and concerns about the data should be
addressed to me.  (Contact information is listed below.)

It has been my pleasure to work with all of you over the course of the
PELTI deployment.  I wish each of you continued success with your
analyses of the PELTI data products and in all of your future research
endeavors.  If I or any of my colleagues here at the RAF can be of
assistance in the future, please do not hesitate to call on us.

Best regards,

Krista

Subject: PELTI Data Access Problem
Status: RO

Ron,

I just received a phone call from Alan Bandy at Drexel Univ., and he is
complaining that the connection speed here at the RAF for retrieving
PELTI data files is too slow.  According to Alan, he has traced down the
problem to our server here at the RAF and that the problem does not
exist anywhere else in NCAR.  (I.e., Alan says that he can retrieve
files quickly from other computers at NCAR but cannot get them quickly
from the RAF.)  As a result, Alan is asking that we move the PELTI high
rate data files (which I'm now working on generating) to a computer not
at the RAF.

I have informed Alan that we have new higher speed network connections
throughout NCAR and that I didn't believe the problem exists on our
end.  However, I have told him I'd look into his concerns.  Janet is
presently doing a couple of tests to try and determine exactly what the
transmission rate is for people attempting to retrieve files from our
system.  (Alan is claiming that he can only retrieve files from us at 1
Mbyte per second.)  I also want to ask you what your thoughts are on
this and if you think it would be to our benefit to move the high rate
files I'm generating to another computer somewhere in ATD our in NCAR.
What do you think?

For my part, while I understand Alan's frustration over the slow
transmission rate, I don't believe that a serious bottleneck exists on
our end.  I have pointed out to Alan that several other PELTI
investigators have downloaded the low rate PELTI files quickly and with
no problems.  Given the maze over which network connections can occur,
it seems probable to me that another network connection somewhere
between Drexel and here at NCAR is causing the slowdown.

I will be in contact with Glenn Mitchell (one of Bandy's graduate
students) to let him know what we determine on our end.  Janet will get
back to me as soon as she knows more about our network speeds here.  If
we do not find a definite problem on our end, I can suggest to Glenn
that the high rate files be put on Exabyte tape and FedEx'ed to him at
Drexel for him to download.

Please get back to me with your thoughts are on this as soon as possible
today.  Thanks!

Krista

Krista,

The link from Jeffco to ML is only Ethernet speed:  10 Mbps (1M B/s),
so it may take awhile for a LARGE HRT file to transfer.

Subject: Jeffco Network Connection Speed
Status: RO

Hi Glenn,

I received a phone call from Alan Bandy a little while ago, and he
expressed his concern over the slow network connection speed from Drexel
here to the RAF.  Ron Ruth, the RAF data manager, just confirmed for me
that the connection from Jeffco to the NCAR Mesa Lab is only at the
Ethernet speed of 10 Mbps (1 MB/s).  This is the same speed that Alan
told me you folks had determined for the connection on our end.

Obviously, there is nothing we can do on our end to speed up this
connection.  As I told you yesterday, an approximate size for the high
rate files I'm generating is around 500 Mbytes.  At the above-listed
transfer rate, it should take a little more than 8 minutes for you to
"get" such a file from our system via ftp.  I realize that this speed is
not optimal, but for the above-listed reasons, it's the best we can do.
Also, please note that some of the data files (for example, the test
flight files and some of the shorter ferry flight files) will be smaller
and hence will transfer more quickly.  I note that I am also using gzip
to compress each of the files after I create it.  However, since the
high rate files are already in binary (netCDF) format, this compression
doesn't reduce the file size by much.

I wanted to mention one other option for getting the high rate data
files to you.  After I've created the files, I can copy them onto an
Exabyte tape using tar and can then FedEx you the data tape.  You can
then download the files on your end directly to your system.  Let me
know if you would prefer to go this route.

Please let me know if you have any questions on the above or if we can
be of further assistance.

Krista

Ron, Janet, and Mike:

Included below is a copy of an email message I just receive from Glenn Mitchell,
one of Al Bandy's grad students at Drexel University.  This response to an
earlier message from me outlines Glenn's and Al's concerns and also outlines
their idea for what they would like to do to address the situation.

Obviously, I can't speak for whether or not we can move the high rate PELTI
files I'm presently generating to a machine at the Mesa Lab.  So, I want to
throw this one open to comment from the rest of you.  What are your thoughts
on this, and how do you all think it best to proceed?

Thanks.

Krista,

The plan is to implement web-based MSS transfer scripts and house a central
RAID out here at FL.  We will have a gigabit (1000BaseT) connection from that
machine to the ML and therefore to the VBNS (aka Abeline) indirectly.  So far,
the new CPU machine we need to handle gigabit ethernet is being installed and
will be completed by November 1.  At this time, we only have a limited amount
of FTP storage space, however.  It is my intention to make the proposal to
Dave this fiscal year for the large RAID purchase.  In the mean time, we
can work to squeeze the most out of our space in the interim.  If this is
something that makes sense to you, any vote of support to Dave is accepted :-)

Thanks,
Mike

Krista,

One more thing I should mention that I also brought up in the RAF RMC meeting:
Currently, the files in the RAF FTP area are not compressed.  My tests showed
that, on avergage, file sizes can be reduced by about 50%.  This immediate fix
would give a 2X decrease in the time it takes to download them.  I think gzip
compression is the best at first, since so many people can deal with zip files.
It has also proven to be a better compression algorithm than the standard Unix
compress.

Mike

Glenn,

Having spent more time looking into the matter of whether or not the
high rate PELTI data files can be moved elsewhere at the Mesa Lab for
you to retrieve, I unfortunately have to inform you that this will not
be possible.  At present, no facilities exist for the RAF to store these
data files outside of the RAF.  Thus, you will need to proceed with
retrieving the files from the RAF via ftp.  I will also tar all of the
files onto an Exabyte tape and will send that tape to you via FedEx.

I have almost completed generating the high rate data files for the
project.  However, at present, we have almost run out of room on our ftp
disk here.  So, I would like to ask you to go ahead and start retrieving
the high rate files I've placed in the ftp partition.  Once you have
this first group of files, I'll remove them from the ftp space and will
move in the last group of high rate files.

At present, I've placed high rate files for TF01 and TF02, FF01, and
RF01-RF06 in the ftp directory.  The filename convention is as follows:

186XXYYh.cdf.gz,

where XX is TF, FF, or RF, and YY is the flight number.  "gz" denotes
that the file has been compressed with gzip, and you'll need to
uncompress each file with gunzip on your end.  The "h" after "YY"
denotes that the file contains high rate data.

To retrieve the files, do the following:

1)  ftp raf.atd.uar.edu;
2)  Log on as anonymous and enter your full email address as the
password;
3)  Change to the correct correct using "cd pub/tmp/sheba";
4)  Enter "bi";
5)  Use "get [filename]" to retrieve each file.

Once you've retrieved copies of the nine files presently in the above
ftp directory, please notify me by email and I'll go ahead and remove
the files and put the last four high rate files in the same directory.

One note regarding the data.  We (the RAF) do not routinely distribute
the two variables IRBC and IRTC at a high rate 25 samples/second (sps).
Given the slower response of the two IR radiometers on our aircraft, the
data from the instruments are considered most reliable at 1
sample/second.  I have included 25 sps IRBC and IRTC in each of the high
rate data files at your request.  However, I stress that you should use
these data with caution and should still consider the low rate (1 sps)
IRBC and IRTC data to be of the best quality.

That's all for now.  Please let me know if you have any trouble
retrieving the above files and/or if you have any additional questions.

Regards,

Krista

Krista,

Thanks for keeping me up to date on this.  I'm sorry I didn't let you
know that you could have put these files in the PELTI path I created for
the low-rate data.  That would have made things a bit clearer for those
retrieving the data.  I guess it's too late now.

Do you want me to archive these HRT files to the Mass Store?  I noticed
that they only exist on the ftp site and that other HRT files are present
in /productiondata (not a big deal).

RDP is planning a totally new way for users to retrieve data from our catalog,
and it will include buffered disk space at FL-1 that will have a high-speed
connection to the internet.  Mike was looking at having it up and running 
in about a month or so.  This should help distribution for future projects.
Too bad it isn't already in place, but much of the hardware was purchased
with year-end money.

Ron,

Yes, I would like you to archive the high rate files to the MSS.
I can't presently place all of the files in /jnet/ftp/pub/tmp/sheba because
there isn't adequate room, so that's why they're split up between the two
directories.

So, can you go ahead and archive all of the "h" files in
 /jnet/ftp/pub/tmp/sheba?
Also, please go ahead and archive the high rate files in /jnet/productiondata.

Thanks, in advance, for your help!

Krista
