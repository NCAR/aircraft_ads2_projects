Allen,

I went through the ACE-1 VarDB file, corrected a bunch of minor things (like
changing CAL 1 to CAL1) and added new standard variables (like DBZF, PLWCC1)
that are in the master VarDB file.

I then looked at the header of file `130t02.cdf' on the `/home/data' disk
to find variables having no definitions.  If you can provide descriptions
and units for the variables listed below, I'd be happy to add them to the
VarDB list for ACE-1.  If you think any of these should be added to the
master VarDB list, please indicate that, too.  At the same time I can
also add fixed/floating and range values if you give me that information.
                                                                         Master
Name        Units     Description                                         too?

There are lots of variables that have rather generic names:
CAL1
CAL2
EXT
IMP1
IMP2
IMPTOT
INFLOW
INTEMP
H2O2
MANFOLD
TRAP1
TRAP2
TRAP3
XEXT
I hate to see these, because it then becomes hard to define similar
measurements later.  (On the other hand, I suppose it makes it easier
for the users.)  I don't suppose there's much we can do about them now--
just future food for thought.

Allen, Bob and Dick,

Following is a transcription of the tape portion of the hand-written 
Data Tape Log for ACE-1.  Please be aware that it is incomplete and
has some entries which are missing or may be approximate.  It is known
that some date entries are wrong, so please use this summary with caution.
I will correct it when I get new information.

Allen, Bob and Dick,

Here is the latest copy of the RAF file name:
  /home/local/proj/130/Production/archive/tapes.130
which corrects some of the flight dates.  Some of the times are still
approximate (or missing) until we run the tapes through NIMBUS to verify them.

Allen,

I just got a call from Bob Rilling questioning us about the correct date
for RF01.  We have 10/31/95.  The SABL tape case shows 10/31/95, but when
played back, it starts on 10/30/95.  Since the SABL "gets its information
directly from the GPS," (according to Bob), he thinks the date should be
10/30/95.

What's your opinion?

Dick,

I just talked with Bob Rilling, Dick Friesen and Allen Schanot regarding the
ACE-1 data you would like to have.  (Bob said you were most interested in GPS
position information from RF01-RF12.)

Allen told me a few minutes ago that he was almost ready to do production
(final) processing on RF01-RF17.  I just shipped the ExaByte tapes for
RF18-RF33 to ML for archiving to the Mass Store.

Dick Friesen told me that you already have a login here to our machines.
Do you remember the password?  If not, contact Bob Campbell (bob@raf.atd).

The data for any of the ACE-1 flights (assuming someone processed it) can be
found on our system in either of two directories:
   /home/data              <-- scratch directory for test and preliminary data
   /home/productiondata    <-- Production directory for final data sets

They will have names of the form 130rfX.cdf, where the X stands for a flight
number and possible segment letter (e.g., 130rf03b.cdf).  Any files in the
/home/data directory may have a partial time period or may have non-standard
output rates.

You may use rcp or ftp to copy them wherever you want.  Please realize that
these data are not to be generally distributed yet, so please satisfy only
your own needs.

If you have any special flights you'd like to see, please let Al Schanot
know which ones.  If you want special consideration (i.e., you want us
to process flights especially for you), please make such a request through
Dick Friesen.

I'll be at FL-1 next Tuesday if you want to discuss any of this.

Here is a summary of all information I have on the ACE-1 master ADS raw data
tapes.  I made made copies of them having corrections for flight number and
start date.  They are the tapes that I will be archiving to the Mass Store
and which Al Schanot will be using for his production runs.

Ron,

Thanks for the email. I was able to grab rf04a and rf04b and merge
them with SABL data to make some nice msl relative plots. I had to
subract one year from the date to get it to sync with the SABL data
but the surface is appears close to zero msl so I think it's the right
stuff. This as I understand it is a Hawaii smoke plume flight. The
other one is the next day rf05 which I haven't found in cdf
anywhere. These two flights seem to be of interest to an outside
investigater otherwise I am unable to prioritize. I will do the other
flights I can see data for (1,2,3,&9).

Al Schanot suggested I contact you regarding some ACE-1 variable names for
which I need descriptions and units.  (I also need to know whether these
variables should be put into the RAF master variable list.)  Can you please
help me?

Krista & Allen,

So far, no good!  Because you, Krista, are now in production on SCMS, I
thought it important to first stage the remaining SCMS raw ADS tape (RF07,
R1001) to the SCD Mass Store System (MSS) and use it as a test case for the
large block of tapes that ACE has.  My first try failed with very little
explanation contained in the MSS log file that the job returned.

I emailed the MIGS "import" job request command and the MSS log file to
Kathy Fryberger, the SCD "import" expert, and am awaiting a reply before
proceeding again.  I was hopeful that things would go more smoothly now,
but, apparently that will not be the case.

I hope Kathy can give me some ideas and/or pointers to ease the situation.
It may be that the switch to the new MSCP (Mass Store Control Processor)--
tentatively scheduled for 5 February--will have to occur before tape staging
will work reliably.  (I wonder if even that will really change anything.)
Oh, well, gotta remain optimistic!

Allen,

I just perused the VarDB file for ACE-1, and I propose the following changes
to be consistent with our other variables:

CN3010C   N/cc   CLARKE Particle Concentrations
Change units to N/cm3 instead of N/cc.

CN3025     N     CLARKE Particle Counts
CN3760     N     CLARKE Particle Counts
XO3FCNT    N     Fast Ozone Counts
Change units to cnts instead of N.

Allen,

I have successfully archived to the MSS 3 ADS tapes for ACE-1 whose data fit
in only one bitfile:  RF22A, RF27A and RF27B.  Though they took a little over
24 hours, all completed on the first job try.

Next Tuesday 6 February, SCD is cutting over to the new Mass Store Control
Processor.  Beginning tomorrow, they will not accept any new tape-staging
jobs until the switch-over is complete.  (The want to have all of the existing
jobs finished before they pull the plug.)  They don't expect any problems and,
in fact, are hopeful that the new machine will improve our throughput.
We'll see.

If all goes well, I estimate about 3 (or more) archive jobs should complete
each day.  Since I have a total of 43 jobs in this first wave, I am optimistic
that it will take about two weeks to complete this half of the archiving.
(There are 33 archive jobs in the second wave.)

I set up the multiple-bitfile jobs to save 16,000 records to each bitfile.
I am reasonably sure that the record sizes allow that many to fit in
400,000,000 bytes.  I had no trouble stashing 15,000 for other projects,
and by checking those bitfiles sizes, it looked like I could have used
16,000 for them, too.

Krista,

When I first tried to archive 6-130 ACE-1 RF28, I exceeded the 400MB limit
with less than 13000 records; normally I can read at least 15000.  Using
`xtv' I looked at the record sizes for that tape and found the SDI records
were 31752 bytes instead of the more usual 16776 (RF30).  Allen told me
that, sometime during the project, you upped rates on a bunch of variables,
causing these larger SDI records.

Can you please give me information on which flights have these higher-rates?
I know that RF30 had smaller records, because I checked its record structure,
too.  It will help me immensely when I archive the data for them.

Thanks.

Steve,

Allen Schanot asked me to send you the summary I made of all the raw ADS tapes
for the ACE-1 project (1996-130).  Please be aware that data from the first
17 flights have yet to be archived to the SCD Mass Store System (MSS).  (Those
tapes which have been archived are in COS-blocked format to preserve record
and file boundaries.)

The second section of this message has the current directory list of all the
MSS bitfiles for this project.  Within the next week or two, I will begin
archiving the remaining raw ADS data.  When Allen is finished with the final
production processing with NIMBUS, and he gives me the OK sign, I'll archive
the netCDF files.

Allen,

I was acting as "webmaster" today and checking out some of our Web sites.
I hit upon OFPS's ACE-1 home page.  Within it was a page about the C-130's
flight reports, so I checked it out.  They listed only the first 28 flights
(RF01-RF28), and of those, three of them had dates that disagreed with ours.

Steve,

As I promised you over the phone, here are the MSS Bitfile Log (having all
the flights with their dates and processed data times) and the Variable List
from one netCDF file's header.  (All the data sets have the same variable
list.)  Since these Production data files have not yet been archived to the
MSS, the log is only informational.

When I put the netCDF files on your system via ftp, do you have any name
conventions you would like me to use?  Our normal convention here at Jeffco
for these files is:  130rfXXS.cdf, where the "XX" has a two-digit flight
number, and the "S" is an optional segment letter (in lower case).  You
can use "fltno" column in the table below as a guide to all our names.
(Note:  the entry for RF04A has two time segments.)

Following the log is the Variable List.  It may not look formatted, but I
have used <TAB> characters as delimiters between name, units and description.
Since that is the only use of the <TAB> character, you may find it useful
when translating it to a data base.

I perused your ACE web site last week and found one discrepancy in the URL:
http://www.ofps.ucar.edu/data/ace_1/html/aircraft.html.  It is the date for
RF10.  Al Schanot contends that ours is correct.

I'll be in touch.  Have a nice weekend.  Let us know if there is anything else
you want or if you need any of this information explained in more detail.

Ron,
Thanks for the list. I noticed that the flight inventories have
been changed to reflect corrected dates. I went through the
mission summary notes and have a few differences on dates. I'll
try to resolve these between ops reports from Hobart and notes.
By the way, how did you resolve the crossing of the dateline?
I assume you added a day traveling West and subtracted a day
heading east. Was this done at the exact time of dateline crossing
by the GPS location?

We should be ready for data on Monday. I'll be in the office around 
10:30A, following a presentation to a grade school.

Have a great weekend,

Steve Williams

Steve,

Our data sets use dates and times that are UTC, not local.  As a result,
we don't need to deal with the International Date Line.

You have a great weekend, too.

Ron,
I have created an account on one of our disks for you to transfer
the ACE-1 1 Hz data files. There should be plenty of room. You can
transfer in stages if you prefer. The FTP info:

torrent-fddi.ofps.ucar.edu
login: raf
password: spfo2far

This will place you in the right directory for transfer. No need to cd.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Steve,

Thanks for the info.  I will begin the transfers later this afternoon.  I plan
to use file names with the same as I use for the SCD Mass Store System without
the directory prefix, i.e., RFxx.cdf, where the xx stands for the flight
number (with optional segment), e.g. RF027B.cdf.

If you have some other naming scheme you would like me to use, now's
the time to let me know.

Steve,

I just completed transferring the C-130 1-sps production NIMBUS flight data
for the ACE-1 project comprising 39 netCDF files.  I have verified that the
sizes agree with their respective parent files.  Following is the directory
list I got from your machine via ftp.  Please give the files a workout to
make sure that all is well.

Ron,
Everything looks fine from this end. However, as we get into the load
on CODIAC which involves reading the files and producing data plots
and subsets of data, that will be the true test of the data. If we
see anything I'll let you know, but am expecting no problems.

Many thanks for your efforts.... I've already had 4 requests for the
C-130 data!

Ron,
Wow! We should get together more often! You must have been inspired!
Also thanks for the timely processing of the ACE-1 data. The PIs
have been "beating down the door" for these data. Many need the
C-130 position/state parameter data to process their own, and I
was somewhat reluctant to pass on the preliminary data.

Appreciate the help, and will contact you if we have any questions.

Hi Ron,

I remembered this morning that Dick F. had thought it was a
good idea to keep you informed of any data we project managers
had prepared and released to outside users.  A couple of
months ago, Don Lenschow and a colleague named Qing Wang
requested some high-rate data for ACE-1 flights RF11 and RF12.
I prepared these data for them but forgot to notify you.  My
apologies, but, I had to re-process these data anyway over the
past couple of days to get them some different time segments
and variables.  So, following is a summary of what I prepared
and released to Don and Qing:

RF11
----

Variables:  ATRL,PSFDC,RHOLA,THETA,O3FC,TASF,TASR,XUIC,XVIC,XWIC
Time segments:  02:22:01-02:52:00
                02:55:01-03:25:00
                03:27:51-03:58:00
                04:02:01-04:31:00
                04:33:01-04:49:00
All variables output at 25 Hz


RF12
----

Same variables as above for RF11
Time segments:  00:30:00-05:15:00
All variables output at 25 Hz               


The netCDF files resulting from this processing were placed in
my directory in /home/ftp/pub and will be retrieved by Don and Qing
using anonymous ftp.

Sorry for forgetting to send you the original information a few weeks
ago, but this should cover things now.

Krista

Allen,

I wrote a little program that will change the character-based attribute of any
variable in a netCDF file.  It can, therefore, be used to fix the "units" and
"long_name" for ATFH in the ACE-1 files.

At present, the program asks you for the variable name, the attribute and its
new value.  I strongly urge you to run this program from "mistral" to save
execution time.  Also, to change both "units" and "long_name," you need to run
the program twice.    For now I kept it simple and general, so it can change
any single text attribute.

If I work on it, I can probably modify it to change other attribute types
(like floating-point or integer) and to change more than one attribute at a
time.

Here is an example of how to use it with the production ACE-1
netCDF file:  130rf18.cdf

Legend:  You type anything that is underlined.
         Program:  <-- text output by the program -->


            cd  /home/local/proj/130/Production/ncfixattr
            ---------------------------------------------

            ncfixattr /home/productiondata/130rf18.cdf
            ------------------------------------------

Program:    Change a character-based variable attribute in a netCDF file

Program:    Enter Variable's Name (e.g., ATWH): ATWH
                                                ----
Program:    Enter Attribute's Name (e.g., units or long_name): units
                                                               -----
Program:    Enter new Attribute's value
               (e.g., C or Ambient Temperature, Deiced Wing): C
                                                              -
    Time will pass while the entire netCDF file is copied to a new
     file with the changed attribute.  (Sorry but that's the way
     some of these netCDF functions work.)

Program:     Changed variable ATWH attribute units to C

I forgot to tell you that, since the netCDF files are owned by the `nimbus'

Dick and Allen,

I have completed the task of stripping and archiving to the SCD Mass Store
System files containing the PMS-2D records from all the raw ADS data tapes
for ACE-1.  I used the program `/home/local/bin/dnl2d' to do this work.
This program has a file date of 11 March 1996 11:05, and has, so far as I
know, the code to alert the user of off-sized records.  None were reported
by `dnl2d' for any of the files created for this project.

The log for this work can be found in the file:
     /home/local/proj/130/Production/archive/strip2d.log

Allen,

The PMS-2D data records for the 1996-130 ACE-1 project have been stripped from
the raw ADS tapes and put into UNIX files, one for each flight segment, having
a logical record length of 28812 bytes.  For those data segments whose total
length exceeded 400,000,000 bytes, the data were split into multiple files.
The data were then archived to the SCD Mass Store System via MIGS using
transparent transfer and protected with both READ and WRITE passwords.  (The
WRITE password protects a bitfile from being overwritten.  The READ password
prevents unauthorized read access.  Steve will need the READ password to add
the data to his archive, and I am willing to give it to him via phone but not
over the net.)

Thanks for the info.  I keep a mail file for each project, so I will put
this information there (/home/local/proj/archives/mail/130).

Qing and Don,

Okay, I've finished re-processing the ACE-1 data for RF11 and
RF12.  I've generated one high-rate file for each flight, and
the specs for each are as follows:


RF11
----

Time segment:  02:22:01 - 04:50:00 GMT
Same variables as originally requested
File size:  ~9 Mb
Ozone concentrations:  ~25 ppbv


RF12
----

Time segment:  00:30:01 - 05:15:00 GMT
Same variables as originally requested
File size:  ~17 Mb
Ozone concentrations:  ~25-50 ppbv

(Ozone concentrations definitely look more reasonable now!)

Both of these files are in the anonymous ftp directory
/home/ftp/pub/krista on our server mistral.  As before, just
log on as anonymous in ftp to retrieve these files.

As Dick Schillawski pointed out in his email message to you,
Qing, the ozone data should be viewed as preliminary, as he and
Greg Kok are still refining the processing coefficients before
the final processing runs are done here at RAF.

Let me know if either of you have any questions pertaining to
these data.

Steve,

I wasn't aware that you were immediately interested in the raw, stripped
PMS-2D data once we transferred them from the ADS tapes and archived them to
the SCD Mass Store System (MSS), so I apologize for the 3-week delay in giving
you this information.  (I completed this task in mid March.  Allen Schanot
told me of your need this morning.) 

Do you want to pick up the bitfiles from the MSS, or would you rather I ftp
all these data to you like I did last time?  At present these data are only
on the MSS, so I'm not sure how I would transfer them directly from the MSS
to your machine; I would probably bring them back down here to Jeffco first,
then ftp them over--a somewhat convoluted path.

Please let me know what you want to do.

In case you want to transfer the data yourself, below is the log information.
If you plan to use using MIGS, transfer the files transparently.  If you plan
to use ftp, just remember to set the file type to "image" before doing the
transfer.  (You need a special login to "massive.ucar.edu," the machine name
for the MSS.  If you don't have one, it is probably easier for you to use MIGS
or let me do the transfers.)

In case you need them, here are examples of the two types of commands.
Each will put the data from RF01 into the local file RF01.2d in your
current directory.  (Be sure directory write permissions are set correctly.)

MIGS:  nrnet msget RF01.2d l df=tr r flnm=/RAF/1996/130/PMS2D/RF01

ftp (once logged in to "massive"):  bi
                                    get /RAF/1996/130/PMS2D/RF01 RF01.2d

Ron,

I am trying to get ready for Monterey.  I guess I'll be responsible for 
supplying a "first look" at the data.  I was wondering if this segment you
sent is comparable to what I will receive from you guys at the end of a 
flight?  I have been fooling around with mexcdf and have found one problem
which I would like to resolve.  When I pull of high-rate variables using
getcdf, they are in the form of a 2-d matrix.  i.e. if time =2100 values,
then I get time X 25 wind values stored across in columns.  I would prefer
vectors 52500 in length 1:25 equivalent to 1st second, 26-50 equivalent to 
the 2nd second, etc.  Can it be pulled off in this manner?

Steve,

Allen Schanot has some ACE-1 documentation files in WordPerfect that he
wants me to get to you.  What is the best way?  I can put them in a public
area of our ftp server for you to pick up; would that work?

The files are:
130_cal.wpd   130_qa.wpd    paramete.wpd
130_cov.wpd   ari.wpd       video_lo.wpd

Ron,
Yes, we are looking for these Wordperfect files. We will convert
them to HTML and put them in CODIAC to document the C-130 data
which is on-line. I have had several requests for this documentation
since the data has been FTPed by several investigators.

Why don't you put it out in one of your anonymous FTP locations
and we'll grab it. 

I'll get back to you shortly on the PMS-2D data. We have been up to
our (you know what) with getting a lot of these ACE-1 data on-line.

Thanks again for your help and quick response.

Steve Williams

Steve,

You can now retrieve the WordPerfect files via anonymous ftp from our machine
"chinook.atd.ucar.edu" in the directory "pub/ACE-1" with the following names:
     130_cal.wpd   130_qa.wpd    paramete.wpd
     130_cov.wpd   ari.wpd       video_lo.wpd
Please let me know when you have them so I can recover the space.

Ron,
We have downloaded the Word Perfect files for ACE-1. To verify,
we have a total of 5 not including the cover letter. What we
have done under our ACE-1 page is convert the documents to HTML
and provide a link to the individual documents through the RAF
cover letter. For example, you list 11 documents in the cover
letter of which the 5 you sent are linked. What about the
remaining 6 documents? Any chance we could get digital versions
of the following documents:

Output Tape log
Research Flight Reports
Summary of IRS performance
Bulletin No. 9
Bulletin No. 23
Output Tape Format Description

In any event remove the documents from your anonymous FTP area
and let me know about the remaining six. If you want to see
how we linked the documents you sent, check under:

http://www.ofps.ucar.edu/data/ace_1/html/project.html

Click under "ACE-1 C-130 Project Documentation Summary"

Let me know what you think.

Steve,

I have a text version of the "Output Tape Log" (in reality our Mass Store
Bitfile Log).  You may also be interested in a "Raw ADS Tape Summary" and
a "MASS STORE BITFILE LOG FOR STRIPPED PMS-2D DATA" which also exist.  I'll
include them at the end of this reply.  At this moment, they don't exist in
WordPerfect format.

I have added two more WordPerfect files to our anonymous ftp site:
`ace_iru.sum' and `ace.rfr' which are the "Summary of IRS Performance" and
"Research Flight Reports," respectively.  I didn't include them originally,
because they didn't have a "wpd" extension, so I thought they were plain
text files.  Both are in the same ftp location:  chinook.atd:pub/ACE-1, so
you can pick them up at your leisure.

At this time Bulletin No. 9 is undergoing a complete rewrite and does not
exist in final form.  Of greatest interest to a user is an Appendix to that
document which shows how most of our derived variables are calculated along
with a list of references.  I can make that available to you soon (after I
replace a corrupted file).  It will be in WordPerfect format.

Bulletin No. 23, at present, is terribly out-of-date, too, and exists only
as a paper document, but there is a rumor that a TeX version is available.
In case of a choice, which version would you want?

Allen informed me that the "Output Tape Format Description" is a misnomer.
The LRT data (in netCDF) will only be available on-line via your site.  The
HRT data (also in netCDF) will be available via the SCD Mass Store System (and
on tape only via a request to ATD).  I have a short writeup concerning the
use of netCDF as our output tape format and have put a copy in the file:
chinook.atd:pub/ACE-1/netCDF.txt2.  You may find it useful.

The documents you already retrieved have been removed.  Only new ones remain.

Steve,

I looked at your site, and I think, in general, it is excellent.  It is too
bad that Allen retrieved an ancient template for a cover letter.  He is of
the opinion that it should be removed until we can fix it up, but, of course,
it is your "anchor page" for the rest of the site--too bad.  The document has
an obsolete reference to SCD's previous Mass Store (the old Ampex TeraBit
Memory system).  I also have an aversion to the use of Hz to imply samples-
per-second.  A mention of Hz, to me, implies the data set's Nyquist frequency,
which is half the sample rate.  Explicit use of "samples per second" avoids
any confusion.

Omitted from the list of documents are two other log files:  one describing
the raw ADS tapes and another describing the raw, stripped PMS-2D data.  Both
of these items need to be added to the list.

I brought down your web document:
(http://www.ofps.ucar.edu/data/ace_1/html/130_cov.html) and edited it to make
some of these corrections.  I put a revised copy of this HTML file on our ftp
site for you to grab, too (same name: 130_cov.html); it is better than the one
you are presently using.  Allen may want to make more changes.  I'm sure that
he will want to regenerate a revised WordPerfect version of it, too.  So,
there will probably be another version of this cover letter coming (the
"official" version, I hope).

The HTML document "http://www.ofps.ucar.edu/data/ace_1/html/130_qa.html,"
for some reason, has all the PMS probe names in bold print--the only times
bold is used.  To me this is unnecessary.

The HTML document "http://www.ofps.ucar.edu/data/ace_1/html/video_lo.html"
lost a bit of formatting at the beginning.  There is a 3-line heading above
the video log entries whose understanding requires the text to be aligned
above the respective columns.  Because of the HTML translation, they all
became left justified.  This document may be better displayed with a straight,
unformatted text transfer and viewed by a non-proportional font.  (Also, space
was left for "remarks," but there were none.

 [Note for Steve, not for general distribution:  Allen is now in the process
  of generating the production low-rate (LRT) data sets.  (You are aware that
  you now have preliminary LRT data, even though the netCDF headers do not say
  so.  I would strongly caution anyone who wants to access these data not to
  use these files for critical research until they are replaced with the final
  production data sets.)  The log file that follows only applies to the low-
  rate (LRT) data.  A separate log will be generated for the high-rate (HRT)
  data, since the time intervals will be different.  (Note the "Data type"
  entry.)]

 [Note for Steve, not for general distribution:  Please be aware,
 in the log that follows, that the PMS-2D data are only saved as raw ADS
 records in a UNIX file format (a long string of bits); they have no processed
 images.  Interested users need to be aware of this.  (Allen will add such
 a description to the cover letter.)  The question marks in the times result
 from not knowing where the time segments are split.  Since some of the
 flights produced more than 400,000,000 bytes of data (the single bitfile
 capacity of the MSS), they had to be split into segments.  Time is not
 decoded during the copy process, so the times at segment boundaries are
 unknown.]

Steve,

This afternoon I revisited your ACE-1 home page and found that the "ACE-1
C-130 Project Documentation Summary" has yet to change.  I am a bit
disappointed about this because of the misinformation I pointed out to you
in my previous email (23 April 1996).

Any chance someone will fix it soon?

Ron,
I just returned to town after being on travel since last Thursday.
I thought this was supposed to be done; I'll check on it.

Thanks for the "heads up"

Hello Ron,
 
      Thank you for your swift reply. Tar files on high density
8mm ExaByte tapes will work for us. We would also appreciate the 
additional documentation. The address you have for me is correct.
We have information on netCDF, although we are still working out
some details with the format. 

     I look forward to receiving the tapes. Thank you for your help.

Regards,
Alan

Dick and Allen,

I have moved the original NIMBUS netCDF files for 6-130 ACE-1 RF01-RF17
to the directory "/home/productiondata/original."

Probably by the time you get this email, I will have moved all the 130rf*.cdf
production files from the "/home/data" directory to the "/home/productiondata"
directory.  Therefore "/home/productiondata" will have a mix of production
and original data.  (RF01-RF17 are production, RF18-RF35 are original.)

I plan to archive the production data files to the SCD Mass Store System
in the next day or three.

Dick, you can work on the other flights just as you did with the first 17.
If or when you need more room in "/home/data," please let me know, and I'll
move a bunch more in the same manner.

Hope this isn't too confusing.

Was it just an oversight, or did you really want to output the constant
variables, named ONE and ZERO, in the producion ACE-1 data set?

Ron,
The following e-mail came in from Australia regarding the C-130
data. We have corrected the time conversion problem (our end),
but it appears the FSSP problem is in the NetCDF data. Could you
look into this and see what it might be?

Thanks,
Steve Williams

Hi Steve,
I received the 8mm tape in the mail today, thank you for being so prompt.
I have just read off one of the flights and had a quick look at the data.
I have found that there is a problem with some of the files. The problem 
is in the _multi files or specifically I have noticed it in the FSSP-100 
spectra and at a quick glance the 260-X aswell. But first, it appears as 
if the time in all the files is wrong. For flight 12, the prelim data 
that I already had and the README file that came with the data you just 
sent, say that the flight started at 22:25:09 UTC, but in all the data 
files for this flight that I read off the tape you just sent say 15:25:09 
UTC. I have just looked at two more sets of flights and this is the same 
for them aswell, ie 7 hours different!

Now for the _multi files. I have found that the droplet spectra from the 
FSSP-100 are wrong in every fourth channel. Here is a comparison of the 
prelim data that I had and the data that came off the tape, units are N/cm-3

Channels 4, 8 and 12 appear to have incorrect data in them. This is the 
case all the way through the R12.CFSSP_OBR_multi file. A quick look at 
another flight and it appears that something strange is happening there 
aswell (as it happens its only channels 4 and 12 for that flight). Looking at 
the 260-X file (R12.C260X_IBR_multi) it also looks like something strange 
could be happening. I checked the single data file (R12_single) and it 
appears to have the correct FSSP-100 droplet concentration and liquid water 
content (202.391357 N/cm-3 and 0.345770 g/m-3 resp.) but the average 
radius appears to be wrong (14.268713 um, may calcs using the old spectra
give ~7.13 um). 

I have ample to work with at the moment, but I will require the FSSP-100 
and 260-X spectra in about a month. Thanks again for being so propmt with 
the data.  Cheers Paul Krummel

Ron,
The following e-mail came in regarding some of the "spikes" in the
location data. We saw these in the field and for the preliminary
data we edited them out for plotting purposes. What is the
RAF policy on these things? Would this be something that the
PI would be responsible for editing?

Thanks,

Here is the data section where I found wrong latitude values.  All the other
variables appear correct.  The wrong latitude values occur at 19:19:08,
19:19:14, and 19:19:16.  This data section is from 12 Nov., 1995 (flight 13)
of ACE-1.  The original asc data file was retrieved from CODIAC.

Hope this helps.

Steve:  With regard to the inquiry about PMS 1-D data from ACE-1:

	We have reviewed the original Netcdf files that we transfered
	to you.  There is NO problem with the FSSP concentrations.  We
	get exactly the same results as were distributed in the field.
	Like the time problem, this appears to be the result of something
	UCAR is doing during your conversion of the data to the ASCII
	format.  We looked at the individual bin concentrations, as well
	as total concentration (CONCF), liquid water content (PLWCF) and
	mean diameter (DBARF).  We must dispute the Users claim in one 
	area however.  The mean FSSP droplet diameter is, in fact, 14 um
	during the interval in question.  They may not be using the 
	proper bin sizes in their calculations - see the "CAL" file
	we transmitted for the proper values.

	As we discussed during our meeting, a new 1 sec data set has 
	been prepared with the Kok ozone & carbon monoxide data added
	in.  Since we were preparing this data set anyway, we took the 
	opportunity to fix a few small problems in the original release -
	namely the spikes in the IRS position data.  If the User had read
	our recommendations, he/she would be using the GPS position data
	anyway.  In any case, the new data set is ready for you to take.
	This set should replace the original in all places.  Contact 
	Ron Ruth for info on the transfer.

	With regard to the project documentation files, the QA summary
	has been expanded to cover the RAF chemistry data.  A special
	review of the PMS data provided by Darrel Baumgardner has also
	been added.  Please replace that file in your archive as well.

Steve,

At the end of this message is the Mass Store System (MSS) bitfile log having
the location of all the low-rate (LRT) production data sets for ACE-1.  They
have been saved "transparently," not COS-blocked (as were our old GENPRO
bitfiles), so they should be easy to retrieve.  In case you have a problem
interpreting the format of that log, the MSS bitfile name for RF01 is:
/RAF/1996/130/LRT/RF01 (replace "fltno" with one of the flight numbers).

In case I didn't mention it before, a new data quality report from Allen
Schanot replaces the one originally given to you.  You can pick it up
(as well as some other related ACE-1 files you may already have) via
anonymous ftp from "chinook.atd.ucar.edu" in the "pub/ACE-1" directory.
After you have retrieved all of these that you want, please let me know
so I can delete them from this temporary location.

Please let me know if you have any questions or problems.

Chris gave me this message regarding the new NIMBUS release to pass along to
you (before he left for the weekend):
   Be sure to thoroughly check out PALT, since its calculation has
    been changed to add the B-57's high-altitude code.
He thinks it is the only change which may cause you trouble.

Allen,

Yes.  It's called "ncextr," and Chris wrote it early this year.  It runs like
the other windowed netCDF utilities, and it also supports batch files.  If you
just want to limit the time period, you can run a batch version to copy ALL
the variables using the following lines as an example batch file:
     if=/home/productiondata/130RF14H.cdf
     of=/home/productiondata/130RF14h.cdf
     ti=09:00:00-10:00:00

ncextr -b batchfile

You obviously would run it from the "nimbus" login.

There is a man page for it.

Upon looking at the Flight_11 file (and the netCDF output header for RF14)
I noticed that you are putting out some variables at high rate that normally
are output at low rate (DPB, DPT, PLWC, PLWC1, RSTB, RSTB1, COCAL, COCOR,
COZRO, DPBC, DPTC, DPXC, EDPC, MR, PALT, PALTF, PSFC, PSFDC, PSURF, PSX,
PSXC, RHODT, RHUM, XVEWC, XVNSC.  Are you sure of all these?

The following variables will be garbage if output at high rate:  XLATC and
XLONC.  (XVEWC and XVNSC may have this same problem.)

Also there is one variables without VarDB description:  FUDGE

Do you really want to output PSFD1, PSFD2, ONE and ZERO?

Let's talk.

Allen,

I took the liberty to rename your high-rate files to conform to the format my
scripts use.  It is minor; I just changed the capital H to lower case.  I just
didn't want you to be confused if you could not find a particular file.

By the way, are you keeping a production log of all these processing runs?
I didn't find one in the Production directory.

Allen,

I just spoke with Steve Williams regarding status of ACE-1.  He didn't know
whether Namal had retrieved all the LRT data bitfiles from the SCE Mass Store
System (MSS), but he would check with him and let me know the current status
(as well as when all files have been retrieved).

I also gave him an update on the HRT data.

They used the standard netCDF "ncdump" routine to get the ASCII data, so he
was concerned that we didn't see the PMS problem that they got.  He did say
that, of the production LRT data they did retrive, the problem no longer
existed, and he suggested that only the earlier preproduction set may have
had the problem.  I thought you looked at both of these data sets and saw no
problems.  If that is the case, then there is concern about how those bogus
values got dumped.  I told Steve that we would look into it, now that I looked
at the "/home/productiondata" directory, I see that I purged the preliminary
files, so the evidence has been destroyed.  (OFPS may still have copies of
the original files in case we want to check things.)

Steve also mentioned that the production data for RF30 were missing from the
MSS.  I also noticed that I don't have a log listing for that flight, either.
Did it get skipped by mistake?

Allen,

I'll see that it gets archived to the MSS and then update the MSS Bitfile Log.

Did you tell me that I should archive the HRT files that are clogging the
/home/productiondata directory, or does Dick have to do "his thing" with
them first?

Ron:  The production data disc is full ( I know it says 96% - but it
	killed one of my jobs because of a lack of space).  Can you move
	some of these files?

thanks

Allen,

I archived to the SCD Mass Store System the HRT production data sets listed
below and have verified that all were successfully transferred from RAF.
So, it's OK for you to zap the originals from the "/productiondata" directory.

Allen,

I'm not sure what the reference is for the above.  Is someone wanting
priveleged access to data?  Is it something for me to worry about?

I'll take this opportunity to let you know that I have archived the last
LRT flight (RF30) to the MSS (Schillawski's version in /home/data), and
I verified its MSS directory listing.

Ron,
Any word yet on the missing Flight 30 for ACE-1? We have a number of
requests backing up here for an ASCII tape and I don't want to
make the tape without Flight 30 because we would have to go back
and redo it. The PIs need the latest C-130 data to process their own
data prior to the workshop.

Let me know when you think flight 30 will be ready.

Thanks,
Steve Williams

Ron,
It appears nothing is wrong with the plotting. However, the system was
saturated with users when we tried which gave us the error. The
problem is that it gave us the wrong error message and we'll fix that.
Go ahead and try it again when you get a chance.

Steve,

The production high-rate data for ACE-1 are now available.  Following this
message is the SCD Mass Store System (MSS) bitfile log for these data.

I have not yet retried the on-line data display from CODIAC, but yesterday,
when it wasn't working, I requested a data segment from one of the flights.
The data and two description email messages arrived here at Jeffco today.

I looked at the netCDF file header and discovered that all the global
attributes from our original netCDF file are MISSING!!  I contend that
these are very important pieces of information that should not be dropped.
I admit that when a time segment from a flight is requested (as I had done),
one can get an erroneous time period, since you would have to adjust the
TimeInterval (and perhaps the FlightDate as well) to make them agree with the
data segment.  Other information in the header could be transferred without
change, especially Conventions, DateProcessed, ProjectName, Aircraft,
FlightDate (at start of data) and Defaults.  It would be nice to include
the RAF information, too (Source, Address, Phone).  Without some of this
information, these data really are incomplete.  For example, the attribute
DateProcessed can be used to verify that the data received are really the
final production data set.  The resulting netCDF file as it was delivered
to me does NOT conform to the Unidata-registered RAF convention.

Just my $.02 worth.

With delivery of the ACE-1 HRT MSS bitfile log, I think we have given
your group all that we owe you.  Do you know of anything else that you

Allen,

Last week, in addition to the HRT data, I archived to the SCD Mass Store
System (MSS) all the production support files for ACE-1 and changed to "read
only" all the NIMBUS support files in the ".../Proj/130" directory structure.
This should assure that subsequent users of NIMBUS will get the "production"
defaults loaded into their processing.

To keep things consistent I want to change the owner of the file "LRTFlight_5"
from you (allen) to the "nimbus" login.  If you allow owner and group write
permission on that file (chmod ug+w LRTFlight_5), I can do what else is
needed.  (Thanks)

With that task is finished, it will formally complete the ACE-1 project.

Allen,

I looked at the setup differences for RF11 to see what changes were made
between the two rates, and they were minor.  Therefore, the HRT setup is the
one I'd probably want to keep for the default (the setup that a user gets
when doing non-production processing).  When doing non-production processing,
NIMBUS defaults a non-production run to low-rate, so even if the "PRate=25"
stays in a Flight_X file, it will be ignored.  (Remember, one can always load
a setup file after NIMBUS is running to get a non-standard setup.)

jSo far as I am concerned, the setup files having names with "LRT" in them are
fine to keep as backups to document the LRT processing.  If you disagree with
this, please let me know; it is possible to juggle file names if you want.

These files have been archived to the MSS in their present form.  If we mess
with their names in the Production subdirectory, then we should add a README
file to explain the differences (or I should rearchive the support files).

Okay, you were right, there is an additional problem in 
our DBZ processing code.  The 260X concentrations are, in
fact, being output in number/L, and the equation Chris (our
software engineer) is using presently doesn't take this
into account for the 260X data.

Chris' equation is as follows:

dbz = log10(z * 1.0e6)

Now, the factor of 1.0e6 corrects the FSSP-100 data from number/cm3
to number/m3.  HOWEVER, this factor of 1.0e6 is WRONG for the
260X data.  This factor should, instead, be 1.0e3 for the 260X
data.  Hence, we are a factor of 3 (log10[10e3]) too high in
the case of the 260X data.

So, the correction factor for the 260X data should 10/3.  I.e.,
you will need to multipy the DBZ6_OBR values in the processed
files by 10/3.

Can you do me a favor?  Before I send out *another* broadcast
message to the SCMS PIs, can you try this out?  I.e., multiply
the values we distributed by 10/3 and see if this more closely
matches your calculations?  If this looks okay, I'll go ahead
and notify the rest of the PIs.

Oh, one more thing that you may be interested in.  In Chris'
code, the following "if" structure is used in calculating dbz
values:

if (z > 0.0)
    dbz = log10(z * 1.0e6)
else
    dbz= -100.0

So, it may be possible that some discrepancies between your
calculations and ours are due to the setting of dbz to -100.0
above under certain conditions.

Also, remember that it is possible that the actual bin diameter
values could have varied slightly over the course of the project
(due to the probe "slipping" out of calibration, etc.).  This
may account for some of the difference between your results and
ours.

Krista,

Thanks for your "heads' up" on this.  I didn't think about the different
concentration units for the 260X probe.  That, of course, makes the NIMBUS
dBZ calculation non-standard until Chris can get some kind of units flag
working for it.  I'll work with him on that.

Steve,

Thanks for your voice mail reply the other day.  I will try to remember the
codiac@ncar.ucar.edu email address in case I get more inquiries, such as, the
one from Jim Hudson.

Regarding the ACE-1 documentation:
   The two RAF Bulletins you mentioned (#9 and #23) are both out of print.
I am presently working on revising the old (vintage 1987) version of
Bulletin 9, and I hope to have it ready for internal review by the end of
this month.  Plans are afoot to transcribe the text from a printed version
of Bulletin 23 into a WordPerfect file sometime within the next few weeks.  
   All this activity is in anticipation of RAF revising all its Bulletins
and preparing them for the web.  Many of them are quite old and have obsolete
information, oftentimes referring to aircraft we no longer operate.
   In the actual summary documents sent to the PIs, Allen included printed
copies of Bulletins 9, 23 and 24 which we still have in stock.

Dear Dr. Huebert,

Allen Schanot asked that I reply to your email to him regarding the WINDS
software.

>

> arise:
> 
> 1.How can I go about getting a copy of it?

The fully copyrighted "beta" version of WINDS software is freely distributed
by NCAR's ATD.  For more information or to obtain the package, please contact
Michele Case [case@stout.atd.ucar.edu, (303)497-8756].

> 
> 2. Is it difficult to install and get running?

(Michele Case can answer this question better than I.)
Full installation instructions are provided with the software.  I understand
that it is straightforward and not complex.  It is designed to run on Sun
workstations running Solaris.  An older version for SunOS is quite obsolete.

> 
> 3. Is there a manual that will get us beyond the features we used on the
> C-130?

I'm not sure what features you used on the airplane, but the documentation you
receive with the software will describe all the features of WINDS.  A web site
describes WINDS, but I'm not sure how useful it will be to you.  Its URL is:
http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/winds/winds_home.html

> 
> 4. What format of data does it use on the ground? NetCDF? I'll order a
> copy of the data from OFPS in whatever format it is we need.

For ground-based applications, WINDS reads low-rate (LRT) netCDF files.  (It
will not work with the HRT data.)  You can order those data on-line from OFPS
via their interactive web site.  You can start with their home page and wend
your way through (URL = http://www.ofps.ucar.edu/) or go directly to the
projects and choose "ACE-1"
(URL = http://www.ofps.ucar.edu/cgi-bin/codiac/projs).  If you want to
contact a real person at OFPS, I'd suggest Steve Williams [sfw@ucar.edu,
(303)497-8164].

For this software to operate properly, you may need to obtain the netCDF
software from Unidata.  (It is also a free distribution.  See the URL
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/.  It is also available via
anonymous ftp from the machine `unidata.ucar.edu' in the `pub/netcdf'
directory with the name `netcdf.tar.Z.')

I hope this is enough to get you started.  If you need more information,
please contact me.

Darrel:  There seems to be a lot of confusion here.  The latest values you
	 gave this guy are simply the "default" bin cut sizes.  At least
	 I always assumed the values in the "Defaults" files were cut sizes.
	 Those are the values used in the ACE-1 processing, but that was an
	 error on my part.  The values appearing in the UCAR documentation
	 were, I thought, the mid range sizes from SCMS (a few typos got in
	 there).  The questtions now are:

	1) How does this code really work ( mean or cut sizes )?

	2) Given the overall accuracy of these measurements, are the 
	 	errors in DBARF & PLWCF really significant?

	3) What are the "calibrated" bin cut sizes for ACE-1?

Lets meet with Ron & Dick and hash this out.

I grabbed the C-130 documentation files for ACE-1 as we discussed
yesterday. We'll take a look at them and populate the HTML
page. If we have any questions I'll let you know. Send me an

 Seongsoo Yum:

I can now end all confusion on this issue.  The PMS data were processed
using the mean bin sizes that appear in the netCDF data set.  We are in the
process of changing the documentation currently residing in the UCAR ACE-1
web site.  The DISPX and DBZX variables are not standard outputs for all
RAF projects and were not included in the ACE-1 data set.  The bin size
values correspond to the MEAN particle size for that bin.  Remember to skip
the 1st value in the 16 value data array as the the 15 PMS size bins correspond
to array indices 2-16.

Sorry about the confusion.

Allen,

A user has pointed out that the netcdf file corresponding to
flight 2b, has the time field corrupted. The file indicates that
the tape started on 11/02 at 00:04. There was no flight at this time.
We checked the base_time field in the file and the tape log and
both are in error.

Could you please fix this file, as the error has also propagated to
the Greg Kok data sets.

Allen,
I'm not sure you understood what we meant. 

The NetCDF file containing the data for the second part of flight 2
has a variable called "base_time". Absolute time in the netCDF file is
obtained by adding time offset to base_time. Base_time is seconds
since midnight Jan 1, 1970. That field is wrong. In the flight in question,
the base_time number should be increased by 24 hours for flight 2b.
This makes it consistant with the rest of the flights.

Steve and Nimal

Steve, Nimal and Allen,

It looks like we do have an error in the file.  I will look into updating
the netCDF file for RF02B.  It should be the only one in error for the
ACE-1 project.

Steve and Nimal,

I have fixed the problem date (11/02/1995 --> 11/03/1995) and rearchived the
file on the SCD Mass Store System (MSS).  I will be updating some support
files in the MSS archive, as well, to reflect this change (MSS path =
/RAF/1996/130, files =  130.tar, 130.tar.dir, LRT/taplog.130, Mail.130).

Steve,

It was a quick fix, since we have a little program here whose specific
purpose is to change the date of a netCDF file.  I just retrieved the
bogus one from the MSS, changed it and archived it back.

I thought I copied you (steve@ofps.ucar.EDU) on the email, so I may have
gotten an incorrect address for you.  (If that's the case, then you won't
receive this reply.)

I changed some other archive files to reflect that change, and the earlier
email message had a new copy of the MSS Bitfile Log.  If you need it, I
can remail it.

Ron,
I received everything. We are in the process of changing nodes
since we merged with JICP/PO, but my old e-mail should work.
If ever in doubt, my "generic" e-mail of sfw@ucar.edu will
follow me to the ends of the earth (and it has!).

Ron,
I'm glad to hear that RAF is revising and digitizing the bulletins.
Let me know when they might be available, and we'll link to them
from ACE-1, either directly to your WWW page location or send us
digital copies. Will your WWW page also have GIF images of the
aircraft or any diagrams?

Thanks. Have a great weekend. By the way, did you hear OFPS was
merged with JICP/PO here in UCAR? I don't know yet the impact
although our new boss will be Karyn Sawyer. The new office name
has not been determined!

Steve,

Regarding the URL:  http://www.ofps.ucar.edu/data/ace_1/html/130_cov.html

Item 5:  In addition to the Bulletin 9 exerpt file describing the calculations
(Appendix B), there is a WordPerfect file with a list of references that
should be appended to it.  You can retrieve it from our anonymous ftp site
(pub/ACE-1/Nreferences.wp6).

Item 8:  To settle some user questions that have arisen regarding the FSSP,
There is a new, WordPerfect file with an updated calibration summary.  You
can retrieve it from our anonymous ftp site (pub/ACE-1/130.cal).

Item 10:  There is no corresponding documentation for this item in the
paper version of our Project Summary.  As it stands now, this Item briefly
describes the processed data and their availability.  One change that occurred
since this was posted is that the HRT data are now available on the MSS.
A statement referring to Item 1 (Mass Store Bitfile Log) is appropriate.
Also, I will include an example netCDF header for each of the data types.
Below this is a brief rewrite of this section.  (You will have to add the
hypertext links.)  I put the two netCDF header files on our anonymous ftp
site.  Their names are:
      pub/ACE-1/130rf01.hdr  (for the LRT example)
      pub/ACE-1/130rf20h.hdr (for the HRT example)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  Cut Here  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
10. Information on the Processed Data
<DD>     a) LRT netCDF data:  The LRT (Low-Rate Turbulence) data, consisting
of averaged, 1 sample per second (sps) values, will only be available on-line
from the official UCAR OFPS archive.  Click here to see an example netCDF
header.
<DD>     b) HRT netCDF data:  The HRT (High-Rate Turbulence) data, consisting
of mixed-rate values (1 sps to 25 sps, depending upon sensor response) is now
available on the SCD Mass Store System.  (See Item 1 for more information.)
Click here to see an example netCDF header.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  Cut Here  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Item 12:  There is a new file for you to retrieve.  The one you got, as I
mentioned to you on the phone yesterday, is incomplete.  The file name is the
same (pub/ACE-1/tapes.130), but it is now in two sections.  The first one has
info relative to the Mass Store, and the second one describes each physical
tape.

To:       ACE-1 C-130 Data Users

From:     Darrel Baumgardner and Richard Schillawski, NCAR/RAF

Subject:  Pressure Altitude Corrections

The pressure altitudes that have been archived in the general RAF C-130 data
set use a standard altitude reference pressure and temperature of 1013.246
mbar, 288.15K.  This often leads to pressure altitudes during flight that are
inaccurate, particularly during low level legs over the ocean.  The research
radar altimeter was not operatioal during ACE-1 so pressure altitude is the
only measure of altitude that we have.

We have now reprocessed Flights RF03 through RF30 and corrected the pressure
altitude.  The pressure altitude is being calculated by
     PALTC = (Tr/gamma)[1-(P/Pr)^X],
where Tr and Pr are sea level values of temperature and pressure, gamma is the
standard lapse rate, and X is R*gamma/g, where R is the universal gas constant
for dry air, and g is the acceleration of gravity.

Rather than use a single reference temperature and pressure, we use the
temperature and pressure at takeoff and landing as two reference points
(Anchorage, Honolulu, Xmas Island, Fiji, Christchurch and Hobarth were all
nearly at sea level +- 5 M).  We then found all flight legs that were flown at
100, 300 or 500 ft and determined the altimeter setting (surface pressure) at
these points using the transform
     PSURF = P*exp(g/R(HGM/Tbar),
where P is the pressure at the flight altitude, g and R are as defined above,
HGM is the altimeter reading from the pilots radar altimeter, and Tbar is
the average temperature between surface and flight altitude.  The surface
temperature was assumed to be the ocean temperature determined by the
Heinmann thermometer and flight level temperature was taken from the radome
right Rosemount probe.  The pilots had a working radar altimeter so we know
the low-level flight legs fairly precisely, at least within +/-5 M.

We interpolated linearly between all the surface pressures to get estimates
between the reference points.  These were then used in the corrected
calculation of pressure altitude given above.

A major caution:  Whereas we think that these new pressure altitudes are much
more accurate than the original values, there still will be some uncertainties
that result from the assumption of a standard lapse rate.  The values close
to the surface will be most accurate, and the uncertainty will increase with
increasing altitude. 

The lidar data are presently being processed to determine aircraft altitude
when the lidar was pointing downward.  These will be the most accurate height
data, once processed, and will be used to ascertain the accuracy of the
corrected pressure altitudes.  In the meantime, we are reluctant to place
an uncertainty estimate on the corrected altitude values.  We are probably
safe in saying that within the boundary layer, the corrected altitudes are
acccurate to within +/- 25M.

The archived data files are in compressed ascii format (gzipped), and for the
time, being can be found by ftp'ing to chinook.atd.ucar.edu (user = anonymous,
password = your email)

Change directory to pub/ace.

The files are listed as newaltRn.asc.gz, where n = flight #.

We are requesting that these files be put on codiac in the near future.

Steve:  You just received a set of "corrected" pressure altitude data for
	ACE-1 from Darrel Baumgardner.  These data should be considered as
	an "analysis" product of a PI and not be merged into the basic C-130 
	data set supported by RAF.  Any questions about these data should be
	directed to either Darrel or Dick Schillawski.  This analysis makes
	each flight unique with different, flight specific uncertainties for 
	PALTC.  When you release these data on codiac, please add the proper
	documentation to identify its nature and source.

Allen,

Thanks for sending out this email.  Dick and I talked a bit about something
like this last Friday after you left.  I looked at a couple of his data files
and found time periods when the airplane also was flying under water (negative
altitudes), so all is not pristine with their data, either.

I will put a copy of your email in my ACE-1 records (unless you rather I not).

Steve:  The SABL data from ACE-1 are now on-line through RSF/ATD as GIF

	http:/www.atd.ucar.edu/rsf/ACE1/sabl/sabl_ace1_tc.html

	I don't know how long RSF will maintain these files on-line or
	how you can get copies for the ACE-1 archive (I'm looking into
	this question).  I'm going to ask RSF for some sort of summary
	describing the data set, how it was processed, and how to interpret

Allen,
Thanks for "running this down". To expedite things, we will link
CODIAC to this address so everyone will have access by "clicking"
on this dataset from the CODIAC list. When you find documentation,
please e-mail it and we'll create a readme file. Then we can work
out the gory details of final resting place, etc.

The images look good. Will be interested to obtain some feedback
on the scientific uses of these products. This might help decide
whether to publish a CD ROM or not.

Also, add the digital data issue to your list, as some PIs have
expressed interest for it. But for now the imagery is a great help!

Thanks,
Steve Williams

Allen,

I have recovered the READ password for the protected MSS bitfiles for ACE-1.
All the documentation is in the directory:
     /home/local/proj/130/Production/archive/restricted/
which is accessible only by the "nimbus" login (and superuser).

Chris,

I had SCD MSS group remove the unknown read password from all the bitfiles
in the directory:  RAF/1996/130/PMS2D/

You may be finished using any of these files, but I know you complained
about not being able to retrieve them via MIGS last March.

Ron,
I received your additional ACE-1 tapes and checked our inventory.
Apparently, there are several more missing, but I'm not sure whether
they are laying around RAF or never existed. In any event, the following
is a list of missing ACE-1 tapes in case you wish to post a APB
out for them at RAF:

   RF01 10/31/1995 Forward (Tape ? of ?) Flight completely missing
   RF02 11/02/1995 Forward (Tape ? of ?) Flight completely missing
   RF11 11/17/1995 Forward (Tape 2 of 2)
   RF15 11/24/1995 Forward (Tape 1 of 2)
   RF16 11/26/1995 Forward (Tape 1 of 2)
   RF19 12/02/1995 Forward (Tape 2 of 2)
   RF22 12/05/1995 Forward (Tape 1 of 2)
   RF29 12/15/1995 Forward (Tape 2 of 2)
   RF33 12/22/1995 Forward (Tape ? of ?) Flight completely missing

Hope this helps. Have a great weekend!

Steve
