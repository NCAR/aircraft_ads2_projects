This directory contains the C-shell script used to archive to the SCD Mass
Store System (MSS) certain SCMS project data files with READ passwords to
limit their access.  Since no access is possible without using the correct
READ password, it is imperative that the passwords be documented somewhere,
so this is the place.

As of Mon Apr 21 15:55:36 MDT 1997,
 these bitfiles        have this associated READ password:
   /RAF/1996/130/PMS2D/RFx                       1-ECA
    where:  x = flight number and possible segment
