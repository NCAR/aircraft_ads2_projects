Subject: Leonids Mission Summary
Status: RO

All:

I attach an informative summary of the successful Leonids mission
circulated by Peter Jenniskens of NASA/SETI.  This makes a nice
accompaniment to the thanks and admiration expressed for ATD's
outstanding support of the program by Peter and Chet Gardner of
U.  of Illinois. 

Congratulations to all.

Paul

> LEONID '98 AIRBORNE MISSION
> 
> Status of project as of November 24, 1998
> ========================================
> 
> 1. BRIEF SUMMARY OF MISSION RESULTS
> 
> The Leonid Multi-Instrument Aircraft Campaign proceeded according to plan,
> with both the NSF (NCAR) Lockheed Electra and the USAF  (452nd FTS) KC-135
> FISTA executing their missions from Kadena AFB in Okinawa in the night of
> November 17 (with strong local support at Kadena AFB). 
> 28 scientists onboard, seven nationalities from Universities, 
> government and private institutions, and a total of 46 including crew
> and media, witnessed an intense shower of Leonid meteors.  
> 
> The meteors were probed by lidar, imaging and spectroscopic techniques
> covering  the UV, visible, near-Infrared and mid-Infrared. All instruments 
> performed as planned, and there were no last-minute drop-outs. Instead,
> we accomodated Alan Stern (of SWRI, Boulder) on the FISTA team, who 
> performed intensified imaging and gave support to help point Ray
> Russell's BASS mid-IR spectrometer to persistent trains. 
> 
> The Leonid shower returned with a bang. Numerous bright fireballs were
> reported in the day and a half leading up to our mission. On mission-date
> itself, rates had decreased slightly, but an intense shower was 
> observed with Zenith Hourly Rates of about 200. The shower was rich
> in faint meteors, unlike the prior night, from which we suspect that we
> did witness the storm component.
> 
> Some 30 iron debris trails were 
> detected by lidar, compared to a typical 1-2 trails/night under normal 
> conditions, and excellent HD-TV imaging was obtained in parallel for studies 
> of iron chemistry and physical processes in the train. One of the two lidar
> beams was tuned off the iron resonance line to detect Rayleigh scattering
> from potential dust. No strong dust signal was detected, as expected, and
> such detection awaits further data analysis. The intensified cameras mapped
> the shower's flux distribution around the position of the expected storm, and
> they measured the flux distribution, which was markedly different from that
> reported one night earlier. A number of meteors were recorded from both
> aircraft simultaneously for the measurement of trajectories and orbits. At
> least one long-lasting persistent train was imaged from both aircraft in
> high resolution and turbulent motion was for the first time detected. This
> train was also studied by the near-IR spectrographs and we have good hopes
> to have obtained the first 1-3 micron spectroscopy of a meteor train (and
> meteors in general for that matter) from these measurements. The Ames CCD
> camera recorded six spectra, two of which do show excited atmospheric
> molecular bands for the study of excitation temperatures in the meteor.
> Jiri Borovicka estimated to have recorded some 50 UV/Visible spectra for
> main element abundances. Ian Murray reported many trails at high resolution
> for studies of meteor ablation and fragmentation properties. And Gary
> Swenson reported numerous trails detected with the airglow imager for
> flux measurements at the bright meteor end.  
> 
> It seems that we achieved some 70% of our science objectives. We were not
> able to aim the University of East Anglia telescope at a persistent train:
> none was suitably located, and we do not know yet if the mid-IR spectrometers
> were successful. We are also in doubt if we can study the mass-dependence
> of ejection velocities from the flux measurements, but that may still be
> possible if a narrow peak is detected. Clearly, a meteor storm would have
> given much more data for all instruments. In hindsight, we could have 
> obtained significantly more data on persistent trains if we would have had
> the funds and the opportunity (no curfew and no constraints due to crew rest)
> to do a mission in the night of November 16.
> 
> All in all, we are very happy. We did not see a storm, but we did see one
> of the best showers ever and we obtained a lot of exciting data.
> This year's return was almost identical to the return of 1965 when the broad
> component of bright meteors peaked some 13 hours before nodal passage as it
> did this year. In 1965, there was a narrow component of faint meteors just
> after the time of nodal passage. This raises hopes that next year will be a
> return of the storm of November 1966. Peak activity is expected over Europe
> and Africa (not over Illinois - sorry Chet, earlier rumours of very high
> rates over the Canary Islands turned out to be merely group counts).  
> 
> 
> 2. GROUND-BASED EFFORTS
> 
> The airborne campaign directly motivated ground-based observing
> efforts in China, the USA and Europe. Several of those ground-based
> efforts were wildly successful, notably a ground-based lidar
> of Chet Gardner used in an effort by Mike Kelly of Cornell University
> at Kirtland AFB in New Mexico, 
> and the groundbased effort of multi-station photography in China,
> performed by the Dutch Meteor Society in collaboration with the
> Nanjing Observatory (and Beijing Observatory). 
> 
> Both ground-based teams in China (at Xinlong Station and near Delingha)
> had clear weather on all important nights and obtained numerous
> multi-station meteors by two-station photography  and intensified video.
> These meteors are typically brighter than those recorded by the HD-TV
> cameras on the mission and results are complimentary for an analysis
> of radiant dispersions as a function of meteoroid mass.  
> In addition flux information was obtained that complements the 
> counts made by intensified video techniques from the airborne platforms
> one and two timezones earlier, respectively. 
> 
> The ground-based effort to probe meteor persistent trains with a
> sodium lidar from the Starfire range at Kirtland AFB in New Mexico
> was wildely successful. The lidar was pointed at several trains, one
> of which was detected for 20 minutes, another for 30 minutes. These
> data on meteor trains nicely compliment the lidar detections of the
> meteors  themselves obtained on the aircraft.
> 
> A very nice image of the Leonid shower was obtained by one of the
> all-sky cameras of the European Network of Pavel Spurny, who was 
> participating in our ground-based campaign in China. Although most of
> the EN stations were clouded out, this station in the Slovak Republic
> recorded 156 trails on a 4.1 hour exposure. See our website for the result.  
> 
> We are only beginning to sift through the data. There is clearly 
> plenty of material for our workshop in April and I have no doubt that some
> exciting new insight will emerge in the coming months when the
> data reduction is performed. At this moment, we all need some rest,

Via today's noon mail pickup at Jeffco I am sending you the following
eleven (11) 8mm tapes for archiving to the SCD Mass Store System:
 
     R1185 - R1188 and R1225 - R1231
 
Please be aware that these tapes are for "read only."  Unlike ordinary
audio and video tapes, a black "hole" actually makes these tapes writeable.
Therefore, the red, write-enable flag will be in the exposed (ERASE OFF)
position.  Do NOT change the position of this flag.  If a tape seems to
be write enabled, contact me immediately.
 
Please let me know when they are ready to read.
Thanks.  :)

Ron,

The reception desk here at the Mesa called at 0800
this morning and said your 8mm tapes had arrived.

I now have them in the computer room, so feel
free to run your jobs at any time.

Bruce,

I have archived to the SCD Mass Store System the raw ADS tapes for the
1998-807 Leonids project (RF01 - RF11).  Summary information files can be
found in the directory:  /home/local/proj/807/Production/
files:
     MSCP_out.807   <-- verbose
     tp2ms.summary  <-- capsule

If you don't need these tapes at Jeffco for awhile and if it's OK with you,
I'd like to use them for testing SCD's new import software.

Bruce,

Today I archived to the SCD Mass Store System (MSS) the production netCDF data
files as well as all support files in the project's 807 directory.

Should I distribute these data to anyone via magnetic tape, or have you made
other arrangements?

Do you still have the master aircraft data tapes?  If so, do you still need
them?  If not, where are they located?

Here is a MSS directory list of all files archived for this project:

Chet and Peter,

Bruce Morley asked me to write you.  The Electra flight-level data are now
available for the Leonids-98 project.  They have been archived to the NCAR/SCD
Mass Store System (MSS).  You can access them there or RAF can distribute
these data via anonymous ftp or magnetic tape.  Our "standard" mag tape is
high-density 8mm (Exabyte) tape, but we can accomodate other media.

The data are in netCDF format.  Please give me your specifications and
shipping address.

Here is a list of the data files archived to the MSS.

Ron,

Would it be OK if we do the anonymous ftp to get Electra position data?
Before we did it from the ftp address at: raf.atd.ucar.edu

Thank!


WEilin

Bruce,

I don't know how it happened, but I seemingly lost your email message
having the email addresses of the data recipients for Leonids.  Could
you please send that message again?  (If you cannot, please give me
their names again, and I'll go searching.)

Thanks.

Bruce,

I got a phone call this morning from U Illinois (Xinzhao Chu) who has an
*immediate* need for the data from Leonids98 and AMTS.  As you know, the
scrubber was removing files from the ftp area without sending any email
warning messages.  (I fixed that problem yesterday!)

I was able to restore the Leonids98 netCDF files, and, based on an email
you sent to Xinzhao, which she forwarded to me, I copied the AMTS production
netCDF files to the ftp site, too.  I also gave them the URL for Unidata's
netCDF.

Apparently from Leonids98 you made some ASCII files available to Gardner
and company.  Is there a way to restore them?  Are you planning to create
ASCII files from AMTS, too?

They seemed to "need the data immediately" and were retrieving the files as I
was restoring them to the ftp site and talking on the phone.

I hope that you wanted the AMTS data released, since that's effectively what
I have done.
