[GMT 03/27/06 13:55:33] <DataSystem-c130> Hi Chris.  We are having problems with the new board.  We try and change things but the console port seems to lock up and not accept input?  Any suggestions?
[GMT 03/27/06 13:56:07] <DataSystem-c130> We have to contunially power off the DSM.  
[GMT 03/27/06 13:56:57] <DataSystem-c130> Is there a way to edit the current field or do we just need to type in the new data?
[GMT 03/27/06 14:01:19] <ChrisWebster> I don't believe you can edit the field.  If you make a mistake you have to hit return through all the questions and press 'c' again to start over.  Also do a 'p' before reboot to verify they look good.
[GMT 03/27/06 14:01:43] <ChrisWebster> Lock up: ??? : can you type anything?
[GMT 03/27/06 14:01:56] <DataSystem-c130> Okay, we were hoping for a hort cut.
[GMT 03/27/06 14:02:01] <DataSystem-c130> It 
[GMT 03/27/06 14:02:33] <DataSystem-c130> Yes, I cannot type anything. 
[GMT 03/27/06 14:02:53] <DataSystem-c130> It's like the port freezes up.
[GMT 03/27/06 14:03:01] <ChrisWebster> can you do the 'c' even?
[GMT 03/27/06 14:03:26] <DataSystem-c130> No I cannot type anything. Even return does nothing.
[GMT 03/27/06 14:03:42] <ChrisWebster> were able to stop the boot process?
[GMT 03/27/06 14:05:01] <DataSystem-c130> I can stop the boot process.  I can even start making changes but it locks up in the middles of a change and I cannot continue.  We have had to reboot the DSM many times and only gotten 1 vaule changed.
[GMT 03/27/06 14:06:13] <ChrisWebster> I don't know what the problem is.  Your other option is to find a laptop with minicom or hyperterminal on it and connect that directly to the motherboard...
[GMT 03/27/06 14:07:27] <DataSystem-c130> kay we will try and get the console port to work. The biggest problem is the path names because they are so long. 
[GMT 03/27/06 14:08:31] <ChrisWebster> 10-4.
[GMT 03/27/06 14:08:56] <ChrisWebster> I'm at home right now, going to poweroff in a few minutes and in to work.

[GMT 03/27/06 14:10:38] <DataSystem-c130> It seems to give me more time to type if I leave it off for a few minutes.  I think we can get it done via the consle here.
[GMT 03/27/06 14:10:46] <DataSystem-c130> It just night take a little while.

[GMT 03/27/06 14:19:43] <AlSchanot-ops> Hello Boys.  The MILAGRO T-shirts are here.  Only L's & M's.  I have stashed some away for everyone.  
[GMT 03/27/06 14:20:18] <AlSchanot-ops> How are things going?
[GMT 03/27/06 14:20:27] <DataSystem-c130> Thanks Al. 
[GMT 03/27/06 14:21:13] <AlSchanot-ops> If anyone is NOT interested, let me know so I can put some back in the pile
[GMT 03/27/06 14:21:29] <DataSystem-c130> We are making progress.  The RW is fine and continues to work.  We are having troubles getting the LW cpu setup but it is only a matter of time I think.
[GMT 03/27/06 14:22:10] <DataSystem-c130> Okay, I'll check with the crew out here.  I'm sure the techs that went back would also be interested.
[GMT 03/27/06 14:22:16] <AlSchanot-ops> Good.  I'm still waiting for Jose so we can set up tomoorw's flt with the airport authorities
[GMT 03/27/06 14:23:00] <AlSchanot-ops> I got the first crew covered.  Not sure Allbee will fit in a Large!
[GMT 03/27/06 14:23:19] <AlSchanot-ops> Or Larry either - but that is as big as they run

[GMT 03/27/06 14:30:14] <DataSystem-c130> Actually I thinkeveryone would like a large.
[GMT 03/27/06 14:31:55] <AlSchanot-ops> We are headed to the airport now.  Need anything?
[GMT 03/27/06 14:33:40] <DataSystem-c130> No I think we are okay.
