[GMT 03/12/06 22:42:21] <AlSchanot-ops> That's really dry air - pushing the limit at these temps
[GMT 03/12/06 22:42:28] <adsCockpit-c130> please confirm wall between 21, -99 and POZ
[GMT 03/12/06 22:42:42] <DannyOpsRm2> Frank If possible continue to E2 at FL125 then turn to head for IC3

[GMT 03/12/06 22:44:10] <adsCockpit-c130> is E2 -99 and 21???????
[GMT 03/12/06 22:44:34] <DannyOpsRm2> from IC3 suggest a wall between IC3 and IC4.

[GMT 03/12/06 23:21:24] <DonCollins-ops> JC, good thing we have the FMPS.  Turn off the DMA sheath flow blower using the mechanical switch labeled "Qsh DMA" attached to the plexiglass.  
[GMT 03/12/06 23:23:27] <DMT-C130> Don, I did it. Do u want to restart it later?
[GMT 03/12/06 23:28:02] <DonCollins-ops> JC, just to clarify, the TDMA is still running, right?  If so, there is no need to restart. 
[GMT 03/12/06 23:29:20] <adsCockpit-c130> we saw some stuff here at 1150 between 21, -99 and IC3

[GMT 03/12/06 23:29:40] <adsCockpit-c130> there is a dark plume ahead. we'll go to 13500 and try and hit it
[GMT 03/12/06 23:30:41] <adsCockpit-c130> might be higher hard to tell
[GMT 03/12/06 23:32:06] <DMT-C130> Don, the tdma is fine. I was asking u if u want to switch dma Qsh later?
[GMT 03/12/06 23:35:34] <DonCollins-ops> JC, it wouldn't be easy to re-zero, so we'll go TDMA-only for the remainder of the flight
