[GMT 03/22/06 17:04:34] <adsCockpit-c130> \question is how likely is it that WRF is as much as 1 degree off in the N/S but ab out right in the E/W location
[GMT 03/22/06 17:05:01] <davidk_veracruz> frank, i suggest a no-cal for NOy until you hit clear air, then cal. these are easier to predict. fewer requests to Eric this way.
[GMT 03/22/06 17:05:03] <DannyOpsRm1> Yes frank I agree with you revised positions you must have missed my comments.

[GMT 03/22/06 17:07:51] <DannyOpsRm1> Frank there is a line of coinverction roughly alingned with the coast but dosplaced by a degree or so 
[GMT 03/22/06 17:09:09] <DannyOpsRm1> there seems to be a different airmass the the east with much lower convection to the east and cloud free
[GMT 03/22/06 17:15:04] <adsCockpit-c130> Thx. we are starting to see stuff now
[GMT 03/22/06 17:17:30] <davidk_veracruz> could have cal'd NOy at 17:00 from what i'm seeing
[GMT 03/22/06 17:19:13] <adsCockpit-c130> just put the plume switch on it was on auto-cal before 1715. if you don't like what we do you need to fly
