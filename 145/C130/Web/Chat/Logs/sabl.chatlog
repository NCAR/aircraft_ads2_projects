Feb 28 16:32:07 -->	bruce (Bruce@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) has joined &SABL
Feb 28 16:33:03 <bruce>	Ron, are you there?
Feb 28 16:39:43 <sabl-C130>	hi bruce. good fligt so far. almost to 1 hour mark.
Feb 28 16:40:29 <bruce>	good, Not much going on here - everyone waiting
Feb 28 16:40:59 <sabl-C130>	any shipments arrive yet
Feb 28 16:41:30 <bruce>	Only people - no shipments yet
Feb 28 16:42:20 <sabl-C130>	i do not want to do any heavy lifting,,,, you and jonathan need to get all that done before i arrive
Feb 28 16:42:56 <sabl-C130>	just joking
Feb 28 16:43:17 <bruce>	We did a couple of 12 oz curls last night - nothing heavy for us either
Feb 28 16:44:37 <sabl-C130>	i need some 12 oz trainting before the big stuff
Feb 28 16:45:04 <sabl-C130>	it was to be 70 in boulder today. almost as nice as veracruz
Feb 28 16:45:35 <sabl-C130>	it is a little hard to find the beach, though
Feb 28 16:46:17 <bruce>	True, I know where the beach (and pool) are here.  I see both from my balcony!
Feb 28 16:47:02 <bruce>	Watch for the 2 minute bands in the data.  Wondering how long we can fly high before they start.
Feb 28 16:47:11 <sabl-C130>	have you gotten your airport badges? was it a hassle
Feb 28 16:47:44 <sabl-C130>	oh the bands are there, almost from the start.
Feb 28 16:48:00 <bruce>	No stinking badges yet.  Will try to get them just before you get here (with Al S's help)
Feb 28 16:48:33 <bruce>	Sorry to here that.  Do they correlate with laser coolent temp?
Feb 28 16:48:49 <sabl-C130>	lets hope the badges are smaller than 5x7
Feb 28 16:49:20 <sabl-C130>	i have been reading my paperback. i cant do everything
Feb 28 16:50:29 <bruce>	Sorry to ask you about the temps!  I forgot what the fine print in the sabl ops job description limits me to ask you
Feb 28 16:53:37 <sabl-C130>	the temps range from 29.5 to 35.7. it takes about 50 seconds to go from low/hi or hi/low..
Feb 28 16:54:45 <sabl-C130>	complete cycle is just short of 2 minutes
Feb 28 16:54:54 <bruce>	If we can figure out how to keep the temp more stable, we can get rid of the bands.  Probably not a field fix.
Feb 28 16:56:04 <sabl-C130>	i do not look at the green much. i have told frank to just enlarge and use the ir in the cockpit. he can see more detail if just using one display.
Feb 28 16:57:01 <sabl-C130>	this is definately not a field fix. we missed our opportunity a couple months ago.
Feb 28 16:58:14 <bruce>	I agree.  Watch later in the flight to see if you can see the Mexico City plume.  It wasn't a pretty sight yesterday.
Feb 28 17:00:32 <sabl-C130>	we could use some flight track display at our station. right now we have some stuff, probably just water.
Feb 28 17:01:04 <sabl-C130>	just over an hour into flt. probably in new mexico
Feb 28 17:01:37 <sabl-C130>	only 4.5 more hours!!!!!!!!!!!
Feb 28 17:01:39 <bruce>	No ads displays that you can see from the sabl seat?
Feb 28 17:03:05 <sabl-C130>	the ads is setup for the chem info
Feb 28 17:04:09 <sabl-C130>	if the pollution is real bad i might see it on the forward camera
Feb 28 17:04:46 <bruce>	I will check with the RAF computer gurus and see if we can put an ads window on sabl.
Feb 28 17:05:23 <bruce>	In Mexico City it would be obvious in the forward camera.
Feb 28 17:05:52 <sabl-C130>	we probably should have gotten their mapping software for a high power window
Feb 28 17:07:28 <sabl-C130>	the good flight track stuff might be too expensive for us
Feb 28 17:08:53 <sabl-C130>	the optics heater is keeping it at 30. not bad considering alt and temps
Feb 28 17:09:40 <bruce>	Sometimes the RAF maps have political boundarys on them.  What is the outside temp?
Feb 28 17:10:04 <sabl-C130>	the cabin, at least the sabl station, is plenty hot. there is no air moving in this area. 
Feb 28 17:11:18 -->	bruce_ (Bruce@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) has joined &SABL
Feb 28 17:11:31 <sabl-C130>	if the ac can not keepup at this alt we are going to be real uncomfortable flying low for extended periods.
Feb 28 17:12:40 <--	bruce has quit (Ping timeout)
Feb 28 17:12:52 <bruce_>	That won't be fun.
Feb 28 17:14:28 -->	bruce__ (Bruce@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) has joined &SABL
Feb 28 17:15:34 <bruce__>	I don't know why my name is getting longer.
Feb 28 17:16:26 <--	bruce_ has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
Feb 28 17:16:44 <sabl-C130>	there is something goofy with this keyboard. sometimes it enters TF02 from some memory or keyshortcut. TF02 is tTF02    est flight .....there is just did it
Feb 28 17:17:34 <sabl-C130>	bruce. are you TF02    both TF02    bruces or is someone TF02    on TF02    your other computer
Feb 28 17:18:46 <bruce__>	I don't know what is going on there.  We can email Charlie or talk to someone here after you arrive.
Feb 28 17:21:02 <sabl-C130>	the tf02 happens when i hit the space bar... and maybe some other key at the same time that i am not aware of. 
Feb 28 17:21:32 <bruce__>	Ah, the mysteries of computers!
Feb 28 17:22:43 <sabl-C130>	this keyboard is just alittle high and TF02    hard to type sometimes
Feb 28 17:26:08 <sabl-C130>	i got TF02    your cd's in the TF02    rack box. we will have to TF0TF02     2    sneak them in. they are on the no import list. 
Feb 28 17:30:04 <bruce__>	Thanks.  I hope to back up some sabl data to the DVDs.  There are many 'TF02's in your last entry.  Don't you just love computers!
Feb 28 17:32:50 <sabl-C130>	now this has seemed to buffered previous typing and sometimes puts out a long string of prior text
Feb 28 17:34:24 <sabl-C130>	now the nsa knows we are sneaking your dvds into mexico. the federallies (sp) will be waiting
Feb 28 17:34:25 <bruce__>	Now I remember why I am not a computer system admin person.
Feb 28 17:34:51 <bruce__>	They are in your hands, not mine!
Feb 28 17:37:05 <sabl-C130>	i will rat you out in i got TF02    your cd's in the TF02    rack box. we will have to TF0TF02     2    sneak them in. they a heartbeat
Feb 28 17:39:54 <bruce__>	Only 4 TF04's in the last line!
Feb 28 17:39:55 <sabl-C130>	if janet is there you can tell her that the ads laptop on sabl keeps timing out.
Feb 28 17:40:40 <bruce__>	I will tell her when I see her.  I am in my room!  The ops center is a vacant room as nothing has arrived yet.
Feb 28 17:42:36 <sabl-C130>	i will let the raf tech know, he can log it.
Feb 28 17:44:33 <bruce__>	I am also thinking about requesting that the sabl channel chats be logged as well.
Feb 28 17:45:08 <bruce__>	The C130Q chat channel is logged but right now the sabl channel isn't.
Feb 28 17:46:08 <sabl-C130>	i thought all channels were logged
Feb 28 17:48:11 <bruce__>	they can be but at this time sabl isn't.  Ron Ruth didn't know who made the decision not to log sabl chat but we can work on that.
Feb 28 17:50:03 <sabl-C130>	just having the nsa logging this is enough for me
Feb 28 17:51:15 <bruce__>	agreed.  I heard today that homeland security wanted to look at the shipments as they left the US on their way here.
Feb 28 17:51:23 <bruce__>	Aren't rumors fun!
Feb 28 17:56:18 <sabl-C130>	at 17:50 it looks like we might have lit up an aircraft. we have jumped from 20k to 23k ft to go through a military excersies area. might have got a fighter.
Feb 28 17:57:33 <sabl-C130>	that would be a first for me on sabl. we light up aircraft all the time with spol.
Feb 28 17:59:13 <sabl-C130>	if we get a fighter escort it might be from shining into their cockpit.
Feb 28 18:06:52 <bruce__>	Good luck in having the pilot aim sabl!
Feb 28 18:08:02 <sabl-C130>	dont you mean aim at sabl. they will just shoot it off the wing
Feb 28 18:09:30 <sabl-C130>	laser guided missle seeking laser source
Feb 28 18:19:49 <bruce__>	Do we have any other self defence that sabl?  I want the C130 pilot to be able to aim sabl.
Feb 28 18:20:24 <bruce__>	Can Errol put a dropsonde in their way?
Feb 28 18:20:38 <sabl-C130>	if we had the dropsonde we could throw things at them
Feb 28 18:21:11 <bruce__>	What ever fits into the drop tube will work - be creative!
Feb 28 18:21:29 <bruce__>	I am glad that this isn't being logged!
Feb 28 18:21:57 <bruce__>	I may have to change my chat name
Feb 28 18:23:01 <sabl-C130>	decending now, no more miltary. another half hour to the border.
Feb 28 18:23:50 <sabl-C130>	the GV would have been there and back by now
Feb 28 18:24:31 <bruce__>	and doing it in style!!
Feb 28 18:25:16 <sabl-C130>	yeah, they have a real toilet
Feb 28 18:25:51 <bruce__>	at least we moved away from it!!
Feb 28 18:27:25 <sabl-C130>	it finally got to a comfortable temp here at 23k ft
Feb 28 18:31:31 <bruce__>	Is it comfortable for you or the lidar?
Feb 28 18:32:56 <sabl-C130>	for me!
Feb 28 18:33:27 <bruce__>	What about poor SABL?
Feb 28 18:35:43 <sabl-C130>	you want me to say it? who cares about the stinking pod, we dont need no stinking pod 
Feb 28 18:36:57 <bruce__>	That's what I would say.
Feb 28 18:49:48 <sabl-C130>	we just did a low alt pass for 6 minutes. green channel noise looks good, no cycling 18:41-18:48. temp steady at 36.3-37.0
Feb 28 18:49:59 <sabl-C130>	alt was 3000 ft
Feb 28 19:02:26 <bruce__>	Sounds good.  Looking up or down?

Mar 04 18:07:06 <sabl-C130>	engines spinning, we will be off soon.
Mar 04 18:07:22 <Bruce_M-Veracruz>	At least you have power and are on the plane.  Have a good flight.
Mar 04 18:14:10 <Bruce_M-Veracruz>	Still sitting on the ramp?
Mar 04 18:21:42 <Bruce_M-Veracruz>	Let me know when you are in the air.

Mar 04 18:34:45 <BruceM-Veracruz>	Strange network at this end.  How are things going up there?
Mar 04 18:43:49 <sabl-C130>	Bruce, not good.  I get a fault window, digitzer errror, no interrupts.
Mar 04 18:44:10 <sabl-C130>	I have tried killing the windows a few times, no luck.  Any ideas?
Mar 04 18:45:18 <BruceM-Veracruz>	Not right now.  Can you cycle the pod power without affecting anyone else?
Mar 04 18:46:30 <BruceM-Veracruz>	If you can't cycle power - reboot the pod.
Mar 04 18:47:10 <sabl-C130>	yes, i will try.  how about cycling power on the rack cpu?
Mar 04 18:47:22 <sabl-C130>	i have cycled vme several times.
Mar 04 18:49:24 <BruceM-Veracruz>	This could be a safety radar fault.  Are you 2000 meters above ground level?
Mar 04 18:50:33 <BruceM-Veracruz>	After take off you have to enable altitude safety buttons on left side of sabl control.
Mar 04 18:51:02 <BruceM-Veracruz>	Two new buttons from Charlie.  Both have to be changed after takeoff.
Mar 04 18:52:39 <sabl-C130>	bruce, got it to work.  had to cycle all power on the pod.
Mar 04 18:53:33 <BruceM-Veracruz>	Good work.  I hope the other pod users didn't mind.
Mar 04 18:54:03 <BruceM-Veracruz>	Any wierd keyboard repeats in xchat?
Mar 04 18:55:27 <sabl-C130>	Keyboard repeats in xchat? I don't think so.
Mar 04 18:56:00 <BruceM-Veracruz>	I guess it just Mike's fat fingers.  He is back at the ops center with me.
Mar 04 19:00:21 <sabl-C130>	I cycled everything in the pod except for PMS Pod power.  Has this happened on any of the test flights?
Mar 04 19:00:38 <BruceM-Veracruz>	Mike says no.
Mar 04 19:01:16 <sabl-C130>	Must be the Mexico air.
Mar 04 19:01:34 <BruceM-Veracruz>	I am going to grab a quick bite to eat.  Mike is here to keep you entertained.

Mar 04 19:31:07 <sabl-C130>	I sure am, how about you?
Mar 04 19:34:07 <BruceM-Veracruz>	trying to keep from nodding off
Mar 04 19:34:51 <BruceM-Veracruz>	i found on the ferry that it is hardly worth it to turn on the laser until about 10 minutes
Mar 04 19:35:19 <sabl-C130>	There is some nice black air out there.  The green channel is seeing a lot!
Mar 04 19:35:46 <BruceM-Veracruz>	into the flight. there is so much safety cutoff during the climb and getting on station that you are not doing much
Mar 04 19:37:39 <BruceM-Veracruz>	i think that if you did everything right that the vx must have been whacked. it was probably something else like not setting the two buttons on charlies new alt thing. or being faked out and the red light was on.
Mar 04 19:38:16 <sabl-C130>	I waited just over 10 min and the limits where good, but still had problems.
Mar 04 19:38:25 <BruceM-Veracruz>	any time you get a safety condition the digitizer will stop and red light comes on.
Mar 04 19:38:53 <BruceM-Veracruz>	it could also be the radar altimiter was not on or was having problems.
Mar 04 19:40:21 <sabl-C130>	I got hte two buttons and reset the vx works and saw SABL control connect to vx works in window.
Mar 04 19:40:40 <sabl-C130>	Radar looked good too.
Mar 04 19:41:52 <BruceM-Veracruz>	sometimes the system justs like you to sweat at the beginning of the flight.
Mar 04 19:44:51 <sabl-C130>	going into the smog for a "missed approach" at a small airport.  Key board is acting up a little.  Type letters and get numbers.  Only happened 2 times.
Mar 04 19:46:08 <BruceM-Veracruz>	that was what it was doing on me. also repeated a message line from some memory .
Mar 04 19:47:14 <sabl-C130>	wierd
Mar 04 19:52:22 <BruceM-Veracruz>	eric has said that particular keyboard type can get mouse clicks from the track ball from vibration.
Mar 04 20:06:33 <BruceM-Veracruz>	This is Bruce - back from lunch.  Lots of signal in the green - how about the IR?
Mar 04 20:07:20 <BruceM-Veracruz>	The 'air' shipment from RAF (including SABL) should be in tonight.
Mar 04 20:13:12 <sabl-C130>	The ir is good too.  I wll believe it when I see it (air shipment).
Mar 04 20:13:12 <sabl-C130>	Giting harder to type, it is bumpy.
Mar 04 20:15:43 <BruceM-Veracruz>	You must be in the boundary layer or at least somewhat low.

Mar 04 20:30:05 <BruceM-Veracruz>	Jonathan, plan to bring the data disks with you when you get back.
Mar 04 20:30:42 <BruceM-Veracruz>	We may have the ground system up tomorrow (eternal optimist here) and I can look at data.
Mar 04 20:38:07 <BruceM-Veracruz>	You are back.  Did you see my request about data disks?
Mar 04 20:40:03 <sabl-C130>	I saw your request and I will bring back the data disks.
Mar 04 20:40:28 <BruceM-Veracruz>	thank you.  Don't know how well chat is holding up during all your turns.
Mar 04 20:41:36 <sabl-C130>	Doesn't seem to like the turns.
Mar 04 20:42:53 <sabl-C130>	We are also at 15500 ft now.  We where at 9500 ft.
Mar 04 20:44:12 <BruceM-Veracruz>	Safety limits turn the laser off with roll angles greater than 5 degrees.
Mar 04 20:46:27 <BruceM-Veracruz>	Any banding in the green data?
Mar 04 20:49:37 <sabl-C130>	Yes, the limits are aat 5 degrees.  I saw some banding at the beginning of the flight, before the greater concentration of polution.
Mar 04 20:50:59 <sabl-C130>	Now there is a lot of return and it is really hard to see the banding.  I wonder if we can see it better post processing.
Mar 04 20:53:55 <BruceM-Veracruz>	We probably won't see it.  The banding is at very low signal levels.
Mar 04 20:55:04 <sabl-C130>	That's good.
Mar 04 20:56:14 <BruceM-Veracruz>	I am gong to move from the data center to my room.  Be back in a few minutes.

Mar 04 21:19:21 <sabl-C130>	4 hours, ya.  Everything is going well.
Mar 04 21:22:34 <BruceM-Veracruz>	You are quite a ways east of Mexico City.
Mar 04 21:27:47 <sabl-C130>	Yes we are, we are about to turn around, and fly a little lower., through a "nice" layer.
Mar 04 21:29:41 <BruceM-Veracruz>	I don't know if a layer you can see is 'nice'.
Mar 04 21:34:35 <sabl-C130>	It is a "nice" black layer.
Mar 04 21:38:18 <sabl-C130>	Denver's brown cloud is a joke compared to here.

Mar 08 18:35:55 <ericloew>	\NICK ericloew_NCAR
Mar 08 18:36:53 ---	ericloew is now known as ericloew_NCAR
Mar 08 18:37:50 <sabl-C130>	done that
Mar 08 18:38:38 <ericloew_NCAR>	So, HGM32 is updating and SABL is not?
Mar 08 18:39:08 <sabl-C130>	everything is going wrong today. the ir looks like it is barely working, can only see the ground, nothing else
Mar 08 18:39:53 <Bruce_M_Veracruz>	Any green signal?
Mar 08 18:42:00 <sabl-C130>	green is its usual looking, maybe down a little
Mar 08 18:43:57 <ericloew_NCAR>	Have you tried a complete Vx reboot with the red switch or a pod power cycle?
Mar 08 18:43:58 <sabl-C130>	i can not have a winds display to look at hgm232, i have to rely on others and they say it is ok.
Mar 08 18:45:54 <Bruce_M_Veracruz>	I thought there was a winds display on top of the rack.
Mar 08 18:49:31 <sabl-C130>	they have taken it away for other variavlese
Mar 08 18:57:06 <sabl-C130>	definately looks like we lost the amp or detector on the ir. will reserve final judgement until bruce looks at data. display is range corrected noise and only signal strong enough is the ground.
Mar 08 19:00:09 <ericloew_NCAR>	Mike, have you tried a hard reboot on the Vx system?
Mar 08 19:01:05 <ericloew_NCAR>	If the APD TE controller malfunctions, this can fix the problem.
Mar 08 19:02:54 <sabl-C130>	we are getting lat, long, alt in teh display window. radar alt is still stuck on 118. 
Mar 08 19:03:30 <ericloew_NCAR>	Another thing to try is increasing the APD bias voltage in 10V increments and see if the signal improves. The detector should avalanche (get real noisy) about 350V.
Mar 08 19:03:32 <sabl-C130>	i have power cycled and rebooted vx.
Mar 08 19:17:11 <sabl-C130>	have the apd gain up to 450v with no change in background noise
Mar 08 19:17:50 -->	bruce_ (Bruce@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) has joined &SABL
Mar 08 19:20:05 <--	Bruce_M_Veracruz has quit (Ping timeout)
Mar 08 19:20:28 <ericloew_NCAR>	Mike, Stop or you may destroy the APD! 
Mar 08 19:22:05 <sabl-C130>	have been back to default 275v for awhile.
Mar 08 19:24:38 ---	bruce_ is now known as Bruce_Veracurz
Mar 08 19:26:33 <ericloew_NCAR>	Mike, Bruce sounds like either the APD or the APD bias supply have gone bad. This can be verified using a DMM on the ground, but you'll have to pull the telescope and remove the receiver coverplate.
Mar 08 19:27:03 <sabl-C130>	i am way too hot in this seat. the ac and air circulation in this area is worthless. have already gone through 2 bottles of water.
Mar 08 19:28:50 <Bruce_Veracurz>	We will check out the IR reciever when we can - maybe late tomorrow if the seatainer can be unpacked quickly.
Mar 08 19:29:39 <sabl-C130>	as usual, we get some easy field time and now we have to pay the price.
Mar 08 19:30:34 <sabl-C130>	any other thoughts on the non reporting radar altimeter.
Mar 08 19:31:50 <sabl-C130>	janet s. was changing some code preflight today. possible that she changed something related? she might be in the ops center. she is scheduled to leave tomorrow.
Mar 08 19:32:48 <Bruce_Veracurz>	Have Dave A check to see that the radar alt is on and working.
Mar 08 19:33:32 <sabl-C130>	done that several times today
Mar 08 19:33:37 <Bruce_Veracurz>	Larry told me that it was on and working when he left the plane today.
Mar 08 19:33:55 <ericloew_NCAR>	As for the radar altimeter problem, could we have lost our network connection to the ADS system? Did it ever update during the flight? Is laser lockout enabled in the control window and radar altimeter selected?
Mar 08 19:34:32 <sabl-C130>	we need to insist that we get an ads window to monitor that and pitch.roll
Mar 08 19:34:59 <sabl-C130>	atleast until we get this solved
Mar 08 19:36:15 <Bruce_Veracurz>	We should be able to do that with easily with some saved settings.  
Mar 08 19:37:58 <sabl-C130>	the ferry was all set up., they changed it last, or this, flt.
Mar 08 19:41:03 <sabl-C130>	if i auto lockout enable it will shut laser down with ddatabase entry enabled
Mar 08 19:41:56 <sabl-C130>	only way i know to run is with autolockout disabled
Mar 08 19:42:42 <sabl-C130>	we are getting p-alt, lat, long in sabl display. is that same place we get radar alt info?
Mar 08 19:44:38 <Bruce_Veracurz>	With everything else going on, are the data disk lights blinking?
Mar 08 19:45:07 <sabl-C130>	we just lost latitude info on display window, -99.99, but was good before.
Mar 08 19:46:23 <sabl-C130>	i remembered to remember to start recording after each time i restarted vx/sabl control - which today has been many many many times
Mar 08 19:48:20 <Bruce_Veracurz>	That was my 'What time is the 10am take off?' question.
Mar 08 19:49:44 <sabl-C130>	ok, things are getting more wierd. i just tried to enable autolockout alt adn it is not working. latitude is still no go.
Mar 08 19:50:38 <Bruce_Veracurz>	I think eric must be at lunch - just like the sabl system.
Mar 08 19:50:50 <sabl-C130>	early in the flt i was constantly trying it and no good. now alt autodisable is good.
Mar 08 19:51:06 <ericloew_NCAR>	Mike, the radar altimeter WILL NOT update if auto lockout is disabled. Enable autolockout and see if altitude updates. 
Mar 08 19:52:12 <ericloew_NCAR>	Radar altimeter data comes directly from the ADS database; LAT, LONG, and ALT come from the arinc-429.
Mar 08 19:53:54 <sabl-C130>	yeah, i jiggled the network cables, etc. a half hour into the flt. many tries since then - no good. now ok.
Mar 08 19:56:12 <Bruce_Veracurz>	Does the IR still look bad.  Since you have been over the Pacific, I wouldn't expect much return signal.
Mar 08 19:58:28 <sabl-C130>	i have the green tuned up and am seeing  some nice stuff, apd is hosed - sorry to say.
Mar 08 19:59:12 <sabl-C130>	we might have gotten into the sun. it was around noon when we lost it.
Mar 08 19:59:23 <Bruce_Veracurz>	How were the power shifts today?
Mar 08 19:59:40 <sabl-C130>	i can just see the ground in ir
Mar 08 20:00:16 <Bruce_Veracurz>	If the sun got into the reciever when running, I will be able to see that on playback.
Mar 08 20:00:30 <sabl-C130>	got a short glimpse of a cloud return, just now
Mar 08 20:00:49 <Bruce_Veracurz>	It isn't completely dead then.
Mar 08 20:01:42 <Bruce_Veracurz>	Any big bumps during the flight?
Mar 08 20:02:13 <sabl-C130>	maybe, when it went out i was having to mess with restarting windows and had not gotten things working to a point to get recording started. maybe not.
Mar 08 20:02:49 <sabl-C130>	smooth flt today
Mar 08 20:03:28 <ericloew_NCAR>	Mike, sounds like you've done all the troubleshooting of the IR channel possible while in flight. I will be happy to assist in any way I can when you get back on the ground.
Mar 08 20:05:22 <sabl-C130>	i will be on the groud at 6pm. will you be at DIA and on a flt to veracruz by then?  n 
Mar 08 20:05:48 <sabl-C130>	quote "happy to assist in any way"
Mar 08 20:11:02 <sabl-C130>	bruce you jinxed me. we just got into the bl and are chopping up. 
Mar 08 20:11:08 <ericloew_NCAR>	If absolutely necessary, but I think I can probably provide adequate assistance from here.
Mar 08 20:12:38 <sabl-C130>	the green still works, we will just leave this ir problem until we get back to jeffco. : )
Mar 08 20:13:35 <Bruce_Veracurz>	Let's look at the data and see what we can tell then.
Mar 08 20:14:11 <Bruce_Veracurz>	Eric, we don't have any snow to shovel here.
Mar 08 20:14:28 <ericloew_NCAR>	The green is not nearly as sensitive as the IR (normally), so we (royal) should probably make every effort to fix it.
Mar 08 20:16:44 <sabl-C130>	they are planning flt fri and sun, after that we can probably have a day to get the telescope out.
Mar 08 20:17:47 <sabl-C130>	maybe sat will work too
Mar 08 20:19:34 <ericloew_NCAR>	Bruce, update me when you've looked at the data.
Mar 08 20:19:55 <Bruce_Veracurz>	If need be we can also fly the lead bricks rather than the telescope.
Mar 08 20:20:42 <Bruce_Veracurz>	I will try and look at the data tonight and email you so you have it when you get to work.
Mar 08 20:21:08 <Bruce_Veracurz>	That may give you a reason to be sick tomorrow.
Mar 08 20:23:30 <ericloew_NCAR>	Just one of many.
Mar 08 20:32:55 <Bruce_Veracurz>	Flying small circles in the syk?
Mar 08 20:36:04 <sabl-C130>	yes. finally time to get out of this seat for a few minutes while we spiral.
Mar 08 20:40:28 <Bruce_Veracurz>	Still hot?  Need a fan?
Mar 08 20:42:47 <sabl-C130>	extremely uncomfortable. fan might help. does blowing hot air on you make you feel better? not sure
Mar 08 20:44:28 <Bruce_Veracurz>	All the AC going to the pumps/equipment up front?
Mar 08 20:46:53 <sabl-C130>	we are in the dead zone between the forward cabin and the vents just behind us.
Mar 08 20:47:15 <ericloew_NCAR>	Bruce, what is the correct path to the data? /data_first/sabl-alpha/MIRAGE/TFXX?
Mar 08 20:48:15 <Bruce_Veracurz>	Do you want access to the data in data from the test flights in Boulder?
Mar 08 20:48:51 <Bruce_Veracurz>	In Boulder I think it is /scr/sci1/bruce/MIRAGE/....
Mar 08 20:49:53 <Bruce_Veracurz>	The path you gave I think is correct for the data disks from the C130
Mar 08 20:50:35 <ericloew_NCAR>	No. I want Mike to verify data appears on the C-130 disks. 
Mar 08 20:51:49 <Bruce_Veracurz>	I think the /data_first/sabl-alpha/MIRAGE is correct.
Mar 08 20:52:02 <sabl-C130>	what do you want me to do?
Mar 08 20:53:33 <ericloew_NCAR>	Mike, are you fairly certain that the SABL recording system is functioning normally?
Mar 08 20:54:12 <ericloew_NCAR>	Bruce, did you ever discover the missing data from FF01?
Mar 08 20:55:17 <Bruce_Veracurz>	It was not on the two data disks that I looked on.  I haven't looked on the system disk or any of the other data disks from the C130.
Mar 08 20:56:30 <sabl-C130>	with the addition of the safety stuff this system has gone back to being hard to get going after takeoff.
Mar 08 20:57:39 <sabl-C130>	today i had to cycle power on pod, reboot linux, etc to get things going. 
Mar 08 20:58:28 <ericloew_NCAR>	Patience after takeoff is the key. The system won't do anything until aircraft roll/pitch are withing +/-5 deg.
Mar 08 20:58:49 <sabl-C130>	then i still had to mess with the non-reporting radar alt.  long story is i think i might started recording on ferry then lost my windows and forgot to restart recording.
Mar 08 21:00:42 <sabl-C130>	it has nothing to do with patience. ok, sometimes - but this is different. jonathan is having similar problems last flt.
Mar 08 21:02:42 <sabl-C130>	main prob is with everything as it should be it will not digitizer. something is holding off digitizer.
Mar 08 21:02:58 <sabl-C130>	real bumpy now.
Mar 08 21:06:04 <sabl-C130>	i think it is related to radar alt not avail. using iru_...mode 0 after takeoff got it working. i tried all combos of alt safety and could not get it working.
Mar 08 21:11:06 <ericloew_NCAR>	Mike, I don't understand. If you use iru_...mode 0, you are disabling pitch and roll safety shutoffs.
Mar 08 21:12:27 <ericloew_NCAR>	Even in up-looking mode, the laser will should still shutoff if pitch/roll exceeds +/-5 deg. This protects nearby aircraft.

Mar 10 16:26:36 <Bruce_Veracruz>	Jonathan, how are you doing?
Mar 10 16:32:09 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	teresa on the c130 channel wants a reading from the fromt panel of her CO, send info via xchat
Mar 10 16:36:23 <sabl-C130>	Just got back to my seat, they needed to get to the laptop on top of the rack.
Mar 10 16:38:20 <sabl-C130>	The ads data system network hub got unplugged and I ran the system in the iru_set_safety_mode 1 for a while.  The ads system is back up and I am using the iru_set_safety_mode 0.  Everything seems happy at the moment.  Still no ir.
Mar 10 16:40:27 <Bruce_Veracruz>	If you can get IR working you are a true wizzard!
Mar 10 16:41:29 <Bruce_Veracruz>	See any layers?

Mar 10 16:59:28 <sabl-C130>	Well, that was wierd, the 1u computer froze.  Had to hit the power switch.
Mar 10 17:01:21 <Bruce_Veracruz>	was it not able to refresh tthe sabl control window after moving between quadrants? that is what happened last flt.
Mar 10 17:02:33 <sabl-C130>	Yes, no command would work.
Mar 10 17:12:51 <Bruce_Veracruz>	if the window can not refresh in less than 30 seconds it probably is hung. later in last flt there were some slow refreshes, 10-15 seconds.
Mar 10 17:15:41 <Bruce_Veracruz>	was startup a little easier today?
Mar 10 17:16:36 <sabl-C130>	It was about 1 1/2 minutes, game over, please restart.
Mar 10 17:16:51 <sabl-C130>	Startup of the whole system?
Mar 10 17:21:54 <Bruce_Veracruz>	did the system let you get the digitizer going right from the start? how long did you wait to try to start, or did you just wait until rad alt and p/r came into good ranges.
Mar 10 17:27:03 <sabl-C130>	The system started right away because I had to bypass the safety system because of the ads network problem.  Nobody in the plane was getting any info.  We almost came home.  Bill got it working again.
Mar 10 17:27:57 <Bruce_Veracruz>	ok
Mar 10 17:28:28 <sabl-C130>	After the ads network was up, I put the safety back in the system and it came right up.
Mar 10 17:30:27 <Bruce_Veracruz>	is the cabin starting to heat up
Mar 10 17:35:17 <sabl-C130>	starting? how do we get the hottest seat? It is about the same, maybe a liitle hotter than the first flight.
Mar 10 17:37:33 <Bruce_Veracruz>	only 6 more hours!
Mar 10 17:47:58 <ericloew>	Hey, at least it's not snowing; it took me almost an hour to get to work today!
Mar 10 17:49:37 <Bruce_Veracruz>	how much snow did you get. heard most of it has already melted
Mar 10 17:55:46 <ericloew>	Boulder has about 3". It's still on the grass. The roads are just slick.

Mar 10 19:10:29 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	eric, we have not been in the spares yet. jonathan has the pack list on the c130. maybe he can look at the list for the air shipments.
Mar 10 19:21:36 <sabl-C130>	what are you looking for?
Mar 10 19:37:12 <ericloew>	Jonathan, I am looking for a spare APD High Voltage supply made by Analog Modules. I suspect that is the problem with the IR channel.

Mar 10 20:16:20 <Bruce_Veracruz>	Do you see something that says 'Remote Display' or something like that?
Mar 10 20:16:24 <sabl-C130>	Any body out there?
Mar 10 20:17:11 <sabl-C130>	In which computer?
Mar 10 20:17:37 <Bruce_Veracruz>	You need to know the name of Frank's display.
Mar 10 20:18:06 <Bruce_Veracruz>	Did you swap system disks?
Mar 10 20:18:24 <sabl-C130>	It is working now, it just better by the hour!
Mar 10 20:19:13 <Bruce_Veracruz>	How HOT is it?  Only 3 more hours!
Mar 10 20:20:46 <Bruce_Veracruz>	Frank has a display now?
Mar 10 20:21:18 <sabl-C130>	No, I don't know what was the problem, the software, hardware, so I just switched the whole thing.  We needed to know where to fly then, not later.
Mar 10 20:22:05 <Bruce_Veracruz>	Look on the SABL control panel - is there a remote display field?
Mar 10 20:22:07 <sabl-C130>	We are going up to 16500 to try to cool down.
Mar 10 20:22:07 <sabl-C130>	Frank has display now.
Mar 10 20:23:08 <sabl-C130>	I also did not switch the data drives.
Mar 10 20:23:17 <sabl-C130>	Sweat is dripping off me, it is HOT and so is the system.
Mar 10 20:24:45 <sabl-C130>	"remote display field" is this in a folder or just in a window?
Mar 10 20:25:43 <Bruce_Veracruz>	Frank has  a display.  We will find it tomorrow.  Go cool off on the ramp!
Mar 10 20:26:45 <sabl-C130>	are we there yet?

Mar 12 23:34:37 <Bruce_Veracruz>	That is quite close to the limit!
Mar 12 23:34:56 <sabl-C130>	limit is 55C. 
Mar 12 23:35:41 <sabl-C130>	temp was climbing about 1 degree in 2 minutes
Mar 12 23:35:57 <sabl-C130>	and not showing signs of slowing down
Mar 12 23:37:24 <sabl-C130>	i think the best thing they are gettting now is that the model has fallen apart. we are going all over the place and can not find a plume.
Mar 12 23:40:45 <Bruce_Veracruz>	Models don't do well with light winds.
Mar 12 23:41:24 <sabl-C130>	i am thinking of putting the eldora TX fan in the back of this rack and blow aft past the UPS to the operators legs. that might get some cooler air from the front cabin to the seat area.

Mar 13 00:41:11 <sabl-C130>	second best news today
Mar 13 00:43:32 <sabl-C130>	now that all is cooling down for the day i am seeing some variation in teh green noise 
Mar 13 00:43:59 <sabl-C130>	we were running so hot today it was never an issue until now
Mar 13 00:51:02 <sabl-C130>	something else to pass along to charlie martin is that some of the slowness in screen refreshes between quadrants is during the times you have a warning (digitizer or laser controller) window. the warning seems to come up first and slows the refresh/redraw when entering a window. if he could put a lower priority on the warning window, let the normal windows redraw first it might help with the occasional lockup. 
Mar 13 00:58:27 <sabl_ops>	Jonathan is on his way.  The laser temperatures are changing so laser power must also be changing and I think that gives us the bands in the data.

Mar 16 18:44:15 <sabl-C130>	Are you guys making progress on the board?
Mar 16 18:46:49 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	We replaced the socket and capacitor, and now are able to go up 400 V with the APD in the socket.
Mar 16 18:47:19 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	There must have been a problem with either the capacitor or the socket.
Mar 16 18:48:37 <sabl-C130>	So what is the plan now?
Mar 16 18:49:43 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	I guess we put it in the system.
Mar 16 18:49:53 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Where are the screws that hold the APD ?
Mar 16 18:50:06 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	...hold the APD to the plate ?
Mar 16 18:50:28 <sabl-C130>	When?
Mar 16 18:51:00 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	I'm not sure - can you ask them to turn the plane around :-)
Mar 16 18:51:22 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Do you know where the screw are ?
Mar 16 18:51:44 <sabl-C130>	They are in a plastic bag, maybe in the box with the soldering iron or in the tool bag.
Mar 16 18:52:44 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Mike's got them. Thanks.
Mar 16 18:53:46 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	I guess we'll have to try the board out tomorrow.
Mar 16 18:54:20 <sabl-C130>	So, does that mean tomorrow we put it in the system?
Mar 16 18:55:16 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	It looks like it may be the only opportunity.
Mar 16 19:03:25 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	mike here, we have done all we can with the apd. no fly tomorrow and we will try to install and align starting at 0800
Mar 16 19:04:15 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	we have full HV control, only replaced the cap and apd. must have been one or the other that went.
Mar 16 19:07:32 <sabl-C130>	That good news that it is working again, at least on the "bench."  Is that the offical OPS plan, no fly day, tomorrow?
Mar 16 19:08:57 <sabl-C130>	95 degrees and bumpy
Mar 16 19:13:31 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	we are overhearing talk of flts on sat and sun, harddown mon.
Mar 16 19:14:30 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	laura will be on the sunday flt if it goes. i have asked al schanot for another seat for you to train her.
Mar 16 19:14:50 <sabl-C130>	That sucks
Mar 16 19:15:19 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	you thought this would be it for you. ha ha.
Mar 16 19:16:30 <sabl-C130>	Teresa is also trying to get on the plane.  Her stuff is not working, again.
Mar 16 19:17:00 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	we probably will not get the seat. i am willing to turn her loose alone. she has had no flt experience, but some in hangar. will have to get her through on xchat
Mar 16 19:17:29 <sabl-C130>	Laura gets thrown in the fire.
Mar 16 19:17:55 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	got to pop that thing sometime.
Mar 16 19:18:59 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	how long is today flt?
Mar 16 19:19:15 <sabl-C130>	Xchat it is/will be.
Mar 16 19:20:00 <sabl-C130>	I think it is 8 hours.
Mar 16 19:21:34 <sabl-C130>	According to the flight sheet, we "should" be back at 5:34pm local.
Mar 16 19:23:01 <sabl-C130>	Only 4+ hours to go!!

Mar 16 20:50:21 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	did you save the cap taken off the pc board yesterday? eric wants to know.
Mar 16 20:53:34 <sabl-C130>	It was on the piece of paper on the "bench" yesterday.  I you did not save it, I didn't.  It would have gotten thrown away.
Mar 16 20:55:05 <sabl-C130>	Just under 100 degrees and still bumpy.  I don't think the fan is doing anything.  We need to push a lot more air.
Mar 16 20:57:33 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	not good news. maybe the bigger fan will help;
Mar 16 20:57:59 <sabl-C130>	You need to go back to the SABL channel!!
Mar 16 21:06:10 <sabl-C130>	Are we there yet?

Mar 16 23:20:45 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	is the refresh when changing quadrants causing the lockup
Mar 16 23:22:35 <sabl-C130>	Not always.
Mar 16 23:24:28 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	so sometimes you go to use mouse/keyboard and you get nothing.

Mar 16 23:28:10 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	those pc boxes need to be replaced. sooner the better.
Mar 16 23:32:19 <sabl-C130>	The last time, we where in a long climb.  At the top, I tried to hit the acknowledge icon, in the same quadrant, and the computer was locked.

Mar 18 15:24:11 <Bruce_Boulder>	Who is flying today?
Mar 18 15:25:12 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Hi, Bruce
Mar 18 15:25:19 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Mike is flying today.
Mar 18 15:25:42 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	This is Gordon (in the ops center)
Mar 18 15:26:21 <Bruce_Boulder>	Good work on the IR channel!
Mar 18 15:27:25 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Thanks - Jonathon and Mike did a great job changing out the detector board yesterday.
Mar 18 15:29:02 <sabl-C130>	oh the joy. it is 90 and i have a fan blowing hot air on me
Mar 18 15:29:44 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Mike, just wait until it is 95 and you have a fan blowing hot air on you !
Mar 18 15:31:35 <sabl-C130>	as eric says, have patience
Mar 18 15:31:53 <Bruce_Boulder>	I won't tell you what the temp in Boulder is.
Mar 18 15:32:20 <Bruce_Boulder>	How long did it take to position the detector?
Mar 18 15:32:55 <sabl-C130>	probably close to the same as at 17000 ft here
Mar 18 15:33:50 <Bruce_Boulder>	The snow in my backyard isn't melting.
Mar 18 15:35:53 <sabl-C130>	we marked position of apd box before removing. putting it back on marks brought up the signal on the oscope to an accecptable level. 
Mar 18 15:39:53 <Bruce_Boulder>	Good!  It will be interesting to see if the green is still used or if Frank switches back to the IR.
Mar 18 15:40:38 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Mike, how does the IR look today ?
Mar 18 15:42:05 <sabl-C130>	ir has more sensitivity than green. looks ok
Mar 18 15:43:32 <sabl-C130>	playing with the display scaling the green might have a bit more than the ir.
Mar 18 15:47:27 <Bruce_Boulder>	What is the APD high voltage set at?
Mar 18 15:52:36 <sabl-C130>	same as before, 275
Mar 18 15:53:45 <Bruce_Boulder>	If we are using a different APD the voltage may need to be adjusted.
Mar 18 16:00:50 <sabl-C130>	it is working well enough to leave it alone
Mar 18 16:02:03 <Bruce_Boulder>	OK.  We can look at it on a no fly day.
Mar 18 16:04:04 <sabl-C130>	or we can look at it in boulder
Mar 18 16:05:38 <Bruce_Boulder>	Let's look at the data post flight and go from there.

Mar 18 16:15:42 <sabl-C130>	we are at 17500 ft and it is 90
Mar 18 16:18:59 <Bruce_Boulder>	Does the fan help?
Mar 18 16:19:23 <Bruce_Boulder>	Back in an hour or so - home projects to catch up on.
Mar 18 16:20:35 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Bruce, do you know when Laura is arriving?
Mar 18 16:21:50 <Bruce_Boulder>	No, I don't know her travel schedule.
Mar 18 16:22:12 <sabl-C130>	if the fan was moving more air it probably help. i can feel it, effects seem minimal.
Mar 18 16:24:13 <Bruce_Boulder>	Later
Mar 18 16:38:54 <sabl-C130>	only 6 more hours!!
Mar 18 16:39:44 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	6, short, sweet hours.
Mar 18 16:41:18 <sabl-C130>	any luck getting info from boulder travel re: laura
Mar 18 16:46:49 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	no, we found a "for emergency only" number. 
Mar 18 17:01:46 <sabl-C130>	just discovered why fan might not be working. apol put a big suitcase in back of our rack, up against our fan. i will be sure to thank them.
Mar 18 17:25:00 <Bruce_Boulder>	Gordon, anyone I can contact in Boulder about Laura's travel?
Mar 18 17:26:34 <--	sabl-C130 has quit (Ping timeout)
Mar 18 17:29:32 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Jonathan here, Shelley Zucker would know.  Home # 303-516-0638, cell 303-817-7793.
Mar 18 17:32:59 <Bruce_Boulder>	I will give her a call and see if I can get a time.

Mar 18 17:35:08 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Thanks, my skpy phone sort of works from the room, sometimes with the lack of bandwidth.
Mar 18 17:48:29 <Bruce_Boulder>	I left a message with Shelley.  I'll let you know when I hear from her.
Mar 18 18:10:48 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Bruce, can you call Brigitte??  Home 303-449-2038 & cell 303-579-1601.
Mar 18 18:18:19 <Bruce_Boulder>	Do you want me to ask Brigette about Laura's travel plans?
Mar 18 18:20:16 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Yes, please. 
Mar 18 18:34:01 <Bruce_Boulder>	Shelley thinks she is on the Continental Flight at 11:15?
Mar 18 18:34:52 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	11:15pm !!  She thinks or knows?
Mar 18 18:38:24 <Bruce_Boulder>	Thinks.  Shelley thinks Laure took the easier path through Houston.  She is not near work now so she can't check to be sure.
Mar 18 18:38:47 <sabl-C130>	jonathan, better be ready to fly tomorrow if laura gets in at 11:15
Mar 18 18:39:08 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	That's what I was afraid of.
Mar 18 18:39:09 <Bruce_Boulder>	Are they flying Sunday?
Mar 18 18:39:16 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Yes, Bruce.
Mar 18 18:41:24 <Bruce_Boulder>	Back to back is hard for people who don't have multiple instrument operators.
Mar 18 18:45:41 <sabl-C130>	they wanted to fly on monday but the pilots are traveling to switch on monday. so, sunday. monday harddowm
Mar 18 18:47:32 <Bruce_Boulder>	Hard to fly without pilots.

Mar 18 19:58:31 <sabl-C130>	there have been issues with the data link from the plane. the bandwidth is choking off for the ion info to jeffco.
Mar 18 20:00:41 <Bruce_Boulder>	Too bad.  Where are you now?
Mar 18 20:00:45 <sabl-C130>	they were suspecting someone on last few flts was down/up loading files or surfing web. everyone claims innocence.
Mar 18 20:06:26 <sabl-C130>	with any luck we will be landing in amsterdam in another 4 hours.
Mar 18 20:08:00 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	sounds like a good place.
Mar 18 20:09:35 <sabl-C130>	it might be a little chilly for short pants, though.
Mar 18 20:11:39 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	I'm sure you could figure something out.
Mar 18 20:11:51 <sabl-C130>	did someone go to check the 2:30 flt . see if laura gets off.
Mar 18 20:15:53 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	There is not a 2:30 flight on Saturday.  Continental arrival is 11:14pm for all flights to Veracruz today.
Mar 18 20:16:41 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	The only American flight arrives at Veracruz at 9:10pm tonight.
Mar 18 20:20:37 <sabl-C130>	if al schanot is at the ops ctr as him to get alfonso at asur. he probably knows someone at mexicani air that could get into the computer and find her.
Mar 18 20:26:30 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	We are not going to be able to get that info that way.  We are working on it.
Mar 18 20:30:11 <Bruce_Boulder>	Shelley says Brigette would not know Laura's flight plans.  Brigitte doesn't do travel plans - Shelley does.
Mar 18 20:32:16 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Bruce: is there any way that Shelley can confirm Laura's flight for us. We think that it will either be the 9:10 AA or the 11:14 Continental. It would really help us.
Mar 18 20:33:46 <Bruce_Boulder>	I will ask if she can stop at work and look it up.  She wasn't near FL earlier in the day.
Mar 18 20:34:16 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Can she log into her email wia the web ? THat way she doesn't need to make a trip to FL.
Mar 18 20:34:55 <Bruce_Boulder>	I don't think she was at home.  I got her on her cell phone.
Mar 18 20:35:12 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Could she use webmail for example ?
Mar 18 20:35:43 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Do you know if she is at home now ?
Mar 18 20:39:27 <Bruce_Boulder>	No, I don't.  It didn't sound like she was going to back until later this afternoon.  I will check.
Mar 18 20:40:49 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Thanks very much, Bruce. You are doing a great job over there for us.
Mar 18 21:33:53 <Bruce_Boulder>	Shelley will check when she gets home - half an hour to an hour.
Mar 18 21:41:49 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	OK, thanks bruce.

Mar 18 22:41:14 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	I'll be trying out my driving skills in Veracruz this evening
Mar 18 22:41:50 <Bruce_Boulder>	Good luck on a Saturday night!
Mar 18 22:42:20 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	It is going to be exciting

Mar 18 22:53:53 <sabl-C130>	anyone there, have been disconnected for over an hour
Mar 18 22:54:09 <sabl-C130>	who is this
Mar 18 22:54:23 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	This is Gordon
Mar 18 22:54:31 <Bruce_Boulder>	Hi Mike - Bruce here
Mar 18 22:54:36 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Jonathon has gone to pick you up
Mar 18 22:55:26 <sabl-C130>	ok, laura will not have to fly on sunday?
Mar 18 22:56:55 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	We could try to get both Jonathon and Laura onto the flight if Laura is up to it. The take-off time is 11:15 so she wouldn't have to wake up that early.
Mar 18 22:58:34 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Mike: did you get this message -- Mike: Laura is coming in at 11:15. I'll pick her up from the airport.
Mar 18 22:58:34 <sabl-C130>	eta is now 23:30
Mar 18 22:59:18 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	You are ending up with an 8 hour flight
Mar 18 23:01:42 <sabl-C130>	we still do not know if we will have a second seat. we probably should plan for jonathan to fly and if we get a second seat for laura to go also.
Mar 18 23:02:40 <sabl-C130>	that way we do not have to get to airport until 10:00. that is leaving hotel at 9:30. she will have a problem with a meal and drinks for the flt
Mar 18 23:02:54 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Jonathon is under the impression that he is flying tomorrow - he didn't think that it was an option.
Mar 18 23:03:26 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	What time do the shops open on Sunday ? Are they open at all ?
Mar 18 23:08:05 <Bruce_Boulder>	I think the MEGA is open on Sunday but I don't know what time it opens.
Mar 18 23:08:34 <sabl-C130>	my opinion is to have laura not fly tomorrow. she can probably go with us to airport to see jonathan off.
Mar 18 23:10:40 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	okay
Mar 18 23:16:28 <sabl-C130>	ok what?
Mar 18 23:17:17 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	ok, I agree - we won't ask for the extra seat on the flight tomorrow
Mar 18 23:18:43 <sabl-C130>	alright, i will let frank know. also tell al S. that jonathan, not laura, is on tomorrow
Mar 18 23:19:25 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	he isn't here right now - he may have gone to the airport, but I let him know when I see him
Mar 18 23:22:02 <sabl-C130>	i will see al S when we arrive

Mar 19 17:40:56 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Laura arrived last night. She, Jonathon, and Mike have gone to the airport.
Mar 19 17:41:17 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	I have posted yesterday's images to the catalog.
Mar 19 17:44:59 <Bruce_Boulder>	I just looked at them. You are fast.  Nice to have the IR back.
Mar 19 17:46:11 <Bruce_Boulder>	Jonathan flying today?
Mar 19 17:47:24 -->	sabl-C130 (sabl@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) has joined &SABL
Mar 19 17:50:44 <--	sabl-C130 has quit (Ping timeout)
Mar 19 17:51:53 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	The IR data looks good.
Mar 19 17:52:25 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Yes, Jonathon is flying today. This will be his last flight of the experiment.
Mar 19 17:53:08 -->	sabl-C130 (sabl@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) has joined &SABL
Mar 19 17:53:37 <Bruce_Boulder>	Who has the next flight?
Mar 19 17:54:00 <Bruce_Boulder>	Hi Jonathan.  Snowing here in Boulder.
Mar 19 17:56:44 <sabl-C130>	Snowing!!  Thanks, that is just what I wanted to hear.  It only 96 degrees in the plane.
Mar 19 17:57:29 <Bruce_Boulder>	Did you install the new fans?
Mar 19 17:58:39 <sabl-C130>	Thanks for the help yesterday.  You are our only support back in Boulder.
Mar 19 17:59:41 <sabl-C130>	We had no time to install fans.  Have to suffer one more flight, maybe two.
Mar 19 17:59:58 <sabl-C130>	How was getting home?  Mexico City, any problems with the visa/forms?
Mar 19 18:00:59 <Bruce_Boulder>	No problem.  The Mexico city airport isn't fun.
Mar 19 18:01:25 <Bruce_Boulder>	I picked up my exit visa form at the Veracruz ticket counter.  Just ask for it.
Mar 19 18:02:15 <Bruce_Boulder>	I recieved all my boarding passes in Veracruz.  Larry didn't and as a result he missed a connection in Mexico City and flew standby back to DIA.
Mar 19 18:03:26 <sabl-C130>	Seeing some "banding" in the green.  We are at FL164 and cooling is cycling.
Mar 19 18:04:44 <Bruce_Boulder>	The next sabl mod - cooling!
Mar 19 18:05:00 <sabl-C130>	I will make sure I get all of my boarding in Veracruz with the right name on it.
Mar 19 18:08:11 <Bruce_Boulder>	In Mexico city you go back through gate 19? to the international terminal.  The exit immegration booth is in the new area of the terminal - a bit of a walk from gate 19.
Mar 19 18:08:33 <sabl-C130>	"This is the last project of SABL," so we don't need to worry about it.  Last one right after the next one!!!
Mar 19 18:09:34 <Bruce_Boulder>	It is a small booth in a large hall with many duty free shops and a starbucks.
Mar 19 18:13:06 <Bruce_Boulder>	Be sure to get you exit immegration form from at the ticket counter also.
Mar 19 18:14:30 <sabl-C130>	The ticket counter in Veracruz?
Mar 19 18:17:55 <Bruce_Boulder>	Yes, in Veracruz
Mar 19 18:19:23 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	mike here, already at 96. never got over 90 yesterday
Mar 19 18:27:07 <sabl-C130>	Altitude lockout not tracking anymore,  it was working for a while.  When we came down from alt it did not track and is stuck at 1502m.
Mar 19 18:30:28 <sabl-C130>	HGM232 is working on the laptop in front of me.
Mar 19 18:32:52 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Jonathon: Gordon here, Mike has gone. Not sure what HGM232 is.
Mar 19 18:33:48 <sabl-C130>	Radar alt
Mar 19 18:34:34 <Bruce_Boulder>	Which comm line does the that information (radar altimeter) use?
Mar 19 18:35:44 <sabl-C130>	Getting hot, flying at 1000ft agl
Mar 19 18:36:24 <Bruce_Boulder>	SABL working looking up?
Mar 19 18:36:50 <sabl-C130>	It is in Eric's email that he sent a eek or two ago.
Mar 19 18:37:41 <sabl-C130>	I am getting the roll cutoff, but not the pitch.
Mar 19 18:39:31 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Jonathon, Laura here.  Is any data recording or is the laser locked out?
Mar 19 18:43:25 <sabl-C130>	Yes, SABL works looking up.  Lasing and recording.
Mar 19 18:43:46 <Bruce_Boulder>	Pitch, roll, lat, long, alt are arinc29 data via twinax to the vx works in the pod.  HGM232 is from the ADS data base via the network to the 1U computer.  Check the network connection if you haven't already.
Mar 19 18:45:49 <Bruce_Boulder>	Radar altimiter status will update only if auto lockout enabled.  (Thankyou Eric!)
Mar 19 18:47:18 <sabl-C130>	Also, wierd Horz waves int IR channel above boundry layer.  Steps of arounf 100m meters, light, dark.  Not real bad, but not right.
Mar 19 18:48:23 <sabl-C130>	Bruce, really?  Learn something new everyday!
Mar 19 18:48:47 <sabl-C130>	Climbing and the horz waves in IR are going away.
Mar 19 18:49:11 <sabl-C130>	These waves are not natural.
Mar 19 18:51:29 <sabl-C130>	Pod is at 45.6 C, might have to turn off soon.
Mar 19 18:52:12 <Bruce_Boulder>	What is max pod temp - 55c?
Mar 19 18:54:31 <sabl-C130>	Max is 55c ,but it was going up 1 degree min.  We are climbing now and temp is going down.
Mar 19 19:03:56 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Laura here again, did you get the altitude lockout tracking again?  How?
Mar 19 19:06:30 <sabl-C130>	Is this the exact same problem that Mike had?
Mar 19 19:07:00 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	I have no idea, I just got here remember.  .  .
Mar 19 19:07:09 <sabl-C130>	Larua, the SABL system is not tracking.  We have"Jonathan Tracking"
Mar 19 19:07:25 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Please define.
Mar 19 19:08:41 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Are you tracking manually through the command window?
Mar 19 19:09:10 <sabl-C130>	Where is Mike?
Mar 19 19:09:35 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	In the pub most likely (just kidding, don't know)  Should I try to find him?
Mar 19 19:13:03 <sabl-C130>	I don't think you need to find him because he ever got it to work, is that right (Bruce).
Mar 19 19:16:14 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Is this altitude lockout tracking problem something we should consult Eric and or Larry about?
Mar 19 19:16:29 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Charlie, not Larry.
Mar 19 19:19:22 <sabl-C130>	I'm am not sure.  I would like to try to restart things, just haven't gotten the time.  Just ended flying w/ DC8
Mar 19 19:25:16 <sabl-C130>	I will try hitting the kill button and bringing windows again to try to fix it, when I get a chance.  SABL is very needed right now.
Mar 19 19:42:28 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	mike here, are you using the alt disabled now or manual input
Mar 19 19:46:04 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	the radar alt comes in on the blue network cable in the back. you could unplug momentarily. see if that works.
Mar 19 19:47:14 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	next thing to try is to restart sabl control window.
Mar 19 19:48:41 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	next to try is to stop linux session and restart without reboot of linux pc. 
Mar 19 19:48:53 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	last resort is to reboot linux pc.
Mar 19 19:49:28 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	the problem is the network feed into the pc/software connection.
Mar 19 19:50:30 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	you can always run with the alt auto cutoff disabled. just have to watch alt if looking down.
Mar 19 19:50:43 <Bruce_Boulder>	Check network cable at both ends if possible.  Problem could be at other end of cable - not sabl-linux pc.
Mar 19 19:52:25 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	the other end of the blue cable is overhead in big rack above aisle. it is on a small plate on the forward side of that big frame.
Mar 19 19:55:12 <sabl-C130>	Thanks, when we get a chance, I will try.  The suitcase that was in front of the fan might have hit something of ours.
Mar 19 19:56:31 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	what is your mode now. how are you cheating system
Mar 19 19:58:06 <sabl-C130>	I am looking down.  The system is cheating itself because it is stuck at 1502 m.
Mar 19 19:59:20 <sabl-C130>	The pitch roll still works and we have been looking down, I been watching a close eye of HGM232 to shut off if need be.
Mar 19 19:59:37 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	it should not allow ops at 1502m when looking down. 
Mar 19 19:59:54 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	the cutoff is 1800m when looking down
Mar 19 20:00:29 <sabl-C130>	Sorry, 5201m
Mar 19 20:01:08 <sabl-C130>	Brain scamble.
Mar 19 20:02:15 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	ok, when you get to a place in the flt to start working on problem do what i recommended
Mar 19 20:02:19 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	good luck
Mar 19 20:03:21 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	you should be able to remove/replace the blue network cable now without any bad effects.
Mar 19 20:04:46 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	having raf tech request a reset of radar alt in cockpit could do that now.
Mar 19 20:05:21 <sabl-C130>	Got it working again.
Mar 19 20:05:58 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	did you do anything
Mar 19 20:08:44 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	hello, i want to leave, please 
Mar 19 20:10:32 <sabl-C130>	OK, I resetted the blue cat 5 cable in the back of the PC, didn't work.  
Mar 19 20:11:56 <sabl-C130>	I killed the control window and opened a new one, thwas  anything.at worked.  Frank needed SABL on up until now so I was unable / not willing to try
Mar 19 20:13:27 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	the control panel restarting was what fixed it
Mar 19 20:13:33 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	?
Mar 19 20:14:36 <sabl-C130>	Yes, the SABL Control window.
Mar 19 20:15:15 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	bye bye for now, good luck
Mar 19 20:16:36 <Bruce_Boulder>	Still here at home sorting papers and watching chat.  Good work.
Mar 19 20:16:56 <Bruce_Boulder>	Get some 'cool' ramp time when possible.  What is your temp?
Mar 19 20:17:26 <sabl-C130>	That is the only window that I killed.  I did not select the "bomb" icon.
Mar 19 20:17:51 <Bruce_Boulder>	Google earth tracking you again.
Mar 19 20:20:11 <sabl-C130>	We have been at FL160 for 15/20 min.  It is about 94, the cool part of the flight, ahh!!
Mar 19 20:36:54 <Bruce_Boulder>	The ultimate question - where are you going tonight to eat?  Is it you last night in Veracruz?
Mar 19 20:41:50 <sabl-C130>	"I don't know, what sounds good to you?"  I think Gordon has a place picked out.
Mar 19 21:00:44 <Bruce_Boulder>	Did you drink any green beer on St. Pat's day?
Mar 19 21:02:49 <sabl-C130>	No, but the hotel had a party for us.  The green beer will have to wait.
Mar 19 21:03:48 <Bruce_Boulder>	Green beer is over rated - Guiness is better
Mar 19 21:06:03 <sabl-C130>	Agree!!
Mar 19 21:07:10 <sabl-C130>	But, green eggs and ham, winning combo, ah ah!
Mar 19 21:08:35 <Bruce_Boulder>	No comment on green food that shouldn't be green.
Mar 19 21:08:47 <Bruce_Boulder>	Off to buy my mother a birthday card. Later.
Mar 19 21:09:33 <sabl-C130>	Later!

Mar 19 22:08:08 <sabl-C130>	I am good.  It is the coolest flight that I have had.  Go to the Mega yet?
Mar 19 22:08:20 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	From the googlemap it looks like you guys almost caught some fish.
Mar 19 22:08:58 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	No, waiting for Mike to get back.  Do you have some stuff you want us to get?
Mar 19 22:11:14 <sabl-C130>	Fish and oil.  We saw some drilling rigs.
Mar 19 22:11:25 <sabl-C130>	What's Mike up to?  I don't need anything at the Mega, thanks.
Mar 19 22:11:38 <sabl-C130>	Get to the pool yet?
Mar 19 22:12:30 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Mike and Lorraine went to the artists' market and will be back at 4:30.  We've been in the Ops Center so as not to abandon you.
Mar 19 22:17:01 <sabl-C130>	Artists' market, sounds vancy.  
Mar 19 22:18:05 <sabl-C130>	Only 4 hours left!  
Mar 19 22:21:21 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	So is the ETR now 8:30pm local?
Mar 19 22:24:28 <sabl-C130>	The flight plan says 8:04pm local, if believe that.
Mar 19 22:37:15 <sabl-C130>	To soon to say for sure, but we are 20min behind right now.  It will probably be 9 hours, just my guess.
Mar 19 22:41:18 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Copy that.  Hang in there.
Mar 19 22:54:29 <sabl-C130>	35mins behind now.
Mar 19 23:01:20 ---	sabl-ops-veracruz is now known as mikestrong-ops-veracruz
Mar 19 23:02:41 <mikestrong-ops-veracruz>	back from the tourist shopping. the outdoor market in town center, mostly closed the day we went by on the way to fort.
Mar 19 23:03:15 ---	mikestrong-ops-veracruz is now known as mstrong-ops-veracruz
Mar 19 23:03:58 <sabl-C130>	Find any good tourist items?
Mar 19 23:06:59 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	lorraine bought a beach bag. nothing for me.
Mar 19 23:08:10 <sabl-C130>	No tourist junk?  Maybe next time.
Mar 19 23:08:40 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	there are some nice plazas and places to walk in that part of town. went into the church, nothing special. mostly rundown and needing repairs.
Mar 19 23:10:08 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	its going to be a late dinner tonight. hope they find some good stuff to make it worth it.
Mar 19 23:11:19 <sabl-C130>	It has been boring the last 30min, there was nothing at all.
Mar 19 23:12:21 <sabl-C130>	Getting into something, if you want to call it that, now.
Mar 19 23:12:26 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	are you sure the radar alt quit working, or were you faked out while you were flying at 5201 for a long time. looking at the flt profile you were about that alt for a long time.
Mar 19 23:18:09 <sabl-C130>	Radar alt on was not updating in SABL control.  It stayed at 5201m for more than a hour.  We where at 500m or so 1000ft agl with DC8.
Mar 19 23:19:44 <sabl-C130>	OK Eric, just kidding.  I know it wasn't working.
Mar 19 23:20:15 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	i believe you, but the flt track on flt RF07 shows you at about 5200m for 2 hours. starting at 1800Z, 1200local
Mar 19 23:21:00 <sabl-C130>	We have been at high alt a lot today.  It has been the coolest flight that I have been on.  It is 88 or so right now.
Mar 19 23:21:37 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	so, maybe what they use to plot the flt data on the mirage web site is getting the same error.
Mar 19 23:22:00 <sabl-C130>	They have had problems, I think with the flt track today, surprise.
Mar 19 23:24:06 <sabl-C130>	Maybe, I asked Ta about the radar alt and he assured me that it was working properly.  I saw the HGM232 updating on the laptop in front of me.
Mar 19 23:31:04 <sabl-C130>	We have flipped up and down many times today.  Ijust flipped down and there was nothing, not even the ground.  Stopped the system and restarted, it came back.
Mar 19 23:32:38 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	that restart happened once on last flt, no laser action. restarting STOP/RUN got it going
Mar 19 23:33:38 <sabl-C130>	VX lost comms today, just once.  It came back fine.
Mar 19 23:33:58 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	just talked to al S about hgm232. the internet feed with all flt info is different than ads and serial feeds.
Mar 19 23:35:00 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	he wants xchat notice next time it gets stuck. it might be something in their software.
Mar 19 23:36:15 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	also Ta did something funky today and they were messed up for a while
Mar 19 23:36:16 <sabl-C130>	OK, it has worked just fine since this morning.  Is this what happened to you on your flight?
Mar 19 23:37:22 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	yes, i did not get updates after takeoff. it was stuck at 181m for about an hour.
Mar 19 23:38:44 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	i started redoing windows and even got to reboot linux. nothing worked. then it just started to work again after i had run out of things to try. 
Mar 19 23:40:23 <sabl-C130>	Sounds like the same problem.  Maybe it is the RAF start up process.
Mar 19 23:40:34 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	i think it was RF01. they had redone the ads windows and took my pitch/roll/hgm232 window away. i had to disable auto cutoff to look down. i quit watching it then some time later i looked and it was working.
Mar 19 23:43:37 <--	sabl-C130 has quit (Ping timeout)
Mar 19 23:48:02 -->	sabl-C130 (sabl@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) has joined &SABL
Mar 19 23:48:27 <sabl-C130>	I flew RF01, RF02 maybe, when we lost the apd?  I looked in the book, you wrote "radar alt not reporting."
Mar 19 23:51:29 <sabl-C130>	test, anybody there?
Mar 19 23:52:28 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	yeah the first one i was on. talked to al S some more. looking at the flt track data off the web there was over 2 hours of no reporting. the data feed started again at about 2105 - the time it started up for you.
Mar 19 23:53:32 <sabl-C130>	Ta was having problems getting chat back up.
Mar 19 23:53:47 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	sory 2005 working again. sound right?
Mar 19 23:57:29 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	it is the nimbus raf system that ta messed up. that is what we need to have them look at next time we have this problem.
Mar 19 23:58:38 <sabl-C130>	Ya, just before that, maybe 3mins.
Mar 19 23:59:32 <sabl-C130>	Can you confirm nimbus status with your flight, RF02, is that easy?
Mar 19 23:59:41 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	so, it is a raf problem. nothing we can do but complain
Mar 20 00:00:27 <sabl-C130>	Have they had other nimbus problems other than other problem flights?
Mar 20 00:02:00 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	i do not know. al and i just came to this as a possible explaination while looking at flt track and xchat history.
Mar 20 00:03:08 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	going to room for break.
Mar 20 00:03:39 <sabl-C130>	I did the same.  Does he know/recall nimbus being a problem on other flights?  Janet would know, right?
Mar 20 00:04:40 <sabl-C130>	OK, I will do the same, crap, I will have to wait!
Mar 20 00:05:38 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	why are you concerned with other flts. it is their problem. al will pass info to janet
Mar 20 00:08:18 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	landing at 0211. only 8hr 41 min. going to room this time. really
Mar 20 00:08:52 <sabl-C130>	Just trying to make sure they are related.
Mar 20 00:09:08 <sabl-C130>	OK
Mar 20 00:42:50 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	back again
Mar 20 00:43:05 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	only 1.5 hours
Mar 20 00:50:20 <sabl-C130>	That's only 5,400 seconds!
Mar 20 01:08:13 <Bruce_Boulder>	Are you there yet?
Mar 20 01:14:38 <Bruce_Boulder>	You are getting your money's worth on this flight!
Mar 20 01:15:34 <sabl-C130>	where, here or there? Yes.
Mar 20 01:18:28 <sabl-C130>	Close to 3,600 seconds left!  I like the big numbers, they go down quick.
Mar 20 01:19:38 <Bruce_Boulder>	nanoseconds go down very fast!  Fortnights quite slow.
Mar 20 01:22:31 <sabl-C130>	I will save that for the next flight on the next project.
Mar 20 01:22:49 <sabl-C130>	Got to have something to look foward too.
Mar 20 01:23:01 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	we are leaving ops center now

Mar 20 01:56:44 <sabl-C130>	OK Bruce, thanks for the help today.  I know that it is Sunday there and I think here too.
Mar 20 01:57:33 <Bruce_Boulder>	There are no Sundays in the field!
Mar 20 01:58:05 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Somebody give Jonathon some water - he is delirious !
Mar 20 01:58:21 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	But there are HARD DOWN DAY Mondays
Mar 20 02:01:55 <sabl-C130>	There is no "Sat and Sun" in the field, but there are where Bruce is, aka Home.
Mar 20 02:02:35 <sabl-C130>	I am 10 min away from landing and saying good bye.
Mar 20 02:02:53 <Bruce_Boulder>	My brain is still in the field!  Bye!

Mar 22 15:16:39 <sabl-C130>	Mornin' Bruce, Laura here.  5 min before APU is turned on.
Mar 22 15:17:17 <Bruce_Boulder>	Ready for your first flight?
Mar 22 15:17:45 <sabl-C130>	Good question.  .  .
Mar 22 15:18:08 <Bruce_Boulder>	Are you solo or did sabl get to seats?
Mar 22 15:19:13 <sabl-C130>	Just me.  Mike is flying tomorrow.
Mar 22 15:19:56 <Bruce_Boulder>	After today you will see why we don't like to fly back-to-back days!
Mar 22 15:21:29 <Bruce_Boulder>	I have to go soon so I will miss your take off. Good luck!  Be back in an hour or so.
Mar 22 15:22:12 <sabl-C130>	Copy that, thanks.
Mar 22 15:22:22 <Bruce_Boulder>	Gordon, very nice job on the post flight displays - I would like to see your IDL code.
Mar 22 15:24:17 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Hi Bruce. Thanks. I'll send the code to you in a little while. In the end, it turned out to be quite a simple change, but I had to think about it for a while.
Mar 22 15:25:13 <Bruce_Boulder>	I was still in the thinking stage - had a few lines written but nothing close to testing.
Mar 22 15:26:24 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	I think I took a different approach to what you were planning.
Mar 22 15:26:59 <Bruce_Boulder>	If yours was simple, it was a different approach!

Mar 22 15:51:30 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	How's everything going up there ?
Mar 22 15:53:08 <sabl-C130>	Just waiting to level before I start SABL.
Mar 22 16:01:23 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	Laura, how's the fan working out ?
Mar 22 16:06:46 ---	sabl-ops-veracruz is now known as mstrong-ops-veracruz
Mar 22 16:09:00 <sabl-C130>	The fan is working great!  Laser started at 1405 UT.
Mar 22 16:09:44 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	hi laura. just checking that you  have got archiving and altitude lockout started also
Mar 22 16:10:11 <sabl-C130>	Yep.
Mar 22 16:10:52 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	excellent, sit back and enjoy the ride
Mar 22 16:11:09 <sabl-C130>	Thanks man!
Mar 22 16:13:51 <sabl-C130>	I have a digitizer error-"No interrupts."  What does this mean please?
Mar 22 16:15:24 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	one of the safety, pitch roll or alt, stopped the laser momentarily. laser will restart when safe again. check for red light and also on laptop on top of rack.
Mar 22 16:16:26 <sabl-C130>	Copy that, thanks.

Mar 22 16:51:09 <ericloew_ncar>	Everything going ok?

Mar 22 16:52:32 <ericloew_ncar>	Cool.
Mar 22 16:52:55 <ericloew_ncar>	Gordon: do you have a copy of Lhermitte's book on mm-wave radar?
Mar 22 16:53:59 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	No, I think Vivek is the only one I know that has a copy.
Mar 22 16:54:54 <ericloew_ncar>	Too bad. I looked in Jeff Keeler's office too. Perhaps I should buy a copy.

Mar 22 17:11:57 <sabl-C130>	It looks better now, don't know why.  Thanks.
Mar 22 17:14:07 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	need more detail. 
Mar 22 17:15:47 <Bruce_Boulder>	I am back - Laura, how are things going?
Mar 22 17:21:41 <sabl-C130>	Things are going well.
Mar 22 17:24:10 <Bruce_Boulder>	Temperature in the mid 90s?
Mar 22 17:27:39 <sabl-C130>	No, mid 80's.  
Mar 22 17:28:55 <Bruce_Boulder>	How did you manage to get a cool flight?
Mar 22 17:31:01 <sabl-C130>	Combination of two things:
Mar 22 17:31:24 <sabl-C130>	Better fan rack installed and higher alt flight.
Mar 22 17:31:57 <sabl-C130>	Today's flight plan is between 16000 and 8,000 ft.
Mar 22 17:34:30 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	forecast briefing just finished. looks like a bad day for flying tomorrow. el norte will be back worse than yesterday. estimate high winds.
Mar 22 17:36:45 <Bruce_Boulder>	Does that mean more snow in CO?
Mar 22 17:36:53 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	stronger than yesterday
Mar 22 17:37:20 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	not sure about the snow
Mar 22 17:51:37 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	yesterday winds were 30mph, gusting to 40mph. tomorrow 35-40 sustained, gusting to 50
Mar 22 17:52:31 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	bruce, what is news from trex and real.
Mar 22 18:32:32 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	laura, you just made a turn to the south. did you notice how the laser stopped/restarted with the roll angle exceeding 5 degrees?
Mar 22 18:43:59 <sabl-C130>	Yes.  We are currently turning again.
Mar 22 18:46:17 <Bruce_Boulder>	T-REX/REAL seems to be going well.  Working on some beam steering problems.
Mar 22 18:53:05 <sabl-C130>	What type of BSU problems?
Mar 22 18:58:48 <Bruce_Boulder>	Slip ring communication errors stop the BSU.
Mar 22 19:14:19 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	Laura, how are you doing up there ?
Mar 22 19:19:28 <sabl-C130>	Aside from lots of turbulence, just fine.  Thanks for asking.

Mar 22 20:46:57 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	you are finally back on chat. have you had a chance to look up yet? so far it looks like a boring flt, not much to do.
Mar 22 20:50:29 <sabl-C130>	I had to reset the linux machine once because it locked up.  Other than that a turbulent but un-eventful flight.
Mar 22 20:51:55 <sabl-C130>	The XChat is having issues, have you noticed in the Ops center?
Mar 22 20:53:20 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	yes, lots of drop outs today. more than the normal.
Mar 22 20:54:30 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	are you getting the digitizer warning windows when making turns?
Mar 22 20:55:31 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	just a reminder, when restarting linux. restart archiving and alt lockout
Mar 22 20:57:53 <sabl-C130>	I re-started all first thing.
Mar 22 20:59:03 <sabl-C130>	The digitizer warning is on desktop four.  I see the red panel light go on.
Mar 22 21:00:33 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	excellent. the linux pc almost always fails when there is a warning window up, creating a failure to refresh the windows in a quadrant. did you have a refresh problem?
Mar 22 21:00:36 <sabl-C130>	Data disk 11 still shows over twenty hours of space.
Mar 22 21:01:33 <sabl-C130>	The file size is changing, the Kb/sec is changing, and we have a green "running" in the window.
Mar 22 21:02:13 <sabl-C130>	Data disk 15 has 13 + hours re-maining.
Mar 22 21:04:49 <sabl-C130>	I am not sure what you mean, display and command and VX windows updating as usual.
Mar 22 21:06:31 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	the linux pc almost always fails when there is a warning window up, creating a failure to refresh the windows in a quadrant. did you have a refresh problem?
Mar 22 21:07:02 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	did the linux pc stop because of the windows
Mar 22 21:08:46 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	you reset it because it "locked up". what happened
Mar 22 21:11:14 <sabl-C130>	I don't know why the pc froze.  Toggling between windows 1,2 and 3 the windows were re-freshing/updating just fine until the pc froze.
Mar 22 21:12:35 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	did the keyboard and mouse stop, like this morning? 
Mar 22 21:13:22 <sabl-C130>	At first I noticed the mouse would move but the keyboard wouold not respond.
Mar 22 21:13:55 <sabl-C130>	I checked the cables and tried again.  Still keyboard would not respond.
Mar 22 21:14:45 <sabl-C130>	Then I noticed the computer clock was not updating the data display was not updating even though SABL had the green panel light.
Mar 22 21:15:02 <sabl-C130>	I re-set at that point and it came up fine.
Mar 22 21:16:16 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	did you just hit the bomb and restart sabl control or reboot the linux
Mar 22 21:17:06 <sabl-C130>	No, I could not hit the bomb because the keyboard was not responding.  I could move the mouse over the bomb but could not "click".
Mar 22 21:17:41 <sabl-C130>	Used the re-set in the rack.
Mar 22 21:20:11 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	ok. it still might have been a mouse problem like this morning. 
Mar 22 21:20:58 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	sometimes you have to jiggle and reset the cables more than once
Mar 22 21:21:58 <sabl-C130>	I checked the cables and re-seated them.  If it was a mouse problem I don't think that would cause the computer clock to stop and the SABL display to stop.
Mar 22 21:24:28 <--	ericloew_ncar has quit (Quit: Leaving)
Mar 22 21:25:12 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	computer clock - where? display or sabl control window
Mar 22 21:26:50 <sabl-C130>	Both.
Mar 22 21:29:17 <sabl-C130>	Just got another warning: :LASER controller is OFF!"  What does this mean?  I haven't turned anything off and auto lockout is still enabled.
Mar 22 21:29:23 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	during safety pauses, when laser is off, the display time goes away. i am not sure if the sabl control window time stop updating during a safety pause, but i doubt it would stop.
Mar 22 21:29:47 <sabl-C130>	Database alt entry is still enabled.
Mar 22 21:30:54 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	you will sometimes get that warning during safety pauses.
Mar 22 21:32:01 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	other times for that is when sometimes when you change from up 2 down
Mar 22 21:32:23 <sabl-C130>	Yes, I know when there is a safety pause the display stops updating.  However, the LASER was going, green panel light, red panel light OFF and both the display clock and data were not updating and the computer clock was not updating.
Mar 22 21:35:04 <sabl-C130>	Thanks for the laser controller warning info.  I have changed directions two times in the past two minutes.
Mar 22 21:36:20 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	you did the right thing, from what i can tell, by rebooting the linux. i am just trying to get you thinking about how the system works and interacts.
Mar 22 21:37:33 <sabl-C130>	Copy that, thank you.  All information much appreciated.
Mar 22 21:40:55 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	me, too. you have to admit that when a computer "froze" that alone doesnt give me much to work with.
Mar 22 21:42:34 <sabl-C130>	Sorry about that, we were in a bit of turbulence and I was not feeling "chatty".  
Mar 22 21:43:37 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	it took a while but we finally got there. xchat is not the best way to fix things - it can be painfully slow.
Mar 22 21:45:18 <sabl-C130>	I wrote down what happened and what I did in the SABL book so we could discuss later if need be.
Mar 22 21:48:58 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	logging can sometimes help later untangle problems. i think we have a pretty good understanding of this one.
Mar 22 21:50:51 <sabl-C130>	I agree.
Mar 22 21:58:27 <Bruce_Boulder>	Google Earth has you all over the place today!
Mar 22 22:00:04 <sabl-C130>	I tried to do a routine change of direction down to up and I keep getting a frantic scroll on VX.
Mar 22 22:00:28 <sabl-C130>	"Unable to Open socket to display computer.
Mar 22 22:00:44 <sabl-C130>	I hit off in the command window.
Mar 22 22:02:38 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	Laura, Mike has just gone up to his room. Let me see if I can find him.
Mar 22 22:05:05 <sabl-C130>	I've tried re-starting all with the bomb.  VX came back up and is telling me over and over, "Laser controller not responding".
Mar 22 22:05:36 <sabl-C130>	I can't get it to do anything.  Even with the Autolock disabled the red panel light on.
Mar 22 22:06:13 <sabl-C130>	Looking up we should be fine, the pitch and roll are both under 5 degrees.  So why is safety on?
Mar 22 22:08:29 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	Mike is on his way down. He should be here in a minute or two.
Mar 22 22:08:56 <sabl-C130>	Got it going again.  
Mar 22 22:09:18 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	Great ! What did you do ?
Mar 22 22:09:41 <sabl-C130>	It seems that the mirror got "confused" and didn't know where it was so had to be re-set.
Mar 22 22:11:58 <sabl-C130>	Hitting the bomb did not actually re-boot VX it seems, so I did a ctrl x from the VX window and that worked.
Mar 22 22:12:37 <sabl-C130>	When it fires up it always gets itself to 5 degrees so this is my guess.  I'm sorry Mike got called away from what he was doing.
Mar 22 22:13:07 <sabl-C130>	They just announced that we will be on the ground in about twenty minutes, yeah!
Mar 22 22:13:10 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	He was just getting ready to fetch you - he hasn't come down yet anyway.
Mar 22 22:13:19 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	Here he is now.
Mar 22 22:14:36 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	He is now on his way to fetch you.

Mar 23 20:35:45 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	Hi Bruce. Can you check your email - I'm having a problem processing the data collected yesterday
Mar 23 20:36:31 <Bruce_Boulder>	I will check my eamil.
Mar 23 20:37:19 <sabl-C130>	still about 90 all the time at the seat. the bigger fan helps alot. even blowing hot air on me is better than before
Mar 23 20:45:39 <Bruce_Boulder>	Gordon, check your email for some suggestion on data processing.
Mar 23 20:46:08 <Bruce_Boulder>	Mike, I wonder if we can install an AC or swamp cooler in the sabl rack?
Mar 23 20:48:12 <Bruce_Boulder>	What are you doing over the Yucatan?
Mar 23 20:54:54 <sabl-C130>	the plume was forecast to move into this area due to the front and el norte.
Mar 23 20:56:32 <sabl-C130>	you missed the el norte, tues the bottom of the pool was covered from el norte blown sand. another el norte is starting today, ending tomorrow.
Mar 23 20:58:27 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	Bruce, the first four files had screwy time stamps. I moved them to a subdirectory of RF08 called BAD_FILES.
Mar 23 20:59:21 <sabl-C130>	i got lucky. today is only to be 6 hours. yesterday was 7 for laura
Mar 23 20:59:56 <Bruce_Boulder>	Gordon, did that fix the problem?
Mar 23 21:00:12 <Bruce_Boulder>	Mike, lucky you!
Mar 23 21:00:18 <laura-ops-veracruz>	Watch out, today's flight hasn't landed yet.  .  .
Mar 23 21:01:08 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	So far, it is happy.
Mar 23 21:01:17 <sabl-C130>	laura has the linux pc showing clock problems at 2015
Mar 23 21:02:26 <sabl-C130>	if the bad files are at the start of rf08 it could be from the preflt ground testing
Mar 23 21:02:46 <Bruce_Boulder>	The data files also indicate clock problems.
Mar 23 21:03:00 <Bruce_Boulder>	I don't know - Eric may have some thoughts on that.
Mar 23 21:03:36 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	Mike, the problem data files were at the start of RF08, so maybe they are from the pre-flight ground testing.
Mar 23 21:08:42 <Bruce_Boulder>	If the IRIG time (from ads) is not on when the vx-works system is turn on, the vx-works time I think is elapsed time.
Mar 23 21:10:00 <Bruce_Boulder>	When the ads time gets turned on I think the vx-works (VME) time is then set to IRIG time.
Mar 23 21:11:24 <sabl-C130>	have either of you at the ops ctr got a update on el norte? is it starting to blow hard yet?
Mar 23 21:13:50 <laura-ops-veracruz>	We can hear the wind blowing strongly on the upper floors.  Haven't received a wx report yet. 
Mar 23 21:13:57 <laura-ops-veracruz>	I'll see what I can find out.
Mar 23 21:16:52 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	Mike, the pool doesn't have whitecaps yet, but it is close. It is blowing about as hard as it did the other day.
Mar 23 21:17:17 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	The pool is alrady full of sand.
Mar 23 21:25:48 <sabl-C130>	only 2 more hours!!
Mar 23 21:43:25 <sabl-C130>	are we recording the glycol temps to compare with this noise cycling. from looking at system running 32 degrees seems to have the best data.
Mar 23 21:44:42 <sabl-C130>	when hotter the signal gets worse.
Mar 23 21:45:30 <laura-ops-veracruz>	How do you record the glycol temp?
Mar 23 21:47:24 <sabl-C130>	at 2140 am seeing cycling in ir and green. it is in the ir near field. when the green signal fades the ir increases.
Mar 23 21:48:21 <sabl-C130>	gordon not this time and look at rf09 to give eric and bruce feedback
Mar 23 21:48:33 <sabl-C130>	note the time
Mar 23 21:50:26 <ericloew-boulder>	Mike, et al. Coolant temperature is logged and recorded, But at this point it's difficult to access. Gary G. started to make it available on netCdf. Don
Mar 23 21:50:36 <ericloew-boulder>	Don't know how far he got.
Mar 23 21:50:37 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	Noted.
Mar 23 21:53:48 <ericloew-boulder>	As for the earlier IRIG-B time question. If ADS is off (no IRIG-B), Sabl time starts @ 00:00:00. Once IRIG-B is available, the time is automatically updated. At present this does not cause a new file to be written. This should not be a problem once airborne.
Mar 23 21:54:41 <--	sabl-C130 has quit (Ping timeout)
Mar 23 22:13:18 <Bruce_Boulder>	I think Gary got that done.  I will check my email and let you know.
Mar 23 22:19:03 <Bruce_Boulder>	Gordon, Gary did put the temps in the netCDF file but that version in not yet on sabl-dq.  Check you email for details.

Mar 23 22:42:21 <crounse_c130>	now my xchat will not connect thru firewall
Mar 23 22:42:53 <crounse_c130>	had to change system harddrive after two power downs of linux pc
Mar 23 22:43:49 <ericloew-boulder>	Mike: do you think the problem is heat related? Did the drive fail?
Mar 23 22:44:10 <crounse_c130>	sabl control window would only accept 1 or 2 commands then not respond to any mouse click
Mar 23 22:44:11 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	Mike, I wonder if xchat was reconfigured on the one drive and not on the other.
Mar 23 22:44:47 <crounse_c130>	probably heat. could be disk - will find out tomorrow
Mar 23 22:45:13 <crounse_c130>	these boxes are pieces of sh..eetmetal
Mar 23 22:45:27 <crounse_c130>	we need new linux pcs
Mar 23 22:46:16 <crounse_c130>	others are having same xchat problems today
Mar 23 22:47:02 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	We should check to see if the system disks are really identical (asuuming the original one is still functional)
Mar 23 22:48:26 <crounse_c130>	our linux pc was trying to print something to jeffco. instead of getting on sabl pc and stopping print job they install firewall. other machines were searching for net also. some wanted to do linux version updates, etc.
Mar 23 22:49:18 <crounse_c130>	mike daniels worked late last night and all preflt to get it working, it is not quite there yet
Mar 23 22:49:50 <ericloew-boulder>	Agreed. I am looking for 2U replacements of the 1U's for ELDORA.

Mar 26 18:31:15 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	Hi Laura, how does the green channel look ?
Mar 26 18:34:44 <sabl-C130>	We just took off, haven't reached alt yet, I will let you know.
Mar 26 18:35:33 <sabl-C130>	Elliot has requested that once the laser is on he would like to have the SABL display up as much as possible.
Mar 26 18:35:53 <sabl-C130>	So, unless there is trouble expect me to be pretty quiet.
Mar 26 18:37:05 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	Did you guys have a chance to look over cable connections in the pod ?
Mar 26 18:47:10 <sabl-C130>	I didn't know we were supposed to.
Mar 26 18:48:19 <sabl-C130>	Both the green and the IR look flat, scale is set to 10 to 30 and I'm not seeing anything over about 22 dB.
Mar 26 18:48:36 <sabl-C130>	Should I be concerned?  It did rain last night so perhaps the air is cleaner?
Mar 26 18:55:15 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	I have been concerned about the green channel signal level. Mike said that if he had a chance, he may have a look at some cables.
Mar 26 18:55:58 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	What do you mean by "flat" - do you mean that there is no variation in the signal level ?
Mar 26 19:02:31 ---	sabl-ops-veracruz is now known as mstrong-ops-veracruz
Mar 26 19:05:53 <sabl-C130>	We are looking down and both channels look pretty good.  Some noise in the green but doesn't look too bad to me.
Mar 26 19:07:33 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	great. when you change from up/down just be sure you are getting good laser signal, if not just try to restart laser with STOP-RUN
Mar 26 19:08:55 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	with all the rain and clouds it may be hard to see pollution layers. nothing we can do about the weather. 
Mar 26 19:10:13 <sabl-C130>	The optics fault like has been on for about twenty minutes.  Anything I can do about it?
Mar 26 19:10:57 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	those are for the optics heaters. telling you when they are turning on and off
Mar 26 19:12:55 <sabl-C130>	The Optics Heater light is green, it is off, the Optics Fault light is red and it is on.
Mar 26 19:14:34 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	you can check on the sabl control panel that optics temp is 30-35 degrees. just ignore the optics lights.
Mar 26 19:16:22 <sabl-C130>	Copy that, everything looks good on the SABL control.  Thanks.

Mar 26 19:35:51 <sabl-C130>	Does anyone know if Sasha knows the cutoff for the LIDAR looking down?
Mar 26 19:36:15 <sabl-C130>	We went through the roll looking down and we are still looking down even though the HGM232 reads well below 2km.
Mar 26 19:36:44 <sabl-C130>	So we are not getting any data?  Should I say something or just assume he knows?
Mar 26 19:37:19 <sabl-C130>	I meant to say we went through the spiral not the roll.
Mar 26 19:37:56 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	good of you to catch that. did you do the iru_set.... after takeoff? did you enable the auto lockout on the sabl control window?
Mar 26 19:38:52 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	auto lockout and data alt input on sabl control
Mar 26 19:39:10 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	iru_set.... should not be done during a flt
Mar 26 19:39:39 <sabl-C130>	Yes to all.  It just seems we should be looking up not down to maximize data collection.
Mar 26 19:39:42 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	if iru-set_.... is done all safety is OFF
Mar 26 19:41:35 <mstrong-ops-veracruz>	during the spiral is should be in safety off, doesnt matter what up/down. when you level off again then ask for whether up or down

Mar 28 11:38:27 <sabl-C130>	Yes, The desciosn has been made to fly the the fight unless the engine statusd changes.  The engine has been visually inspected and looks clean.\

Mar 28 14:14:17 <sabl-C130>	only 5 more hours!!
Mar 28 14:17:21 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	How does the green channel look today ? Do you stil have to lower the color scale minimum ?
Mar 28 14:18:41 <sabl-C130>	it has started to fall off a little
Mar 28 14:34:05 <sabl-C130>	i think we might have a loose connection on the alt safety. when we were taking offf and bumping along the runway the red lamp was flickering. now it pulses occasionally when we are in turbulance.
Mar 28 14:35:54 <sabl-C130>	i can not see it in the display, the pulses are too short. maybe post analysis will show some breaks in the data
Mar 28 14:36:25 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	This may explain the dropouts that I have seen in the data files - Sometimes it looks like the lidar cuts out for no apparent reason. Bruce also pointed this out last week.
Mar 28 14:39:19 <sabl-C130>	first i have heard about this. we can look at the wires in the pod after the flt today.
Mar 28 14:40:44 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	It doesn't seem to be that serious - they aren't large dropouts.
Mar 28 14:41:37 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	Bruce's original post processing display code did'nt show the periods whenthe lidar is inactive - we can only see this now because of the changes I made to the code.
Mar 28 14:41:56 <sabl-C130>	if the wire breaks we will have to run with the alt safety disables
Mar 28 14:42:29 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	if there is another flight...
Mar 28 14:48:52 <sabl-C130>	another thing, it may be the aircraft feed it sending some spikes that we are detecting. only seems to happen when things are bumpy, though. they might have some connection issurs too.
Mar 28 14:51:02 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	I've just checked the altitude information on the Google maps display - there have been a lot of dropouts in the past half an hour
Mar 28 14:51:12 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	I'm going to ask Al S about this now
Mar 28 14:53:58 <gordonf-ops-veracruz>	Al is checking on the altitude feed now
Mar 28 14:55:00 <sabl-C130>	just talked to raf tech. they have been having problems that might be related.

Mar 29 18:10:57 <sabl-ops-veracruz>	It may be that there is nothing to see. If you don't see anything for a while, you could ask Frank if you could look down, just to check the system.
