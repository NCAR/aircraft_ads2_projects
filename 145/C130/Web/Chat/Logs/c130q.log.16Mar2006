I'm comfortable with talking you through the steps, but there is a risk of damaging a circuit board if we are not careful.  Because of this, I'd like to take a lot of time explaining things, and would ask that you chat backup to me your understanding of my request, to make sure we understand each other fully.  Are you wi

[GMT 03/16/06 18:38:40] <TeresaCampos_CamReal> Bill, that's good news.  If the instrument continues to operate, then let's not make *any* modifications.  
[GMT 03/16/06 18:39:49] <billirwin-c130> ok
[GMT 03/16/06 18:40:08] <TeresaCampos_CamReal> Bill, Jonathan, or Elliot:  Would one of you guys chat up to me the raw counts (F2 on the touchscreen)?
[GMT 03/16/06 18:40:27] <billirwin-c130> elliot informs me it's back off, was on for approx. 5 minutes or so
[GMT 03/16/06 18:41:32] <TeresaCampos_CamReal> Please ask Elliot what the raw count rate was during the time the lamp was on? 
[GMT 03/16/06 18:43:53] <billirwin-c130> he didn't read raw counts but reports it was showing something around 120 ppb
[GMT 03/16/06 18:46:05] <TeresaCampos_CamReal> Unfortunately, you can't tell whether the lamp is on by reading ppb, one really needs to look at the raw count rate (F2 on the touchscreen) to tell whether the lamp has turned on.
[GMT 03/16/06 18:48:57] <TeresaCampos_CamReal> So Bill, would you like to try the tricky maneuver to speed up the lamp lighting?  Would it also help communications if we move the the techs' chat room?

[GMT 03/16/06 21:03:35] <JanetScannell-jeffco> Ping times to the aircraft are extremely slow today, so that is what is happening with the real-time data feed.  The computer on the ground can't keep the connection to the aircraft long enough to get data.  I can't even log on the aircraft which I usually can do.
[GMT 03/16/06 21:04:37] <JanetScannell-jeffco> Maybe someone on the plane is swamping the bandwidth with web surfing or some other process that is communicating with the ground and slowing everything down.

[GMT 03/16/06 21:06:29] <JanetScannell-jeffco> This shouldn't be tied into the timegap problem as they are separate processes.

[GMT 03/16/06 21:16:26] <billirwin-c130> as best as two people remember, somebody on board this airplane was either uploading or downloading extra stuff approx 3 hours ago

[GMT 03/16/06 21:53:03] <DannyOpsRm3> We recommend that you turn south and try and pick up either plan 5 or 5a depending on what your weather radar shows ahead.
[GMT 03/16/06 21:53:50] <DannyOpsRm3> Ground radars are not available on web.

[GMT 03/16/06 21:54:29] <DannyOpsRm3> Sat images at least 30 min late so Bill recommends relaying more on your weather radar than on our feedback.
[GMT 03/16/06 21:54:51] <adsCockpit-c130> going to Plan B
[GMT 03/16/06 21:55:16] <adsCockpit-c130> 5B that is there is no 5a

[GMT 03/16/06 22:50:07] <AWeinheimer-Veracruz> is indeed very sparse; also NOy curiously constant a few hrs ago
[GMT 03/16/06 22:50:33] <Chris_> Those apparent "constant" periods are data dropout.
