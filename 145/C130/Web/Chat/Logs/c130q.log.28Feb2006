[GMT 02/28/06 15:52:26] <pavel-jeffco> Hi Janet, can you start GE tracking?
[GMT 02/28/06 15:52:59] <JanetScannell-Veracruz> It's been in the 70's lately.  It's supposed to be 80's all this week.
[GMT 02/28/06 15:53:32] <JanetScannell-Veracruz> I'm working on the Google problem at the moment.  The database is partially corrupted so the new data is not getting put in.
[GMT 02/28/06 15:54:01] <pavel-jeffco> Allright, I see.
[GMT 02/28/06 16:05:00] <BillIrwin-C130> i knew i was on this flight for something, fixed the bathroom lite!!
[GMT 02/28/06 16:07:48] <BillIrwin-C130> radar altimeter still looks good
[GMT 02/28/06 16:08:37] <pavel-jeffco> Awesome, thanks, Bill! (applies to both the light and altimeter :-)
[GMT 02/28/06 16:11:39] <Jcowan-Jeffco> GE has the plane returing to Jeffco.  I'm hoping you are in New Mexico by now???
[GMT 02/28/06 16:12:39] <pavel-jeffco> The last line in the kml file is bad, same as first. It must signify strong ties to the home base.

[GMT 02/28/06 16:26:45] <bruce> sabl-C130 this is bruce in Veracruz 
[GMT 02/28/06 16:29:40] <bruce> BillIrwin-C130 - please ask Mike Strong to meet me on the sabl chat line - thanks
[GMT 02/28/06 16:32:30] <BillIrwin-C130> he's headed there
[GMT 02/28/06 16:40:45] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Bill, The users that are using the GV racks on the 130, are they our racks or thiers?  Also the wheels in the hanger are the ours (we will put them up) or thiers (we will stow them)?
[GMT 02/28/06 16:45:21] <BillIrwin-C130> fried's group believe's they purchased them, don't know about wheels, i think we stole them from the gv hanger, will check with other gv rack user, hang on
[GMT 02/28/06 16:47:00] <BillIrwin-C130> it seems all these racks were purchased by the users here, don't know about wheels, if purchased via our machine shop, they may've been included....nobody here knows for sure about the wheels
[GMT 02/28/06 16:47:39] <adsCockpit-c130> wheels are included when you buy a rack from Jack
[GMT 02/28/06 16:50:10] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Okay we will tag the wheels as user gear until we hear different.  I am guessing that we (RAF) will need to "brand" our stuff to make sure that we don't lose it.
[GMT 02/28/06 16:54:37] <pavel-jeffco> I agree.

[GMT 02/28/06 17:19:11] <sabl-C130> go ahead tc
[GMT 02/28/06 17:20:01] <TeresaCampos-DFW> Thanks much, sabl!  The CO instrument is the 4U box just under the storage unit.  The lamp switch is on the inboard rear panel and is somewhat obscured by our manual valve.
[GMT 02/28/06 17:20:12] <sabl-C130> tc, are you really in dfw?
[GMT 02/28/06 17:20:32] <TeresaCampos-DFW> When on, the toggle should be in the up position, and yes I am between flights at DFW on my way to Mx City!
[GMT 02/28/06 17:20:51] <TeresaCampos-DFW> Are you guys close to here?
[GMT 02/28/06 17:21:58] <sabl-C130> the switch is UP
[GMT 02/28/06 17:22:31] <TeresaCampos-DFW> Yay.  Thanks very much.  Cliff had emailed me with doubts that he had remembered to turn this on.  Have a good rest of the ferry.
[GMT 02/28/06 17:23:55] <sabl-C130> understood, the usual rush-rush this morning.
