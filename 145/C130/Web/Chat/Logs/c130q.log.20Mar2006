[GMT 03/20/06 00:06:08] <stephens_ops> so, instrument display looks OK but ADS values drop out? if so, it's likely something in the D/A and probably won't affect the primary data
[GMT 03/20/06 00:08:04] <DataSystem-c130> Britt, <i did not catch it on the instrument but that does not mean it was not there.  <just don't know.  Current ETA is 02:11, Cliff
