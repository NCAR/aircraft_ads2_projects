[GMT 03/17/06 14:58:45] <AlSchanot-ops> I don't see anything on ION
[GMT 03/17/06 15:03:29] <billirwin-c130> hey al, restarted nimbus here, seeing ac tracker sending increasing numbers of records to ground, so you should be seeing ion data
[GMT 03/17/06 15:04:23] <AlSchanot-ops> Nothing coming thru
[GMT 03/17/06 15:04:39] <AlSchanot-ops> Keep it running for now & I will have Janet check in.
[GMT 03/17/06 15:05:28] <billirwin-c130> ok, will keep it on, record numbers are jumping higher very quickly, data records sent to ground

[GMT 03/17/06 15:12:20] <AlSchanot-ops> I sent an email to Janet, Kurt & Pavel and asked them all to come up oin chat and check ION from their end.
[GMT 03/17/06 15:12:34] <billirwin-c130> i really think it's something on the "other" end
[GMT 03/17/06 15:12:59] <AlSchanot-ops> I agree, but there is a lot of pressure for data access during the flights
[GMT 03/17/06 15:13:16] <AlSchanot-ops> Now is the time to try and get this fixed!
[GMT 03/17/06 15:13:38] <billirwin-c130> understand, wonder how we did research the first 35 years?

[GMT 03/17/06 15:35:35] <billirwin-c130> i see ion data records on ac tracker increasing, chat works fine, numbus up and running, yet nobody seems to see ion data...i'd thought if chat works, shouldn't ion data...we don't do anything on this end to differentiate on this end do we?

[GMT 03/17/06 15:39:34] <ChrisWebster-GV> So everything looks good onboard, just on the ground?
[GMT 03/17/06 15:39:43] <ChrisWebster-GV> just NOT on the ground?
[GMT 03/17/06 15:40:13] <billirwin-c130> that's my understanding, al, said he saw one google earth link point this morning, that was it
[GMT 03/17/06 15:41:00] <ChrisWebster-GV> Are you airborne now?
[GMT 03/17/06 15:41:45] <billirwin-c130> no, on ground
[GMT 03/17/06 15:42:23] <ChrisWebster-GV> What's take off time?
[GMT 03/17/06 15:43:14] <billirwin-c130> al reports data center suffered power outage, power is back, but no outside links are up, he reported seeing google earth with one point at 9:15, but nothing since, no time updates
[GMT 03/17/06 15:44:09] <billirwin-c130> no take off today, maintenance day only
[GMT 03/17/06 15:44:28] <ChrisWebster-GV> oh.  Data is coming into database.
[GMT 03/17/06 15:44:34] <ChrisWebster-GV> ground database.
[GMT 03/17/06 15:45:03] <ChrisWebster-GV> I don't know about ION, but google stuff won't add anything until TASX is greater than 20m/s....
[GMT 03/17/06 15:45:14] <billirwin-c130> cool
[GMT 03/17/06 15:45:32] <billirwin-c130> so, you see ion data in boulder?
[GMT 03/17/06 15:46:46] <ChrisWebster-GV> I didn't say that.  I see data updates in the database, which feeds both ION and GoogleEarth/Map.

[GMT 03/17/06 15:47:28] <billirwin-c130> so chris, still no ion data here, do you want us to keep data link up and you can work on it, or what, as they HAVE to have ION data here at ops center
[GMT 03/17/06 15:47:41] <ChrisWebster-GV> GoogleEarth/Map just doesn't use any points from the database where TAS < 20.
[GMT 03/17/06 15:48:06] <ChrisWebster-GV> The need ION data today (for maintenance purposes)?
[GMT 03/17/06 15:48:07] <billirwin-c130> ok, understand google earth issue, need ion issue as that's most important to science here
[GMT 03/17/06 15:48:33] <ChrisWebster-GV> Or just working by next flight?
[GMT 03/17/06 15:48:38] <billirwin-c130> last flight ion didn't work well at all, tomorrow we fly again, it needs to work as it did earlier

[GMT 03/17/06 15:49:22] <ChrisWebster-GV> Yesterday we stopped getting data into the database, i.e. aircraft transfers were not happening to the database.
[GMT 03/17/06 15:49:53] <billirwin-c130> can we help you by keeping the data running today, or is it fixable from your end without this link up?...
[GMT 03/17/06 15:51:40] <ChrisWebster-GV> Leave it up right now, let me see if Janet is in yet....
[GMT 03/17/06 15:52:18] <billirwin-c130> yes, we think we had multiple issue's yesterday, including someone on board transferring files down or up via link, also many tight turns which kill the link, but there were times when we were flight level and still no ion data

[GMT 03/17/06 16:04:08] <pavel-jeffco> So, Allen tells us to join but he's not on chat himself?
[GMT 03/17/06 16:05:05] <pavel-jeffco> I can't see ION data but I can see some temperature and altitude data in GoogleMaps data window.
[GMT 03/17/06 16:05:40] <billirwin-c130> hey janet, just to bring u up to speed here, we had lots of ion problems yesterday, some self inflicted (tight turns and we think someone was hogging bandwidth with file upload/downloads...won't happen again) but also with straight flight and still no ion data getting to ops center, today on ground maintenance day, we're sending ion now, yet they were not seeing it at ops center
[GMT 03/17/06 16:07:55] <anstett-boulder> The problems yesterday were all due to whoever was swamping the bandwidth.  As I mentioned to Al, we only received 17 minutes of real-time data on the ground after 16:33 UTC.  The data couldn't get to the ground because the bandwidth was being hogged by others.  Therefore, Google and ION will not work if there is no data to display.
[GMT 03/17/06 16:11:04] <billirwin-c130> it's difficult for me to imagine that of a 9 hour flight that only 17 minutes of data would be able to get through, and that doesn't explain why ion didn't work today
[GMT 03/17/06 16:11:05] ChrisWebster-Jeffco (cjw@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &C130Q.
[GMT 03/17/06 16:16:58] <anstett-boulder> Yesterday, the first hour came through fine.  Someone must have been transferring a huge file or web surfing or something.  Ping times to the plane yesterday were 40 seconds instead of 40 ms.  This did not allow any data to be transferred.  I am looking at ion now to see what is happening today.  
[GMT 03/17/06 16:19:41] <anstett-boulder> Actually you will not get any ION data unless you are flying.  I made some changes yesterday to fix problems with compressed scales in ION.  Now you will not see ION data unless tas is > 20.
[GMT 03/17/06 16:20:46] <billirwin-c130> ok, al didn't know that
[GMT 03/17/06 16:21:18] <pavel-jeffco> But the data in G-Maps for RF05 are real, right?
[GMT 03/17/06 16:22:08] <anstett-boulder> This fixes problems with spikes in the data causing large scales and therefore not being able to view the data easily.
[GMT 03/17/06 16:23:07] <billirwin-c130> ok, that's the missing information we've been seeking, we were not aware that ion would no longer work on ground, if you don't need us anymore we're going to shut down today then
[GMT 03/17/06 16:23:18] ChrisWebster-Jeffco (cjw@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Quit: Leaving
[GMT 03/17/06 16:25:32] <anstett-boulder> The Google stuff also has the tas > 20 feature, so the RF05 data should be from yesterday's flight.
[GMT 03/17/06 16:29:37] <billirwin-c130> ok, janet thanks, messages passed on to "El Heffe" Schanot, we're be shutting down here in 5 minutes
[GMT 03/17/06 16:31:39] <billirwin-c130> anybody got anything else for us, otherwise we'll be signing off for today
[GMT 03/17/06 16:32:19] <anstett-boulder> By the way,  all the data from today has appeared on the ground now that someone is not hogging the bandwidth.  
[GMT 03/17/06 16:32:50] <billirwin-c130> cept u can't see it because of the TAS being off, correct?
[GMT 03/17/06 16:33:16] <anstett-boulder> The data started at 14:56 UTC today.
[GMT 03/17/06 16:33:32] <billirwin-c130> about right
[GMT 03/17/06 16:34:10] <anstett-boulder> Right, the data is on the ground in the database, but all the programs look for tas > 20.  The programs won't display any of the data in the database, unless tas is > 20.
[GMT 03/17/06 16:35:37] <billirwin-c130> ok then, i'm signing off, see ya next week, when cowan comes down
