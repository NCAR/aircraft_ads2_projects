[GMT 03/31/06 17:20:05] <pavel-jeffco> Allright, that IS important. Make sure to zoom in as much as you can.
[GMT 03/31/06 17:20:13] <wengangZh-Boulder> Hi, Frank. I did, thanks, is everything ok?
[GMT 03/31/06 17:20:18] <adsCockpit-c130> no Wengang. You just got into the conversation
[GMT 03/31/06 17:20:18] <DataSystem-c130> We have been paid by the mexican tourist board to help them out <g>.
[GMT 03/31/06 17:20:44] <DataSystem-c130> He we do important research on these ferry legs.
[GMT 03/31/06 17:20:51] <pavel-jeffco> Ok, this is what I thought. Now, I need an ETA for other important purposes.
[GMT 03/31/06 17:21:13] <adsCockpit-c130> Wengang - yes, there was a little scare this morning some of the buttons had been touched when the pump was strapped down in fron of the rack
[GMT 03/31/06 17:21:25] <DataSystem-c130> Wait one.
[GMT 03/31/06 17:22:10] <adsCockpit-c130> Wengang - got luck I got the system back. Had no reference here about which is which so I played with the first two ones
[GMT 03/31/06 17:22:17] <wengangZh-Boulder> That's what I hate about those pot knobs ... you get the signal back ok?
[GMT 03/31/06 17:22:24] <DataSystem-c130> Henry say 2055 right now. or about 1400 your time.
[GMT 03/31/06 17:22:24] <adsCockpit-c130> Got lucky got it back.
[GMT 03/31/06 17:22:39] <pavel-jeffco> Ok, thank you for the ETA!
[GMT 03/31/06 17:22:57] <adsCockpit-c130> We need to address this. If possible Roger should put lockable ones in during the two weeks
[GMT 03/31/06 17:23:00] <wengangZh-Boulder> Nice to hear that, hope it did not take you too long
[GMT 03/31/06 17:23:10] <DataSystem-c130> Do you need another update?\
[GMT 03/31/06 17:23:14] <adsCockpit-c130> or we come up with a cover plate for the box
[GMT 03/31/06 17:23:15] <wengangZh-Boulder> yes, that's what I thought
[GMT 03/31/06 17:24:13] <adsCockpit-c130> we also need to make a reference list of what's what and a new sticker for on the blue box
[GMT 03/31/06 17:24:31] <wengangZh-Boulder> Ok, I will do that
[GMT 03/31/06 17:25:13] <wengangZh-Boulder> I will ask roger for those lockable knobs too
[GMT 03/31/06 17:25:47] <adsCockpit-c130> need 11 of them

[GMT 03/31/06 18:00:55] <ChrisCantrell-Boulder> too bad you can't do some profiling
[GMT 03/31/06 18:01:38] <adsCockpit-c130> we will take an in-route profile in the Amarillo area - see whether there is still some smoke around

[GMT 03/31/06 19:28:49] <AWeinheimer-Veracruz> Frank, will do, if you can tell me how.
[GMT 03/31/06 19:29:57] <adsCockpit-c130> Andy thx. Look for MODIS rapid response on the web
[GMT 03/31/06 19:30:19] <adsCockpit-c130> this web site has the latest pics
[GMT 03/31/06 19:30:49] <adsCockpit-c130> they typically become avail 1-2 hours after overpass
[GMT 03/31/06 19:30:59] <adsCockpit-c130> AQUA typically overpasses around 10 am I think
[GMT 03/31/06 19:31:04] <kurt-RAF> John, I left Pavel a voice mail.  Do the pilots have a phone number incase Pavel dosen't have it.
[GMT 03/31/06 19:31:31] <adsCockpit-c130> I just also heard that the fire near Amarillo is still active
[GMT 03/31/06 19:31:52] <adsCockpit-c130> do you remember where it was? to the NE of the city??
[GMT 03/31/06 19:32:35] <DataSystem-c130> Kurt, Pass that information onto Lowell he has the phone number.
[GMT 03/31/06 19:34:30] <AWeinheimer-Veracruz> yes, I think yesterday's fire to the NE
[GMT 03/31/06 19:35:06] <AWeinheimer-Veracruz> can see orange patch (last 12 hrs) on MODIS map for that
[GMT 03/31/06 19:37:16] <CH2O_C130> Hey Andy, short question the weight of your PXI computer?
[GMT 03/31/06 19:38:46] <adsCockpit-c130> Thx. we have a report now. The fire is W of the airport
[GMT 03/31/06 19:39:14] <AWeinheimer-Veracruz> don't know weight, sorry

[GMT 03/31/06 20:38:57] <kurt-RAF> the NCAR A/D card, all channels should report to it, the diamond should have what?? 
[GMT 03/31/06 20:40:04] <DataSystem-c130> The Diamond card has one channel going to it that is Teed off the patch panel.  It should be one of the Pdumps.
[GMT 03/31/06 20:40:22] <DataSystem-c130> Also, there is one channel #4 I think that it suspected as being bad.
[GMT 03/31/06 20:40:57] <DataSystem-c130> The NCAR A/D should be in A1 and the dimond in A0.
[GMT 03/31/06 20:41:37] <kurt-RAF> We've swapped out the bad A/D and seems the input were reversed.  All the inputs went to the diamond??
[GMT 03/31/06 20:41:43] <DataSystem-c130> I think it is Pdumpl but I'm not sure.  It was the second or third channel on the NCAR board.
[GMT 03/31/06 20:43:26] <DataSystem-c130> When I left the Diamond was board 0 and ours was board 1. Meaning that as you looked at the patch panel the NCAR board has cables going t the center row of connectors and plugging inot the A1 connector on the back of ther DSM.
[GMT 03/31/06 20:43:41] <kurt-RAF> Ok only one channnel to the diamind.  That's what I remembered.
