[GMT 03/19/06 18:13:51] <TeresaCampos-CamReal> Hi Cliff.  Our T sensors are on the cell, and anything less than 60C or so is not a problem.  Our CO2 vulnerability lies in the licor board.  JFETs have been known to fail when T is somewhere between 50 and 60C.
[GMT 03/19/06 18:14:53] <sasha_VerOpCtr> Frank, Rahul requesting info on any SABL layers below, so he can put balloons in layers

[GMT 03/19/06 18:17:59] <TeresaCampos-CamReal> Cliff: 60C = 3V.

[GMT 03/19/06 18:23:57] <NOxyO3_C130> TeresaCampos-CamReal, I remember.  What I don't remember is the scale in volts that represents the temp of the cell.  Everything appears to be OK so far.  The time sync for CO2 was done late and there is a note in the log showing the offset up to sync as well as after sync.

[GMT 03/19/06 19:38:33] <DataSystem-c130> Janet,I did restart nimbus,Do you got real time data now?
[GMT 03/19/06 19:38:34] <adsCockpit-c130> Jose J.  Peter says it's working but he is not 100% convinced it's fixed
[GMT 03/19/06 19:38:49] <sasha_VerOpCtr> ok thanks Frank
[GMT 03/19/06 19:39:10] <adsCockpit-c130> Mass spec showing just a little cabin air
[GMT 03/19/06 19:39:13] <Chris> Becky - does it look like the valves are switching and flows are okay?  Lenses ok?
[GMT 03/19/06 19:39:13] <JanetScannell-boulder> Yes, the data is coming to the ground now.  Thanks.
[GMT 03/19/06 19:39:13] <NOxyO3_C130> Chris - I'm regretting that we didn't clean the rear injector, too. The intercomp. was a bust.
[GMT 03/19/06 19:39:13] <NOxyO3_C130> Chris - the background numbers (in the measurement mode - 8 s) are approximately 5000, and the signals range from 1500 to 7000.
[GMT 03/19/06 19:39:46] <adsCockpit-c130> much less than yesterday though

[GMT 03/19/06 19:40:42] <Chris> Becky - Well maybe we can figure out rough backgrounds another way.  Maybe try the overfilling without the Hg lamp on (even though that hasn't worked terribly well in the past).
[GMT 03/19/06 19:41:09] <NOxyO3_C130> Chris - miraculously, yes - the lenses look fine. We're getting NO3 through no problem. The flows look okay, the valves are switching. I even tried to verify that the SO2 and NO lines (new) weren't switched. What's weird is that I'm getting signals around 1000 for HO2 + RO2, but 5000 for just HO2. I don't get it. 
[GMT 03/19/06 19:41:33] <Chris> Becky - OH and NH3 and computer working ok?
[GMT 03/19/06 19:42:14] <NOxyO3_C130> Chris - will do. Any other suggestions?
[GMT 03/19/06 19:42:36] <DannyOpsRm2> Frank when are you interested in Balloon position info?
[GMT 03/19/06 19:42:37] <NOxyO3_C130> NH3 is making the HO2 elec. bkg go up, but not the OH. OH looks okay most of the time. Some small flow program problems... that's all. still getting data.
[GMT 03/19/06 19:42:46] <Chris> Becky - Sound like N2 diluent not getting to the front, maybe?  Maybe try cycling the reagent gases without diluents
[GMT 03/19/06 19:43:38] <NOxyO3_C130> Chris - I'm running right now with no diluents to see whether or not the values will get closer...
[GMT 03/19/06 19:44:33] <Chris> Becky - also make sure that the reagent gases got set to the correct values in the program reshuffle NO about 2.3 and 23, SO2 about 11 and 110 (at sea level).  
[GMT 03/19/06 19:45:22] <NOxyO3_C130> Chris - will do. 
[GMT 03/19/06 19:45:35] <Chris> Becky - good luck.
[GMT 03/19/06 19:46:17] <NOxyO3_C130> Chris - I'm going to head back to the rack. Ask someone to pass on anything else you might think of if you think of anything.

[GMT 03/19/06 21:57:37] <RahulZaveri-veracruz> Frank, did you mean you saw pollution layer at 15500 ft MSL near the globos on your way north?
[GMT 03/19/06 22:00:03] <JanetScannell-boulder> Danny: I'm not seeing what you are seeing in the ION plots.  Unless you mean the spikes that are occuring in the data.
[GMT 03/19/06 22:01:57] <NOxyO3_C130> JanetScannell-boulder, does the new google maps thing have all the serial variables that ion does?

[GMT 03/19/06 22:07:01] <JanetScannell-boulder> Google Maps does not have all the variables that ION does.  The only reason that ION has them is that I added them at the last minute because of a request to do this.
[GMT 03/19/06 22:08:37] <adsCockpit-c130> no not near the globos at 15500
[GMT 03/19/06 22:08:54] <adsCockpit-c130> that was 2 deg furthrt N
[GMT 03/19/06 22:09:15] <adsCockpit-c130> we are now heading towards the S again
[GMT 03/19/06 22:09:30] <RahulZaveri-veracruz> ok. Are u planning to sample at 11000 ft near the globos on your way back.
[GMT 03/19/06 22:10:09] <RahulZaveri-veracruz> I can give u the coordinates as you get closer... I can see both the globos and C130 on google earth
[GMT 03/19/06 22:10:15] <adsCockpit-c130> yes will be going there at 11000 or so.
[GMT 03/19/06 22:10:34] <adsCockpit-c130> will be there in ~ 1 hour

[GMT 03/19/06 22:16:32] <DataSystem-c130> Hey Britt, you're going to download from 3 instruments after the flight today?  One can only hope you don't run into the smallest glitch.  Thanks for picking it up.  I can still help with whatever.  I'm hot, not dead  Cliff
[GMT 03/19/06 22:18:39] <adsCockpit-c130> thx Rahul, ot it
[GMT 03/19/06 22:19:15] <stephens_ops> agreed Cliff, that's why I said 'try' - CO2 is full so has to be downloaded before the next flight, but TC still needs to troubleshoot that.  Glad you're surviving.

[GMT 03/19/06 22:31:09] <DannyOpsRm2> We will send positions every ten minutes
[GMT 03/19/06 22:31:34] <DannyOpsRm2> Stand by for first coordinates from Rahul
[GMT 03/19/06 22:33:22] <adsCockpit-c130> royer that
[GMT 03/19/06 22:33:38] <adsCockpit-c130> that's 4 degrees - 1 hour can only do one leg if it's that far.
[GMT 03/19/06 22:33:43] <adsCockpit-c130> why so far west???
[GMT 03/19/06 22:35:18] <adsCockpit-c130> balloon 1 is E of 98....
[GMT 03/19/06 22:36:20] <DannyOpsRm2> Frank this is suggestion to bracke t both balloons could cut short the westerly point to 98 45'W if that saves time
[GMT 03/19/06 22:36:33] <DannyOpsRm2> yes second balloon is west of 98W
[GMT 03/19/06 22:37:14] <adsCockpit-c130> both balloons are east of 98
[GMT 03/19/06 22:37:35] <RahulZaveri-veracruz> thats correct

[GMT 03/19/06 22:39:31] <adsCockpit-c130> 98.5 we can probably do but that's the extent we had in the plan
[GMT 03/19/06 22:39:46] <adsCockpit-c130> we have to save time somewhere otherwise there will be no time for a city run

[GMT 03/19/06 22:43:55] <adsCockpit-c130> also sems to me we should run at 24 30' it will take us an hour to complete the whole run
[GMT 03/19/06 22:45:54] <adsCockpit-c130> 24 20' that is
[GMT 03/19/06 22:46:42] <adsCockpit-c130> we will run at 10500 feet and back at 11500 feet probably - depending on SABL's output
[GMT 03/19/06 22:46:59] <adsCockpit-c130> if the balloons stay at ~11000 then we would have enough separation
[GMT 03/19/06 22:47:23] <adsCockpit-c130> are you using GPS or pressure altitude for the GLOBOS???
[GMT 03/19/06 22:47:32] <DannyOpsRm2> suggest start (24 15'N  96 30'W) - end ( 24 15'N 98 00'W) at FL105
[GMT 03/19/06 22:47:52] <DannyOpsRm2> Indicated pressure altitude
[GMT 03/19/06 22:48:36] <DannyOpsRm2> return leg at FL115 would be favourable
[GMT 03/19/06 22:48:56] <adsCockpit-c130> sounds good
[GMT 03/19/06 22:49:15] <adsCockpit-c130> will do.
[GMT 03/19/06 22:49:26] <adsCockpit-c130> that's what I thought. 11500 back.
[GMT 03/19/06 22:49:37] <adsCockpit-c130> will look at SABL and see what's happening
[GMT 03/19/06 22:49:40] <RahulZaveri-veracruz> yes
[GMT 03/19/06 22:51:18] <DannyOpsRm2> Suggest decending to FL105 as soon as safe to do so

[GMT 03/19/06 23:51:39] <NOxyO3_C130> they're ostensibly 8 hour flights, and i don't think we have fuel to go past that

[GMT 03/19/06 23:53:29] <NOxyO3_C130> so chris, sometime between 1930 and 2030
[GMT 03/19/06 23:53:47] <adsCockpit-c130> OK we're back
[GMT 03/19/06 23:54:00] <adsCockpit-c130> we had to turn S for fuel
