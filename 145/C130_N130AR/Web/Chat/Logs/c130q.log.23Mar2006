[GMT 03/23/06 19:16:33] <laptop-c130> Chris - short version is that the front injector is fine inside the inlet, I changed the O2 cylinder (will test the old one later to establish whether it was air/O2/N2), and detached MFC 10 from the "NO mix in" assembly. One of the above did the trick apparently. We finally got rid of the anti-RO2...
[GMT 03/23/06 19:17:21] <ChrisCantrell> That's great.  I'm thinking we need to have an O2 sensor to detect these kind of problems.  I'll check into it.

[GMT 03/23/06 19:34:32] <Sam_Hall> Thanks John.  The date problem is a result of a faulty IRIG signal that normally only occurs when the aircraft first powers on and the satellites are being acquired to set the clock.
[GMT 03/23/06 19:34:45] <Sam_Hall> Greg... Is it possible that the IRIG generator power was cycled during the work on ADS and/or DMS?  Thanks.

[GMT 03/23/06 19:46:49] <Jcowan-Hotel> The Irig is generated by the AFT DSM so each time the DSM's are cycled so it the Irig-b.  The last time that was done prior to flight was about 10 minutes before APU start. This is normal since we turn the DSM's off during the switchover before each flight.
[GMT 03/23/06 19:47:22] <Jcowan-Hotel> There were more on/off cycles during preflight then normal and it could have been one of them that messed up the date.

[GMT 03/23/06 21:07:20] <DataSystem-c130> What are the winds
[GMT 03/23/06 21:07:27] <AlSchanot-ops> we will have a no fly maintenance day prior to the next flight, so will not refuel upon return tonight.

[GMT 03/23/06 21:16:46] <DannyOpsRm1> Frank On Saturday the main flow from MCMA on Saturday will be directly East. WRF indicates that Friday emission (for which you will have no T0 info)
[GMT 03/23/06 21:16:53] <DannyOpsRm1> will be over the gulf.
[GMT 03/23/06 21:17:17] <DannyOpsRm1> Closer to MCMC one could encounter Sat pollution outflow.
[GMT 03/23/06 21:17:40] <DannyOpsRm1> However, the is a risk of significant convective activity in the same area.
[GMT 03/23/06 21:18:04] <adsCockpit-c130> and the longer term?
[GMT 03/23/06 21:18:19] <adsCockpit-c130> drying out?

[GMT 03/23/06 21:23:21] <DannyOpsRm1> Sunday Looks like it will have less precip and will still have flow west to east. Monday which is very uncertain this far ahead continues with this pattern.
[GMT 03/23/06 21:24:56] <adsCockpit-c130> I would think then we should call maint tomorrow, hard down on Saturday, and flight planned for Sunday
