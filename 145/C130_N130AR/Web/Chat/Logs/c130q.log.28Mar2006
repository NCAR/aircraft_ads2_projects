[GMT 03/28/06 14:46:53] <adsCockpit-c130> That depends how you look at it. We were supposed to hit WE20 at 14:36
[GMT 03/28/06 14:47:25] <adsCockpit-c130> We are therefore 20 min behind. However, since legs are now 90 miles each instead of 120 we will save 5 min each time and will b e 5 min late at profile point

[GMT 03/28/06 16:21:28] <DannyOpsRm2> Frank if you do do the east west leg please request the B200 to follow you
[GMT 03/28/06 16:22:10] <DannyOpsRm2> Still no recent update will keep checking
[GMT 03/28/06 16:23:56] <DannyOpsRm2> Frank please relay to the B200 that they should stay above the C-130 for both the spiral up and the Spiral down.
