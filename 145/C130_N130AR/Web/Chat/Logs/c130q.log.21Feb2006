[GMT 02/21/06 22:18:19] <DataSystem> dave's not feeling very well, don't think he likes the 130...Bill

[GMT 02/21/06 22:22:58] Nick change: DataSystem -> birwin-130
[GMT 02/21/06 22:24:33] <birwin-130> sent dave up to look out front wndow, he's a touch green
[GMT 02/21/06 22:25:06] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Bill, Kurt had asked how the radar alt head was functioing?
[GMT 02/21/06 22:26:23] <birwin-130> it's not, cycles back and forth fail to correct altitude
[GMT 02/21/06 22:26:45] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Thankls I'll let him know.
[GMT 02/21/06 22:28:20] <Jcowan-Jeffco> He is puzzled by that.
[GMT 02/21/06 22:33:06] <birwin-130> eta about 45 or so, depending on what they find at the top of the spiral climb
[GMT 02/21/06 22:33:54] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Okay I will pass that on.
[GMT 02/21/06 22:36:34] <birwin-130> we will want ground power after landing, on the tarmac for about 20 minutes or so before we go into barn
[GMT 02/21/06 22:39:58] <birwin-130> hey radar altimeter just started working...it's looking good the past 5 minutes
[GMT 02/21/06 22:40:15] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Okay, your users onboard understand that there will be a bump when the power transfers!!!
[GMT 02/21/06 22:40:50] <Jcowan-Jeffco> What did you do to it (the radar atlimeter that is).
[GMT 02/21/06 22:43:31] <birwin-130> understand power bump...slapped radar altimeter around some...didn't do anything it just started working at 2241Z , ooops just went back
[GMT 02/21/06 22:44:23] <birwin-130> on level flight it seemed to work, we started a spiral climb and now it's going nuts again
[GMT 02/21/06 22:45:36] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Great, I'm sure that Kurt will like that diagnoses.
[GMT 02/21/06 22:46:12] <Jcowan-Jeffco> How high are you going on the spiral?
[GMT 02/21/06 22:52:14] <birwin-130> we're done and headed home
[GMT 02/21/06 22:52:32] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Okay still lloking at 30 min ETA?
