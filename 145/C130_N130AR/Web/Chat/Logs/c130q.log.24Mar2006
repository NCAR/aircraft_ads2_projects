[GMT 03/24/06 20:27:07] <AlSchanot-ops> Hi C-130. My guess is you are out of minutes
[GMT 03/24/06 20:27:33] <AlSchanot-ops> You need to purchase a TELCEL card and refresh the minutes
[GMT 03/24/06 20:27:34] <DataSystem-c130> \Hey Al, There is power on the Islle rack >(foward left). Do we need to worry about that for shutdown?\
[GMT 03/24/06 20:28:01] <AlSchanot-ops> No on the Eisele rack.  It always looks like that at power down
[GMT 03/24/06 20:28:14] <DataSystem-c130> We are gessing that we are out also.  Both Tech and Mech phones come up with some message when we try and dial.
[GMT 03/24/06 20:28:39] <AlSchanot-ops> They have cards here at the hotel gift shop
[GMT 03/24/06 20:29:07] <AlSchanot-ops> I'd only get a 100 Peso card for now.  You guys don't go thru the minutes like I do.
[GMT 03/24/06 20:29:31] <DataSystem-c130> Okay, Okay, we will get the cards when we get back. Are they toughto install the minutes?
[GMT 03/24/06 20:29:35] <AlSchanot-ops> See me when you get back and I'll show you how it works
[GMT 03/24/06 20:30:15] <AlSchanot-ops> It's an autokmatic deal where you dial in and enter the number on the card
[GMT 03/24/06 20:30:23] <DataSystem-c130> Okay we will do that then.
[GMT 03/24/06 20:31:00] <DataSystem-c130> Okay, I was going to run the datas feed until about 1530 to make it is staying up okay.
[GMT 03/24/06 20:31:23] <AlSchanot-ops> Any Users still out there?
[GMT 03/24/06 20:32:26] <DataSystem-c130> Yes there are still 3 groups here, right front, right #3 and last left.
[GMT 03/24/06 20:32:39] <DataSystem-c130> Do you know any planes for the next couple of days?

[GMT 03/24/06 20:34:52] <AlSchanot-ops> Did you guys get a partial load of fuel on?
[GMT 03/24/06 20:35:16] <DataSystem-c130> Okay, thanks for the help.  We should be closing up on time I would guess at this point unless you know something I don't.
[GMT 03/24/06 20:35:49] <DataSystem-c130> We did put a patial load on. we have about 32000 onboard.

[GMT 03/24/06 20:46:14] <DataSystem-c130> I'll ask?\

[GMT 03/24/06 20:47:22] <AlSchanot-ops> Tell them they are going to miss the good duty free shops in Mexico City!
[GMT 03/24/06 20:47:26] <DataSystem-c130> Do we have to contact Shannon before the day we leave?  I also have a return ticket.
[GMT 03/24/06 20:47:43] <AlSchanot-ops> Yes
[GMT 03/24/06 20:47:56] <DataSystem-c130> I'll pass that on to them although I do not think it is a concern <g>.
[GMT 03/24/06 20:48:33] <DataSystem-c130> Okay then I guess we need to let her know right away or wait in case something should happen?\
[GMT 03/24/06 20:48:35] <AlSchanot-ops> Cusack was also supposed to return commercially, but we got a return on his ticket 
[GMT 03/24/06 20:49:01] <AlSchanot-ops> email on Monday will be fine
[GMT 03/24/06 20:49:31] <DataSystem-c130> Okay, then we will get a list of RAF stoff together and e-mail her on Monday.
[GMT 03/24/06 20:49:31] <AlSchanot-ops> who do you think i'd give your seats to?
[GMT 03/24/06 20:50:24] <AlSchanot-ops> I am running out of space so don't cancel everybody scheduled commercial
[GMT 03/24/06 20:50:59] <DataSystem-c130> Well mine was set since I'm the tech for the return.  The others were a question.  Are there any other seats left?
[GMT 03/24/06 20:51:26] <AlSchanot-ops> We'll talk off line
[GMT 03/24/06 20:51:37] <DataSystem-c130> No that is why we were asking you WHO was going to fly back how.
[GMT 03/24/06 20:51:40] <DataSystem-c130> Okay.

[GMT 03/24/06 21:07:10] <MikeDaniels-veracruz> John, how do you know there were no dropouts?
[GMT 03/24/06 21:07:57] <MikeDaniels-veracruz> the ones i saw just fixed themselves and unless you were watching the iridium window you would not have noticed
[GMT 03/24/06 21:08:28] <DataSystem-c130> I have not had any chat dropouts, nor seen any c130 computer have a chat drop out.
[GMT 03/24/06 21:08:47] <MikeDaniels-veracruz> you may not see it in chat, however
[GMT 03/24/06 21:09:04] <MikeDaniels-veracruz> in /var/log/messages though you will see it but you need to be root to see that
[GMT 03/24/06 21:09:07] <DataSystem-c130> Usually unless the iridum is very qiuck at least 1 chat client will dropn won't they?
[GMT 03/24/06 21:09:28] <MikeDaniels-veracruz> i don't think that is guaranteed
[GMT 03/24/06 21:09:41] <DataSystem-c130> Well I guess I was just saying that chat seems to be staying up well then instead.
[GMT 03/24/06 21:09:42] <MikeDaniels-veracruz> the most reliable way to check is by looking at the log file i mentioned above
[GMT 03/24/06 21:09:46] <MikeDaniels-veracruz> ok
[GMT 03/24/06 21:10:21] <DataSystem-c130> Will be up about another 30 min or so, then shutting down for the day.
[GMT 03/24/06 21:10:53] <MikeDaniels-veracruz> ok, glad to hear everything is working now
[GMT 03/24/06 21:11:20] <DataSystem-c130> It appears to be.  The next flight will be the real test.
