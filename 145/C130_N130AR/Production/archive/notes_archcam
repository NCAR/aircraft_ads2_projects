Possible ways to do a list of flights automatically:
----------------------------------------------------

Disable time-set option and always process all available files.

Move time-segment flags from command line to each flight (or abandon the
option when doing the list) or just ignore them and do all available files.

Abandon setting things within the script via command-line options.  Instead,
create a list file with all needed flags and alter the script to read flight
processing info from it (equivalent to the command-line options but separated
for each flight). 

Move source directory, source subdirectory and MSS subdirectory from hard-wired
entries within the script to the command line.  Then, write a script with
command lines which fully specify each flight correctly.  Execute that script.
(This looks like the best option to me.)

-------

In any case, instead of echoing job status to the terminal, write them into
a log file.  When that is the case, it eliminates the manual transfers I've
had to do to document all the archiving.  (It would be a great idea to do
that with all my archive scripts.)

Composed one version that hardwires a list of source and destination paths
for a number of flights then uses a "foreach" loop to process all of them.
Problem with this one is that it still requires hand-editing the script
file itself.  I also changed the script to echo its progress to a file
instead of to the xterm screen when in Production mode.  This helps ease
the documentation, since I don't have to manually transfer stuff from the
screen to a file.

Composed a new version to process one flight at a time.  This allows another
script to call this one with customized command-line arguments for better
automation.  Output also is written to a log file instead of to the screen
when in "Production" (not test) mode.
