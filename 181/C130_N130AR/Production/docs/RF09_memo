To all,

On 27 March 2002, Dave Leon (U Wyoming) made RAF aware of a time offset in the
high-rate netCDF file for DYCOMS-II RF09 (07/27/2001) when compared with its
companion low-rate file.

Upon investigating this problem, I discovered that the processing program
failed to keep track of correct time following an approximate 12-minute data
gap which occurred just as the airplane was taking off.  At 18:47 UTC the
high-rate data were 22 seconds ahead.  Later at 19:00 UTC, the difference
widened to 11m 34s and stayed there for the rest of the flight.  By looking
at the independent time measurements (HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND) it became obvious
that the high-rate data file had the error.

To correct the problem, I reprocessed the high-rate data for RF09 by omitting
the initial 45-minute segment that occurred before takeoff.  The new data file
has the correct time information.

I removed the errant file from the RAF archive and replaced it with the new
file which has a different name due its new time period.  Its SCD Mass Store
bitfile names are (one plain, one gzipped):
 /ATD/DATA/2001/DYCOMS-II/C130_N130AR/HRT/RF09.20010727.191201_034427.PNI.nc
 /ATD/DATA/2001/DYCOMS-II/C130_N130AR/HRT/RF09.20010727.191201_034427.PNI.nc.gz

I urge anyone presently using high-rate data from RF09 (07/27/2001) to get
the new file.  Use the web URL:

All the documentation on the RAF DYCOMS-II web site has been updated to
reflect this change:

RAF apologizes for this discrepancy and sincerely thanks Dave Leon for
pointing it out to us.
