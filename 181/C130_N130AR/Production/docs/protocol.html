<h2><font face="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica"> DYCOMS-II: Data
</font></h2>

<br>

<blockquote>

DYCOMS-II has been formulated as a collaborative experiment designed
to collect a high-quality data set capable of meeting the scientific
goals of its science team, and also of providing for the needs of a
broader community.  Toward this end DYCOMS PIs have adopted the following
data policy.

<dl>
  <dt><em><strong>Initial Access </strong> </strong></em></dt>
  <dd> Access to the data archive, which shall include all data collected
using RAF instrumentation and or data-loggers, will be limited to the
science team (i.e., experiment participants who agree to the DYCOMS II
data policy) and its designates during the first year after the data
is made ready for release.  Note that this is somewhat later than one
year after the experiment.  This is to insure that the science team is
given the possibility of meeting its contractual obligations
(scientific goals). </dd>
  <dt><em><strong>Guidelines for Data Publication During First Year </strong> </strong></em></dt>
  <dd> Publications prepared during this first year of restricted access
will be subject to internal review by the members of the science team.
This is to prevent accidental mischaracterizations or misuse of the
data/and or experiment.  It also provides a means for resolving
priority claims before papers are submitted.
  </dd>
  <dt><em><strong>Archiving Data </strong> </strong></em></dt>
  <dd> Unless specific arrangements are made with the science team before
hand, or data quality issues so dictate, data collected by
investigators flying their own instruments will be incorporated into
the archive, and made available to the science team during the
prerelease period.
</dd> 
  <dt><em><strong>Collaboration Guidelines </strong> </strong></em></dt>
  <dd> Publications that are written during the year of restricted access
and which incorporate data from individually supported instruments
shall be subject to approval of the PI whose instrument's data is
being analyzed.  Ideally such papers will develop in a collaborative
fashion. </dd>
  <dt><em><strong>Public Access </strong> </strong></em></dt>
  <dd> Every effort will be made to make sure that the publically released
data archive is widely advertised to the community and readily
available to all interested parties.  As time and resources permit,
efforts will be made to blend this archive with historical archives,
such as DYCOMS-I, FIRE and ASTEX. </dd>
</dl>
