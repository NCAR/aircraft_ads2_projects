#  Archive RDMA (and Bandy) data files for 2001-181 DYCOMS-II
#   Rename RDMA files to reflect the fact that they are raw
#goto rename
#
#  Advisory:
#   RDMA data are extracted from the ADS data set by the "nimbus" software.
#   For meaningful production processing of these data, other state parameter
#   measurements are required, so there is no need for these data to stand
#   alone.  Therefore, the separate RAW_RDMA files have been removed today
#   from the SCD Mass Store System archive via the script:
#       /jnet/shared/proj/archives/MSS_updates/remove_RDMA
