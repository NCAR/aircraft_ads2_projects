#  Archive stripped raw PMS-2D data files for 2001-181 DYCOMS-II
goto purge
#
#  Note:  Because these files also were archived to the new /ATD/DATA
#          path by the script "atdarch2d.181," there is no reason to
#          keep two copies.  Therefore, the files archived by this
#          script were removed by the "msssearch decision support tool,
#          Alpha Release" on Mon Mar 24, 2003 sometime before 15:03:45 MST.
