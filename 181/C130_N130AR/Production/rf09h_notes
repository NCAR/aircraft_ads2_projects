Email messages in Mail.181 should document the situation with RF09.  Dave
Leon (U Wyoming) made me aware of a time offset between high- and low-rate
data sets.

The time offset is apparently associated with a large time gap and two ADS
files.  The first segment, about 45 minutes long, all has on-the-ground data.
The second, comprising the rest of the flight, starts after takeoff.

RF09 HRT was reprocessed on 28 March 2002 using the same version of NIMBUS
used in the original HRT processing, so no new nimbus processor code needs
to be archived to the SCD Mass Store System (MSS).

Now that I have reprocessed RF09, here are the steps needed to update all the
documentation:

+ Check flight data
   Comment from flight log:  IRS problem after 00:16 UTC -- IRS data omitted
   from file after this time.  (This was never implemented in either LRT or
   HRT data set.)

+ MSS archive RF09 HRT to both /ATD and /RAF data paths
  + arch.181
  + atdarch.181
+ MSS archive RF09 HRT gzipped to /ATD data path
  + atdarchz.181

+ remove bad MSS RF09 HRT bitfiles from /ATD data path

- update web site:
  + data_summary.html
  + /net/www/docs/raf/projects/DYCOMS-II/Production/taplog.hrt.181
  + l_taplog/taplog.hrt.181
  + FltMatrix.html (not necessary, since it uses LRT times)
  + docsum.html
    + annotate problem with RF09 HRT
  + changes.html
    + add all html files mentioned above

+ compose and send email to all DYCOMS-II participants

+ update affected documentation files
  + tapes.181
  + msfiles/msls.181
  + tarit.181 - update then run
    + logFile_HRT.rf09.old
    + taplog.hrt.181
    + rf09h_notes
  + tarit.docs - run when documents are ready
    + RF09_memo
  + archive.support - update then run
    + 181.documents.tar
    + 181.documents.tar.dir
    + 181.tar
    + 181.tar.dir
    + Mail.181
    + taplog.hrt.181 (two places)
    + tapes.181
 
+ All steps completed by 1:40 p.m. on 29 March 2002
