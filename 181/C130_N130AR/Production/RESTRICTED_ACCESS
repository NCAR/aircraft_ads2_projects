The DYCOMS-II PI team, in a letter dated 23 February 2001, requested
resticted access to the data acquired by this project.  In an email
from Brigitte Baeuerle dated 14 March 2001, this request was granted.
(See the message saved in the file Mail.181.)

Accordingly, all raw and processed data archived to the SCD Mass Store System
(MSS) will be protected with a READ password in addition to the normal WRITE
password.  Such protection will remain in place for a period of one year after
the production data set has been officially released.

The READ password is DYCONLY.

This action will have an impact on anyone needing to access these data from
the MSS, including those doing the quick-look and production processing.
Local copies of raw and production data files perhaps should be protected
with "owner-only" permissions, and ownership may be assigned to the "nimbus"
login.  (This procedure will have to be worked out.)

I plan to modify my "msget" scripts (or create a special new set) to include
a READ password option.  Otherwise, data requests using these scripts will
fail.

As of 7 August 2001, the scripts msgetads, Msgetads, msgetcdf and Msgetcdf
have been enhanced to handle READ password-protected bitfiles for this
project.  Other scripts in the enhancement queue are msget2d and msgetmcr.

Today the preliminary netCDF files for this project are being archived to
the MSS in the directory /RAF/2001/181/LRT/PRELIMINARY/ protected by the
same password pair.

I am setting up a web page on the atd server (http:www.atd.ucar.edu) to
allow restricted access to DYCOMS-II Mass Store bitfiles.  It will have
the following:
    user name:  dycoms
    password:   data2001
Other user name/password pairs can be added later, if needed.

As of today, all the Preliminary LRT netCDF data have been archived to the MSS.
They also have been protected with the DYCOMS-II read and write passwords.

As of today, the Ultra High Rate (UHRT) netCDF files have been archived to
the MSS.  They also have been protected with the DYCOMS-II read and write
passwords.

The stripped, raw PMS-2D data have been archived to the SCD Mass Store System
in the directory:
   /ATD/DATA/2001/DYCOMS-II/C130_N130AR/PMS2D/
They also have been protected with the DYCOMS-II read and write passwords.

As of today, the Low Rate (LRT) netCDF files have been archived to the MSS.
They also have been protected with the DYCOMS-II read and write passwords.

As of today, the High Rate (HRT) netCDF files have been archived to the MSS.
They also have been protected with the DYCOMS-II read and write passwords.

As of today, a shorter version of the Ultra High Rate (UHRT) netCDF files have
been archived to the MSS.  (These were done primarily for Hermann Gerber.)
They also have been protected with the DYCOMS-II read and write passwords.

As of today, a gzipped version of the shorter Ultra High Rate (UHRT) netCDF
files have been archived to the MSS.
They also have been protected with the DYCOMS-II read and write passwords.

A revised version of LRT RF01 was archived to the MSS.
It also has been protected with the DYCOMS-II read and write passwords.

The final production data files (LRT, HRT, UHRT) have been archived to
the MSS in the directories
   /RAF/2001/181/
     and
   /ATD/DATA/2001/DYCOMS-II/C130_N130AR/
The latter directory is set up for outside password-protected access.
All files have both read and write passwords.  These will be in effect
for one year following their official release date:  10 January 2002.

Every bitfile for DYCOMS-II archived to the SCD Mass Store System currently
is protected with a read password.  On 10 January 2003 the restriction will
end, and all files will be released to the public.  This can be accomplished
with two "mspasswd" commands:
    mspasswd -R -wpwd WRITE_PASSWORD -rpwd READ_PASSWORD -newr OFF /ATD/DATA/2001/DYCOMS-II/C130_N130AR
    mspasswd -R -wpwd WRITE_PASSWORD -rpwd READ_PASSWORD -newr OFF /RAF/2001/181

The next step is to modify the web pages for public access and inform the
DYCOMS-II email list that the data have been released.

Affected pages are:
* changes.html (obvious)
* docsum.html (boiler plate, revise "Data Download" and "Data Logs" section
  FltMatrix.html (redo "Get Data")
* QA.html (#22.  2D C probe--no registration needed)
* taplog.mcr.181.html
* taplog.lrt.181.html [SCD Mass Store System Production Output netCDF Files (Low Rate)]
* taplog.hrt.181.html
* taplog.uhrt.181.html
* taplog.pms2d.181.html

Unaffected pages are:
  data_summary.html
  dycoms2links.html
  F_Reports.html
  index.html
  inst.html
  iru_perf.html
  photos.html
  piping.html
  register_user.html (eliminate)
  varlist.hrt.html
  varlist.lrt.html
  varlist.uhrt.html
  video_log.html
