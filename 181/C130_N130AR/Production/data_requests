Ron,

I've received two emails this week indicating people have
downloaded DYCOMS-II files. The requestors were

	takahi@uwyo.edu
	thompson@nrlmry.navy.mil

If you want to get the emails instead, add these lines to
the archive description in dycoms-ii.xml:

	<archive
            ...
 	  emailCCAddr="ruth@ucar.edu"
	  emailFromAddr="ruth@ucar.edu"
        />

The emailCCAddr attribute is who will receive CCs of emails
that are sent when a request has been copied from the mass store.

The emails will appear to come from whomever is set as the
emailFromAddr.  When an error occurs, users are advised to
complain to that person.

By default, both attributes default to the values specified
in atdModel.xml, in the <mssFetcher> tag.  Currently those
are set to my email address.

Gordon

Ron:

    Thanks kindly for making and sending that CD. I had already tried with
Krita's help to ftp some data from DYCOMS, but my Windows FTP software
couldn't deal with it. I'll have to figure out a way to do it, because I'm
also making a substantial effort to be compatible with net.cdf files and
some of your nice software such as NCPLOT.

    I have registered to permit access to the preliminary DYCOMS data, and
will make some more attempts to transfer some files.

    I have one more question about the DYCOMS data: I noticed that the
master list of variables recorded by the C-130 data system does not include
the size distribitions measured by your PMS probes (FSSP-100, 260X, 2-DC).
Will the size distributions measured by these probes be available? Where and
when?

Regards,
Herm

Herm,

You're welcome.  The CD with RF08 and RF09 went out this afternoon via
FedEx overnight, so you should get it before noon tomorrow.

>

I saw that, because I get an email message from everyone who registers.

The preliminary netCDF files for DYCOMS-II do include size distributions for
the 1-D probes.  The measurement names are:

   AS100_LPI(Time, sps1, Vector41) -- FSSP-100 Raw Accumulation (per cell)-DMT
   AS200_RPO(Time, sps1, Vector31) -- PCAS Raw Accumulation (per cell)-DMT
   A260X_RWO(Time, sps1, Vector64) -- 260X Raw Accumulation (per cell)
   AS300_RPC(Time, sps1, Vector31) -- FSSP-300 Raw Accumulation (per cell)-DMT

   CS100_LPI(Time, sps1, Vector41) -- FSSP-100 Concentration (per cell)-DMT
   CS200_RPO(Time, sps1, Vector31) -- PCAS Concentration (per cell)-DMT
   C260X_RWO(Time, sps1, Vector64) -- 260X Concentration (per cell)
   CS100_LPI(Time, sps1, Vector41) -- FSSP-100 Concentration (per cell)-DMT
   CS300_RPC(Time, sps1, Vector31) -- FSSP-300 Concentration (per cell)-DMT

   CONC3_RPC(Time) -- FSSP-300 Concentration (all cells)
   CONC6_RWO(Time) -- 260X Concentration (all cells)
   CONCF_LPI(Time) -- FSSP-100 Concentration (all cells)
   CONCP_RPO(Time) -- PCAS Concentration (all cells)

The 2-Ds are more problematic, since they require post-processing to obtain
size distributions.  I'm not sure if we'll have them before we do production
processing.  You may want to contact Krista Laursen (krista@ucar.edu,
(303)497-1031) about that.

I'm not sure whether Chris Webster is working on a Windows version of ncplot.
It does run under Solaris and Linux, and I think SGI's version of UNIX.
Though I despise Micro$oft, I still think it would be beneficial for our
utilities to run under those OS versions (98, Me, NT, 2000, XP, etc.).
I have a dual-boot computer at home with NT and RedHat Linux.  That way
I can cover both bases.

I'll have to try using NT's ftp to get some files from our site.  It would
be nice to know whether large files are the problem or whether it's something
else.  I've had success transferring modest files using Netscape version 4.7x.

Dear Lan,

There is only one login name and password pair associated with access to
the DYCOMS-II data.  Since you are working with Dr. Kogan, I can give you
this information.  Please be aware that, as of now, only the preliminary
data are available.  Use these data with care and avoid doing any critical
research until the final production data set is available (expected in mid
November 2001.)

Also, in case you have not seen it, please read the DYCOMS-II Data Protocol
page. It has been posted by the Principal Investigators who assume that you
agree to the statements made there before requesting any data from this site.
It is available at the URL:
     http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/~bstevens/dycoms/data.html

The DYCOMS-II data access page is:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/DYCOMS-II/data_request.html
     login:  dycoms
  password:  data2001

If you have any problems retrieving these data or need other help,
please let me know.

Sincerely, 

Ron

Dear Qing,

Great to hear from you again.  How are things going?

Well, you are on Bjorn Stevens' email list, so you definitely may have the
login and password.  You should have gotten something from Bjorn about a
month ago.

Dear Qing,

Things have been going well here, too.  Our C-130 is presently in Mexico
on the EPIC project.  Lately the aircraft systems seem to have been
working quite well.  There is a sampling problem with the data system
which, hopefully, will get fixed after the project.  We can take out
the bad data points it creates with a "temporary" despike routine in
the processing program.  I wish all were clean, though.

Security here at NCAR is still rather loose.  Here at Jeffco things are
"business as usual."  Sometimes I think it may help to have things tightened
down a bit more than they are.

I've remained busy with RAF's web site and data processing, archiving and
distribution.  It keeps me busy.  The ACE-Asia web site is up, and I'm
soon going to be finishing up the DYCOMS-II site.

Hard to believe how fast the time is flying by.  October already!!

Ron

Hi Ron,

I'm currently processing the Fast-FSSP data from DYCOMS-II.
In order to check our measurements, I would like to look at
some spectra from the FSSP-100. Could you make such low rate
data available to me ?

regards,
Fred.

Dear Fred,

We have not yet released the final production data for DYCOMS-II, but
you are welcome to retrieve our preliminary low-rate netCDF data files.
Use the web URL:
     http://www.atd.ucar.edu/raf/projects/DYCOMS-II/
This will take you to a series registration pages.  Once complete, you
can click on a data retrieval link.  It will ask you for a login and
password.  They are:
        login:  dycoms
     password:  data2001

After that you can view a list of files available and order what you want.
If you have any problems, please let me know.

P.S.  We hope to release the final data before the end of November.

Ron

Ron:

I'm trying to get some DYCOMS netcdf files to our machine at Oregon State,
but I'm working at home on my PC and they're taking 2.5 hours each to ftp
(and then I have to ftp them to OSU!). Would you mind ftp-ing them directly
to the incoming directory at oce.orst.edu via anonymous ftp?

I have requested the files and they're already on the RAF ftp site, DYCOMS
LRT R3, R5, and R7.

Thanks for the help.

Ron:

I was able to transfer a small file to the incoming directory. Your files
are listed but with 0 file size. I wonder if the files are too big? Maybe
you could try gzipping R3 (the one I really need) and sending again. In the
meantime, I'll continue to go by snail speed.

Thanks much,
Cindy

Cindy,

I just got an email copy where you requested RF05, RF07 and RF08.  How about
if I copy all 4 files.

Cindy,

I logged in and tried to transfer all the files.  Here is an example of
the dialog between your ftp server and one of my transfer attempts.

ftp> bi
200 Type set to I.
ftp> put RF07.20010724.055322_154919.PNI.nc
200 PORT command successful.
425 Can't build data connection: Operation already in progress.

200 PORT command successful.
425 Can't build data connection: Operation already in progress.
ftp> bye
221-You have transferred 0 bytes in 0 files.
221-Total traffic for this session was 3420 bytes in 0 transfers.
221-Thank you for using the FTP service on ftp.oce.orst.edu.
221 Goodbye.

I doubt that they were successful, since, when I exited the session it told me
that I had transferred no bytes.  The "ls" command didn't work, either.
Perhaps you can forward to me specific instructions for uploading to your
site.

FYI, I'm logged in from home.  I've been helping wife Judy who had rotator
cuff surgery last week.  This is also an NCAR holiday, but I checked in 
because of the restricted DYCOMS data set, since I'm handling all user
registration.

It may be possible for you to do this job, too.  So far as I know, you should
be able to log on to port.atd.ucar.edu using "ssh."  You'll want to change to
the directory:
     /net/ftp/pub/temp/mss/DYCOMS-II/C130_N130AR/LRT/

The files are:
   RF01.20010710.060059_151813.PNI.nc   79.383532
   RF02.20010711.062440_155235.PNI.nc  110.218020

   RF08.20010725.194522_052034.PNI.nc  111.630404

Log in to your ftp site, change to the "incoming" directory, set binary
transfers and go.

I'll check my email a bit later today.

Cindy,

Looks like I got RF03 transferred OK.  Its name on the "incoming" directory
is:
   RF03.20010713.061823_154603.PNI.nc2.gz

(One gets only one shot at a file name.  The first time I tried to transfer
it as ASCII.

I'll do the others now.

Cindy,

I finished transferring the files you requested to the "incoming" directory
on ftp.oce.orst.edu.  Apparently there is a file size limit.  Here is the
summary:
                                                File Size (MB)

Hi,
 I tried downloading the new version of the low-data-rate aircraft data
of the DYCOMS project for July 10 2001 and got an error from the JOSS
web page that this time period was not available.   Scot Loehrer
suggested that I ask you about this.

Melanie,

I may have to update JOSS, because data are available for this date.
To get DYCOMS-II aircraft data from us, you can use the URL:
   http://www.atd.ucar.edu/raf/projects/DYCOMS-II/Production/data_download.html

If you still have a problem, contact me again.

Ron,

Thank you for your reply. I retrieved production flight-level low-rate aircraft
data (unzipped) directly from Web site, right-mouse clicking and saving on my
local disc. I attempted to open files for research flights 1 to 10.

Regards,

Tomasz

Tomasz,

If you are still not able to read the files, I'm not sure how to proceed.
Which web browser did you use to retrieve the files?  What kind of computer
system are you using?  (Please give me as much information and be as specific
as you can.)

If you've been able to read other netCDF files, there really should be no
difference with ours (other than data content).

How about also giving me your RAF netCDF file list including byte size.

Ron

Hermann,

I copied the files to jeffco's ftp server.  You should now be able to pick
up RF01 through RF04.  You have two ways:
  browser URL:
        ftp://raf.atd.ucar.edu/pub/projects/DYCOMS-II/RF01.20010710.060111_151725.PNI.nc.gz

The data files available at this site are compressed using the GZIP format.
Once transferred to your site, these files can be uncompressed using the
utility "gunzip," the Windows utility "WinZip" or Aladdin Systems' "Expander."

gzip/gunzip (freeware) is available at the URL: 
     http://www.gzip.org/ 

WinZip (shareware) can be downloaded from the URL: 
     http://www.winzip.com/ 

Expander (freeware version) is available at the URL: 
     http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/ 

Please let me know how this worked for you.

Ron,
Thanks for your help and message. I've tried to use the browser URL and find
that the flights labeled RF02, RF03, RF04 all read RF01 when an attempt is
made to download them. In other words they're all the same file, RF01.

Hermann

Hi Ron,

About two hrs. ago I pulled the RF03 HRT (25 Hz) data file off the DYCOMS
Web page. Why it decided to behave that time I have no idea.

Tomorrow morning I'll try to download the other HRT files.

Thanks for your help!

Hermann

Hermann,

Well, that's really strange.  With Linux, you should be able to  use the
second method:

  ftp:
       site:  raf.atd.ucar.edu
 login name:  anonymous
   password:  <your full email address>
         df:  BI (binary)
       mode:  passive
     format:  gzipped netCDF
       path:  pub/projects/DYCOMS-II/                    Size (MB)
      files:  RF01.20010710.060111_151725.PNI.nc.gz      214.301161
              RF02.20010711.062452_155147.PNI.nc.gz      224.350187
              RF03.20010713.061835_154515.PNI.nc.gz      232.545374
              RF04.20010717.062250_153042.PNI.nc.gz      215.185647

On our system, the files are unique and definitely of different size.

If you've never used this ftp method, here's a string of commands to try
from an Xterm window assuming that you are connected to the net:

   ftp raf.atd.ucar.edu
     (enter login name and password at the prompts)
   cd pub/projects/DYCOMS-II
   bi
   get RF03.20010713.061835_154515.PNI.nc.gz
   get RF01.20010710.060111_151725.PNI.nc.gz
   get RF02.20010711.062452_155147.PNI.nc.gz
   get RF04.20010717.062250_153042.PNI.nc.gz
   bye

I've eliminated any output from the ftp server to you, but they should be
mostly acknowledgements and prompts.  As a second argument to the "get"
command, you can specify a local file name.  I'm wondering whether you may
have gotten tripped up with all the <period> characters in the file names.
You could use something like:
  get RF03.20010713.061835_154515.PNI.nc.gz RF03_nc.gz

See if that works for you.

Hermann,

Thanks for your phone message.  Perhaps it would help if I renamed the files
on my end to something shorter.  Try it again.  The new file names (same path):
         pub/projects/DYCOMS-II/     Size (MB)
               RF01_HRT.gz          214.301161
               RF02_HRT.gz          224.350187
               RF03_HRT.gz          232.545374
               RF04_HRT.gz          215.185647

If that doesn't work, I'll try putting each file in a separate directory.

Hermann,

On Windows NT (which I have at home) there is an "ftp" application:
  C:\WINNT\system32\FTP.EXE
I would expect you can find a version on your Micro$osft operating system
somewhere.

Hi Ron,

no the total size of the g-zipped files was only ~1.5 Gb, so I'm not sure
why I didn't get them.  I was waiting and waiting last night and was curious
because I never got any automated word that there was a problem.  I used the
automated web page (http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/mss_retrieval/) to try to get
these.  Should I instead use Msgetcdf?  Thanks,

If....

This was resolved.  Ian was trying to use the ATD Data Retrieval web site
for DYCOMS-II data files which are protected by read passwords.  He must
use the DYCOMS-II data retrieval web page instead.

Hello Ron,

I am uncertain about how to obtain 2D data for the DYCOMS flights.  
Please let me know where these might be found, or what sort of request I 
need to make.

Thanks   -  Gabor

Gabor,

All the available DYCOMS-II data can be retrieved via RAF's DYCOMS-II web site:
   http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/DYCOMS-II/docsum.html

When requesting data, you will be pointed to the following URL:
   Data Download Site for Registered Users
   http://www.atd.ucar.edu/raf/projects/DYCOMS-II/Production/data_download.html

It is protected (due to the data restriction), so you need to "log in" using
the following:
     User ID:  dycoms
    Password:  data2001

If you have any problems, please let me know.  We're trying to make this
procedure as easy as possible for our users.

Ron

Patrick,

Access to RAF's aircraft data is via our web site:
  http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/DYCOMS-II/

The data-access page is via our  registered-users' download page:
  http://www.atd.ucar.edu/raf/projects/DYCOMS-II/Production/data_download.html

Since this is a restricted data set, access is granted via:
   User ID:  dycoms
  Password:  data2001

If you have any problems, please let me know.  We're trying to make this
procedure as easy as possible for our users.  (Note:  I will be out of town
in Norman, OK with the IHOP project from 16-27 May 2002, but I'm hoping to
be in touch with my email.)

Ron

Hi Ron,

I'm trying to access the high-rate data from DYCOMS-II, but am unable to use
your Msgetads script because a.) I don't have a migs account and/or b.) I do not
know the read password for the ADS files apparently (I tried the dycoms project
password.)  I need to strip out the original high rate ozone data from variables
XFO3*.  The other variables I need I can get from extant final production netCDF
files, but this original data is nowhere to be found except in the original ADS
files.  Can you recommend what I can do to get access to these data?  Thanks
again for your time,

If.......

Ian,

Because the DYCOMS-II data set is restricted, a different procedure is needed
to access the files.  Go the URL:
   http://www.atd.ucar.edu/raf/projects/DYCOMS-II/Production/data_download.html

You will be asked for:
      UserID:  dycoms
    Password:  data2001

After that you will be taken to an information page which allows you to
display available files by category.  (You wanted HRT.)  The "Request Files"
button at the bottom takes you to the file-select page where you can specify
the files you want.  They will be downloaded for you from the Mass Store
if they are not already in ATD's ftp download area.  You can retrieve the
files via links in the page.  It should be clear on how to proceed, but if
you have any problem, please let me know.

Ron

    Dear Ron,
    Thanks for your quick answer. However I still cannont download the 
data. I can see a list of available data, but  the 'request files' gives 
no answer? Am I doing something wrong?

Dear Hanna,

I just accessed the download page via the "Request Files" button, and it
worked OK for me.  Sometimes, the site gets busy with other orders, so you
may just try it again later.

One point, however:  the data order section uses Java.  Do you have it
enabled for your browser?

If you are still having problems later today, please write back telling me
the browser you are using and any other information you may think is useful.

At worst, we can put the data on our ftp site, and I can give you specific
instructions for downloading it from there.  It would be best, of course,
if you can get the data directly, but I stand ready to help you, if needed.

Ian,

To get DYCOMS-II data you need to use the restricted data access portal:
   http://www.atd.ucar.edu/raf/projects/DYCOMS-II/Production/data_download.html
These data are protected until 10 January 2003.

Ron

Hi Ron -

I am the researcher at ETL that's interested in evaluating the radiative

impact of the cloud top structure of DYCOMS-II RF08. You
were cc'ed on an email from Bjorn Stevens in late July, a reply
to Graham Feingold's question to him if it would be okay for me to
work with that data (it is). So now I am at the next step, of wanting
to access the data for flight 08 and begin looking at it. The data
I would be interested in is:
-the cloud radar data (and the WYoming King Air's associated
microphysical
measurements)
-the lidar data
-the MCR (multichannel Cloud Radiometer) data

I am assuming from Bjorn's email that you are the person I should
contact towards receiving authorization to access the data netcdf files,

is that correct ? If so, can I expect the netcdf files available through

http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/DYCOMS-II/FltMatrix.html to contain
all of the data mentioned above ?

Sincerely, Paquita Zuidema

people and take it from there -

Dear Paquita,

The netCDF files at the URL you mentioned in your message above):
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/DYCOMS-II/FltMatrix.html
contain flight-level data only for our EC-130Q Hercules.

To obtain the U Wyoming KingAir data, please contact:
   Al Rodi (rodi@uwyo.edu)

To obtain the U Wyoming Wyoming Cloud Radar, please contact:
  Gabor Vali (vali@uwyo.edu)

To obtain the NCAR/RTF SABL (lidar) data, please contact:
  Bruce Morley (bruce@ucar.edu)

RAF's DYCOMS-II documentation summary page:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/DYCOMS-II/docsum.html

Since your name is not on our official list of restricted DYCOMS-II project
users, I forwarded your request early yesterday afternoon to the DYCOMS-II
Principal Investigator, Bjorn Stevens, for approval.  When he replies with a
positive response, I'll send you the login/password needed for data access.
He may want to contact you directly before then.

Ron

Hongfei,

please read the data policy page on the DYCOMS website (on my
website)... and perhaps touch base with Gabor Vali before you publish
anything with the radar data, but otherwise I see no problem.

Sorry for the delay in responding.

Bjorn

Ian,

I got this error message in my email late yesterday.  Did you get any specific
message as to exactly what the error was?  All the file names look OK to me.
I suppose it's possible that this request exceeded the 5GB limit we impose
on single data transfers.

Were you actually able to retrieve these files?

Ian,

Well, you should be able to do it either way.  I'm not sure why it failed.
You could try them one at a time to see if that works.  It also may be that,
since these are already gzipped, the default retrieval mode to gzip the files
couldn't be done a second time.  (Try turning off the gzip radio button if it
exists on the request form.)

Msgetcdf will work, too, but its local file name won't propogate the "gz"
extension even though the file will actually be gzipped.  You may want to
rename it with the .gz extent before unzipping or request the unzipped
version instead.

Ron

I know nothing about the person who applied, so I'm asking you if it's
OK to give Stefan access to the DYCOMS-II data.

I can write him again and ask him to contact you, but he already is
expecting a message directly from you.  Is it OK if you respond instead
of me?  You can ask the right questions.

If I get future DYCOMS-II registration requests, I'll just reply to the
sender asking s/he to contact you directly.  That should shorten the number
of messages we pass back and forth.

Ron,

sure I will contact him.  for the future your plan sounds fine.. although after
January 1 or so the data becomes a public archive, so this administrative task
should expire.

Cheers, Bjorn

Bjorn,

Thanks.

The actual expiration date is 10 January 2003.  I then will make the data
publicly accessible.

Matt,

you are welcome to use DYCOMS data.. however, if you want access now, we
are asking that you write a brief statement indicating intended uses to
be distributed to the science team to clear any potential conflicts of
interest.    i was snooping a bit on your web page (I guess this is not
snooping) and noticed that you are looking at drizzle/radar retreivals.
in this respect you might find it fruitful to explore possible
collaborations with a former postdoc who worked with me and is now in
Boulder for a few months.  Her name is Margreet van Zanten, and she has
been perusing the microphysical data in great detail for the past year.
Her email is attached to this letter.    It probably would also be worth
meeting with her (either her coming up to CSU or you coming down)....
also of course the U Wyoming folks in Gabor's group.

Cheers, Bjorn

	Hello Dr. Stevens...thanks for the info on the DYCOMS dataset.  I
don't know if you recall me, but I emailed you about the DYCOMS experiment
last spring, as I was finishing up my M.S. thesis.  By way of a brief
review, I used the Nicholls (1984) observations of marine stratocumulus
as a basis to test a cloud microphysics retrieval on simulated,
LES-derived cloud properties.  I'd hoped to go a bit further with the
retrieval by applying it to actual observations, and Dr. Graeme Stephens (my
advisor) suggested I try with the DYCOMS data.  I've been in contact with
Dr. Vali at Wyoming by email, and his guidance led me to the RAF DYCOMS page.
I already have DYCOMS radar data; I was looking for aircraft telemetry to
perhaps coordinate radar data with satellite observations (DMSP and such.)
I hope I was at the right place!

	As for the brief statement; I am using a new cloud microphysics
retrieval by Dr. Richard Austin (Part I is in JGR #106, 28233-28242,
Part II is still in pre-press) that's concurrent with our CloudSat research.
This retrieval uses W-band radar observations combined with cloud optical
depth measurements to produce cloud microphysical properties.  My research is
specific to drizzling and non-drizzling marine stratocumulus research.
As such, I was hoping to use radar observations and any in-situ cloud
measurements from the DYCOMS data, along with Dr. Austin's retrieval, to
further investigate the drizzling/non-drizzing properties of marine
stratocumulus clouds.  Feel free to provide my contact information to science
team members - I'd be glad to forward them a copy of my thesis, or answer any
further questions they might have about the research.

	Thank you for the information, and I look forward to working with
members of the DYCOMS team in my research.  Thanks again!

cheers,

Matt,

okay, now I remember.. anyway, especially since you have made contact with
Gabor, I don't see any problems... Ron Ruth is being cc'd on this and will help
you gain access.

Thanks, Bjorn

Dear Ron,

Thanks for the prompt service!  I thought I had previously signed up but
finally realized that I had just been mooching data from a colleague
here (Lan Yi, who has since moved on) who had access.

Dear Ron Ruth,

My name is Margreet van Zanten and the past year I have been working as
a post-doc with Bjorn Stevens at UCLA, at the moment however I am a
visitor at NCAR. I am working with the microphysical data of the
DYCOMS-II field study and would like to get the raw binary data file(s)
of the 2D-C for rf07. Until now I worked with the data in the netcdf
files but Bill Hall will have a look for me at the 2DC data and he needs
raw binary input files for his programs. The question is what is the
best way to obtain these?

Best regards,

Margreet van Zanten

P.S. I just registered for access to the RAF/ATD
registerd-users'download page

Dear Margreet,

Just so you have a written record (instead of just my phone call):
The DYCOMS-II data access page is:
  
http://www.atd.ucar.edu/raf/projects/DYCOMS-II/Production/data_download.html
     login:  dycoms
  password:  data2001

You may also find RAF's DYCOMS-II documentation summary useful:
   http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/DYCOMS-II/

If you have any problems retrieving these data or need other help, please
let me know.

Sincerely,

Ron

Dear Ron Ruth,

Thank you very much for your quick reply! As you can see from another
mail cced to you I was succesfull in downloading the two files I wanted.
Compliments for the user-friendly way data can be retrieved nowadays, I
remember needing much more complicated Mass Store System commands last
time for the DYCOMS-I data.

Best regards,

Margreet
