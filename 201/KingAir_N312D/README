Changes for processing of Hong Kong air quality data.

Changed CN counter divide to 16.

Changed the calibration pressure for Luminox NO2 to 1013

Passed the variable XLUMS straght through to XNO2C.  There is no
non linear correction on the luminol signal.

Changed DependTable for Luminox to include XLUMP

There was an unknown problem in the radar altimeter.
Special calibration coefficients were derived using
the profile from R96 as the calibration basis.
This profile started at 100 ft above sealevel, and
the voltage for HGM was reverse engineered from the
standard processing algorithm.  This voltage was then
used as a regression against PALT.  The regression 
expression is:

HGM (feet) = 264 - 29.98 * hgmv

if hgmv < -7.3 volts

HGM (feet) = -948 - 196 * hgmv

This keys to project 201 in the amlib/xlate/hgm
file.



There was a voltage offset in ADS for flights 93-96.  This
was corrected by terminating the parameter XNEPR with
a 50 ohm short, and using this as a zero reference channel.
The rec_decode.c was changed to work with this.

There are three flight groups for the production:

Flight 78, where the large chemistry pumps were not operated, 
and the calibrations for the state parameters changed slightly.


Flights 67-87, excluding flight 78.  This had a different unit for
DPB.


Flights 88-97, same as flights 67-87 change in DPB.
