All:
   Lowell Genzlinger informed me yesterday that Dianrdo has changed his plans
and wants to return with the EC-130Q to Norfolk, Virginia.  This is where the
project was supposed to operate when the EC-130Q had the engine failure.  He 
then projected to go from OKC to New Orleans to pick up the over-ocean phase;
however, they now are going back to Norfolk instead.
   The schedule, as outlined by Lowell, is to ferry to Norfolk on Thursday
from OKC.  Friday will be a down day.  Research will begin on Saturday, 7/17,
and there will be flights Saturday, Sunday, Monday with Tuesday as a back-up.
They will station the EC-130Q at Piedmont Aviation as before, and they will
be staying at the Doubletree Inn as before.
   Lowell reports that things are going well with the EC-130Q, and Dinardo
is pleased with the operation and his instrumentation.
   They hope to retrun to Jeffco on Wednesday, 7/21.
   The NASA P-3 has flown several flights in OKC and is now down with a
cracked windscreen.
   Stay tuned for the latest changes.

Via today's noon mail pickup at Jeffco I sent you the following
fourteen (14) 8mm tapes for archiving to the SCD Mass Store System:
 
     1368 through 1381
 
Please be aware that these tapes are for "read only."  Unlike ordinary
audio, video and DAT tapes, a black "hole" actually makes these tapes
writeable.  Therefore, the red, write-enable flag will be in the exposed
(ERASE OFF) position.  Do NOT change the position of this flag.  If a
tape seems to be write enabled, contact me immediately.
 
Please let me know when they are ready to read.
Thanks.  :)

Eric:
  The guys on the aircraft were correct as far as contacting me. The video 
tapes will be sent to the Primary PI, Dinardo. Unless he says that videos from
those flights can be sent directly to you, you will have to negotiate with
him on copies. We are not in the business of making video copies. We do not 
archive them here, but send them off to the PI to do as they wish.
  As far as the "nav data" we process the flights and put out the variables
that you and Dinardo agree on. I am sure that he will be interested in the
same variables that you list below, but he may want to add some. In other words
we will produce only one data set  so it will have to contain all of the 
variables that both you and Steve want.
  The standard format for our data is the net-CDF format. If the data set is
small we can convert the net-CDF to ascii files. Again you and Steve need to
agree on a format. The data will be one per second values (averaged).

Ron:
  The nine Dinardo/Soil Moisture, Sea Salinity flights are processed and are
in the productiondata directory. I did not process the ferry flights because
the PI did not have his instrument on and is not interested.
  The file sizes range from about 4 MB to 17 MB. I think that we agreed that
we would put these on the ftp directory for user access in addition to
archiving them on the mass store. 
  When they are ready for access, please notify Steve Dinardo and Erik Knapp
via email with instructions for retrieving. Knapp is knapp@mirsl.ecs.umass and
Dinardo is steve.dinardo@jpl.nasa.gov. Dinardo has been in contact with
Chris Webster and has ncplot and is comfortable with net-CDF. I do not know
about Knapp, but Dinardo said not to worry about Knapp that Dinardo would 
help him out.

Dick,

The email address you gave me for Erik Knapp <knapp@mirsl.ecs.umass> bounced
back to me with the following error:

Do you know his correct email address?

  I checked what I have for Eric Knapp and it agrees with what I gave you.
Either I copied it down wrong or Dinardo gave it to me wrong.
