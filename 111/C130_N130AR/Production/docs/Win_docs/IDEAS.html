Instrument Development and Education in Airborne 
Science (IDEAS): Announcement of Opportunity



The Research Aviation Facility (RAF), a Facility in the Atmospheric Technology 
Division of NCAR, announces an instrumentation development program on the C-130 
Hercules during the months of April and October 2002. The program is called IDEAS for 
Instrumentation Development and Education in Airborne Science. 

IDEAS will include a total of 40 flight hours divided between the two periods.  The goal 
is to improve the capability of instrumentation for future NSF airborne deployments.   
The flights will originate from the RAF facility at the Jefferson County airport in 
Broomfield, CO.  They will be conducted in both clear and cloudy conditions to test 
RAF, NCAR and community instruments for airborne measurements.  The duration of 
the flights is expected to be between 3 to 6 hours.  A limited number of seats should be 
available for student participation, provided the student is able and willing to operate 
instrumentation and data systems after suitable instruction by NCAR scientists and 
technicians. 

The C-130 will measure state parameters (temperature, pressure, humidity), winds, 
aircraft position and attitude, infrared/visible/ultra-violet radiation and other ancillary 
measurements in addition to the instruments undergoing testing.

The RAF is seeking participants for IDEAS.   Several non-NCAR scientists and students 
can be accommodated on each flight, depending on the final payload configuration.  The 
guidelines for IDEAS are: 

*	The instrument to be tested should be one that is supported by the NSF or the results 
of the instrument test flight should support objectives of NSF supported research.  
The likelihood of the instrument use in future NSF projects will also be a 
consideration in selecting the payload for the C130.  
*	The required logistics associated with deploying the instrument will be considered in 
selecting instruments for the test flight payload.   Because of limited time, funds, and 
space on the aircraft, some instruments may not qualify.   
*	Instruments that have never flown before or instruments that are especially in need of 
flight testing to demonstrate a proof-of-concept are especially welcome.  
*	All participants must agree to make their data freely available and to provide copies 
of their final data in a timely manner.
*	The ability of scientists and students to participate in the flights, including flight 
planning, data analysis, and presentation of the results will be considered in selecting 
participants. 
*	Limited support for adapting instrumentation to fly on the C130 is available.  Travel 
funds are not available through the IDEAS program, however.  
*	Approximately one flight per week will be done during April and October. 
Instruments can be proposed for either or both months.  Between flights data review, 
instrumentation modifications, and flight planning will occur.  
*	The deadline for proposing an instrument for the April and October test periods will 
be 31 January 2002 and 31 August 2002, respectively.  Upload of the instrumentation 
will begin shortly after the deadlines.    The payload will be selected based on the 
feasibility of the installation and the above guidelines. 
To propose an instrument for IDEAS, please provide the following information.   
Prospective participants are encouraged to discuss their ideas with Jeff Stith, RAF 
Facility Manager (303 497  1032) or Dick Friesen, the IDEAS Project Manager (303 497 
1047). 
Description of IDEAS Participation

User-supplied Scientific Payload
Note:  All user-supplied equipment must meet RAF safety and design specifications.  
Refer to RAF Bulletin No. 3(http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Bulletins/bulletin3.html), RAF 
Bulletin No. 13 (http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Bulletins/bulletin13.html) and Design Guide 
RAF-DG-00-001 (http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Bulletins/Design_Guide.html).  Please provide 
the following information for each user-supplied scientific instrument:

Instrument Name:

Individual weight of all components:

Complete size dimensions of all components:
 
Rack-mountable 19? panel space required
(Note:  depth beyond 25? will overhang in back):
 
Supplying your own 19? rack (yes/no):
(Note:  racks must survive 9G crash load.)
 
Hazardous material required:

Radioactive sources or materials:

Power required (watts, volts, amps):
 
Type of power (DC, 60 Hz, 400 Hz):

External Sensor Location (if any):
 
Are Signal(s) to be recorded on RAF?s Aircraft 
Data System (yes/no)?
 
If yes:  Signal format (digital, analog, serial):
 
            Full-scale Voltage:

            Range:

            Resolution:

            Sample Rate (1, 5, 250 sps):
 
Need real-time, in-flight, RAF-measurement, serial 
data feed (RS-232, RS422)?
 
Need IRIG time-code feed?
 
Special sensor calibration service required?
 
Need full-time operator during flight?
 
Number of lap-top computers for on-board use:


Data Recording and Processing Requirements

What additional recording capability is needed?  Please give us details on the number of 
signals, their characteristics, format, synchronous, fire-wire, ethernet, etc.  (We may not 
be able to accommodate any and all signals.)

If nonstandard output formats and/or data rates are required, how often are the 
measurements needed?  Note: The standard format for processed, RAF output data is 
netCDF.  The standard output media are magnetic tape and ftp transfer.  (Nonstandard 
rates and/or formats will be considered as special processing requests.)

Will you be using your own recording system?


Supporting Services

Will you require air-ground communication? (If so, specify location of base station and 
operating frequencies.)

Will NCAR support be required in preparing this instrument for use on the aircraft (other 
than inspection, installation and power hookup).  ATD/RAF can provide design and 
fabrication support for hardware and electronic interfaces.  (If so, specify type and lead 
time.)
