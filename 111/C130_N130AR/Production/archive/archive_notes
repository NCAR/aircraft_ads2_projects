As of 16 April 2003, the IDEAS-1 project archive is not complete.

1)  Dave Rogers intends to produce production data for the RDMA which will
     be merged into the production netCDF files.
2)  Dave also is planning to update the QA report regarding the aerosol
     sampling and configurations.
The latter will obviously require changes to the web site.

So, the following scripts will need to be modified so the updated
files can be rearchived at the appropriate times:
  archprodnc.111
  tarit.doc (after web site changes)
  archive.support (after all changes)
    111.documents.tar
    111.documents.tar.dir
    111.tar
    111.tar.dir
    Mail.111
    taplog.111 (file size chages?)
    111rf01.hdr (header changes?)

(There may be more work to do.  If so, document it here, too.)
