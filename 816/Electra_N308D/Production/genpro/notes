FSSP
    Assumes:  Cell number 1 is in word 7  <--- need to check that
    The FSSP constants are as follows:
    These are the 16 size thresholds for range 0
      DATA SIZE/
     $3.0,4.7,8.5,12.9,15.0,16.9,20.5,25.2,27.6,31.7,37.8,40.1,44.4,
     $47.6,51.3,54.1/
    This is beam diameter and depth of field
        data bd/0.22/,dof/2.59/

 PROBLEM:   FSSP code only wants 15 cell sizes, not 16.  What should I do?
    It's not easy to "change to a look-up table"  Average these cell boundaries
    to get 15 average size cells.  --  OK

    Are the new FSSP bin sizes something just derived for this project?
    Does it have to do with the new interface?  Will our old code not work?

    DBARF = DISPF = 0 in current code, so far.
      Code seems to check out, so I don't know why they never read anything.
      (Darrel's black box ??)

---
X260
The variable names in the 260X subroutine need to be changed to accomodate
ones without the X beginning them.  Also, check to see if all 62 cells are
used for the SUMX6 (SUM626).  Sould cell #1 be omitted from this sum?
Make sure all variables are in proper locations in pdud file.

---
EVENTS
I need to find out how to decode the event markers and what to do with them.
    Delete them.  --  OK

---
IRS
Are there offsets for ROLL, PITCH and/or THI for the second IRS?  I must use
both of these as reference platforms during the project, so these data need to
be optimized.  Obtained.  --  OK

---
PLWC
Concerning the King probe, you mentioned a new TWIRE value for new code.
 What new code?  It's really code I already have (Don't use the z version.)
 Same code I already have.  --  OK

---
Special derived output variables:
XCVDPC -- uses SDPC
RHOCV  -- uses SRHOX
MRLA   -- needs new special subroutine
XO3FSC -- needs new special subroutine
XATO   -- needs new special subroutine
XATO   -- translate Ophir code from C to FORTRAN and adapt for GENPRO
RHOLA1 -- uses SDLA
LWCCZ  -- check subroutine operation with ASTEX's specific case.
          check variable rates (like CONCF)
TOWAT  -- develop with attention to rate differences among source variables
XMRTOW -- from new subroutine STOWAT
XTLWCC -- from new subroutine STOWAT

Rates of new variables:
Rate = 20:  XO3FSC, XCVDPC, RHOCV, MRLA 
Rate =  1:  XATO, XMRTOW, XTLWCC,

CVI stuff:   XCVCNO, XCVCNC, XCVFCC. XCVF2C, XCVFHC, XCVFXC, XCVFACT
From Schanot:  CVI derived variables will not be calculated

---
RATES:
Rate =   1 -->  1 variables:  CVTEMP, TET, TEP
Rate =   5 -->  1 variables:  XCVDP, CVFCN, CVPCN, XCVF2, XCVFH, XCVFX, XCVTT,
                              XO3FP, XO3FF, XO3FN, XO3FT, XO3FV, XCVST, XCVF1,
Rate =  50 --> 20 variables:  XCVLA, TTCF2, XO350, 
Rate = 250 --> 20 variables:  XO3FS, TTCF1, to be omitted on output

---
These variables are undefined (after INPUT):
     UHAW1, UHAW2, UHAW3
There are no descriptions of the following variables:
     UHAW1, UHAW2, UHAW3
These are to be dropped.

---
Why did you delete SPHUM?  It is a BULLETIN 9 standard output variable.
New revised Bulletin #9 omits it.

---
Don't forget to change IRS boxes for the specific flights.

---
Check output rate for CONCF.  

---
In GENPRO's CALIB subroutines, figure out how to get the IPSOU variables'
input rates (LRTSOU).

ALON2 -- decoding problem??

XO3FSC:  First flight is unique.  An offset needs to be removed from the
           calibration equation.  I'll do it by subtracting on offset of
           10. in INICAL for the XO3FSC variable.  This will make the
           subroutine work for all cases and document the special case.

XATO:  Need to get O3Fxx and OPHxx into pdud file for each specific flight.
         I guess it needs to be done similar to how astgxx is being inserted.
         Since two variables are now needed, I chose to put one in the
         standard CONSU space and the other in the (unused) PMS-200Y threshold
         space.

         Apparently there is a start-up problem with the XATO.  The first value
         looks like zero.  I'm not sure why that is happening, since the time
         segment I'm using is in mid-flight.  I need to investigate.  (I was
         putting out data with the wrong index into the data array.)

PLWCC:   There is still an offset of about 0.4 g/m3

HGME:  Calibration off a bit??  RF01 maneuvers:  it is saying 1685
                                                 PALT is at   1515
                                                 GALT is at   1512

RSTT:  Maneuvers:  constant at -4.02 C.  How is it on RF17?  The same!

CNTS1, CNTS2, UFCNT, CVCNT:  These "counts" are being interpolated from 5sps
               to 1sps.  Do you really want to do that?

XO3FT:  temperature in RF01 maneuvers says 410C, a bit warm?
        temperature in RF17           says 412.4C, a bit warm?

Lidar:
As of now, the staging data reside in the path name:
      /home/chinook/sloss/genpro/astex/lidar
They really belong in the path:
      /home/local/genpro/projects/astex/lidar

----------
Post-processing observations requiring rerun:

RF04 -- Ophir data curve-fit were compromised by bad curve-fit data.  Redone 
          with constants derived from averaging the previous and succeeding
          flights.  I changed the Ophir data for RF04 in the file "consts.816".
          The Cray log file from processing these data was lost.  The version
          on the MSS is from the original run and should only be used as an
          example.
        Successfully rerun:  4 December 1992

RF16 -- Lyman-alpha data were compromised by the reference dew point sensor
          being shut off briefly during the flight.  The Lyman-alpha software
          was changed to handle that situation.  The newly-modified version of
          the software is tdlaRF16.816.  Files created by this special run are:
          "catrcpRF16.816" and "califRF16.816".
        Successfully rerun:  11 December 1992
