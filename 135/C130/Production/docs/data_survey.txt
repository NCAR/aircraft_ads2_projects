Perhaps three categories or audiences:
  1) RICO project only
  2) all RAF projects with which you are familiar
  3) previous PIs and data users of our aircraft
Do we shoot for multiple-guess, essay or combination of both?

Questions for aircraft data users
(not in any particular order yet):
---------------------------------
preliminary data access OK?
view/analysis tools adequate?
measurements (number of and which) OK?
adequate measurement accuracy, precision, time resolution, trust
 (have we earned your confidence?)
documentation on measurement principles OK?
bad data flags useful?
missing_value/_FillValue useful/hindrance?
missing measurements? can you handle OK?
spatial resolution OK for your research?

project documentation web site valuable?
 what further information would you like to see on the project documentation web site?
value of data searches
search criteria you would find most valuable
 (e.g., time, location, measured values; a combination of these?)
 keywords?
familiar with our data archive?
 value to you of our data archive
  (assuming that we have the metadata you need for discovery)
 will obsolete GENPRO data formats hinder your use?
ever work with our raw data?
