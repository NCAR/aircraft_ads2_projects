<h1>RDCC Chat Client Configuration Instructions</h1>
(for the RICO project)</center>
<br>
<h3>Overview</h3>
The RDCC chat system is running a standard IRC server.&nbsp; There are
many IRC chat clients, including
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org">mozilla.org</a>'s
<b>Chatzilla</b> that will work with this server.&nbsp; Once you have properly
configured Chatzilla, you can simply enter in the URL
<a href="irc://rdcc.guest.ucar.edu/%26RICO?pass=60kw60E08p">irc://rdcc.guest.ucar.edu/&amp;RICO?pass=60kw60E08p</a>
to access the main RICO chatroom, for example.&nbsp; We have found that
<b>xchat</b> is also a good multi-platform chat client which offers enhanced
features such as logging, timestamps, etc.&nbsp; Since xchat running on a
Windows platform has been the most popular method, we have included more
detailed instructions for that type of installation here.&nbsp; There could
be slight changes to what you see here due to version number differences,
etc.&nbsp; but you should also be able to configure your particular choice
of chat client by extracting configuration information presented on this page
and entering it appropriately.&nbsp; Please pay particular attention to the
chat server name, the chat server password and the conventions for chatroom
names and nicknames.&nbsp;
