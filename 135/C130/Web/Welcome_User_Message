Welcome, new user.  

A registered "user" can read but cannot post to the
forums.  If you are officially assigned to the RICO
project or would like your membership upgraded to
Participant, please write back to us with a description
of your role and/or interests.

We require each Participant to be identified by his/her
"Real name."  To fulfill this requirement:  log on, click
on the "My Account" link in the upper left then click on
the "Edit your information" link.  Fill in "Your name"
at the top of the page (even though it is labeled
"optional").  Click on the "Save changes" button at
the bottom of the page.  

Thanks a lot.
RICO Forum Administration
