<cindy> Al--tell sonia no sign of dust yet
<SoniaLasherTrapp-ops> Cindy-- thanks for update, and please keep us advised!
<ads-c130> Al, just to let you know, ATRL has been a bit erratic this morning.  At one point it was about 20 degrees colder than the others.  Now it seems to be working properly.
<cindy> xgn1=6.25314485v
<JorgenJensen-ops> Great, thanks.
<JorgenJensen-ops> That is pretty high presicion!
<JorgenJensen-ops> Also for Dave R: How is the waterflow for the Wetbulb sensor?
<JorgenJensen-ops> Finally for Dave R: Given that wind speeds are about 10+ m/s in the mixed layer, can slides be exposed there for no more than 5 secs max - 3 secs may be better, thanks.
--> EricLoew-ops (Administra@vpn38.ucar.edu) has joined &C130Q
<AlSchanot-ops> OK Greg.  I'll tell Bill we need to swap out that sensor.  We had a short, similar event on a previous flt with a smaller deflection.
<AlSchanot-ops> I thought it was wetting, but with what you are seeing, it is more likely a loose wire.
<DaveR-c130> Andy ays \wet bulb 
<DaveR-c130> Andy says wetb water was not flowing early in flight.   He primed pump & it's going ok now.
<JorgenJensen-ops> Thanks.
<DaveR-c130>  GN samples 4 to 5 s at 90m, 1-carbon and 1-oil.

<MarkBradford-Boulder> Unknown server?  That sounds like a DNS problem.  What if they use the numeric address, 128.117.188.104 ?
<AlSchanot-ops> It was working up until this morning.  Other chat is fine.  this isn't tied to the security upgrades is it?
<MarkBradford-Boulder> Should have nothing to do with it -- the King Air isn't on the ops center network.  What do you mean by "other chat"?
<campos-Jeffco> In the RICO chatroom, Bart Geerts asked Bjorn or Harry to instruct the c-130 pilots to communicate to the KA pilots that they need to turn on the UDP forwarder (neccessary for tracks and chat).
<AlSchanot-ops> Perry say the forwarder is track only
<MarkBradford-Boulder> I'm sending e-mail to Mike Daniels and Ron Ruth describing the problem as well; but in principle if people in the ops center can connect to the chat, so can anyone.  If it's saying "unknown server" that sounds a lot like a DNS problem, but I don't know how the King Air is configured.
<AlSchanot-ops> OK.  we'll look into it on this end.
<MarkBradford-Boulder> My initial suggestion would be to try the numbers
<MarkBradford-Boulder> 128.117.188.104
<ads-c130> We just told the king air about the udp forwarder & they said they have had it on all morning.
