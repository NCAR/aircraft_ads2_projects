--- BjornStevens-c130q is now known as Bjorn-C130Q
<Bjorn-C130Q> Hi Bob, this is Bjorn in the Back, Harry is taking us through a 3000ft leg.  
<Bjorn-C130Q> We have had a very pleasing flight so far.  We decided to go with the South Patch because its location was favorable and we were given the impression that it developed as we worked it upwind of the ship.
<BobRauber-ops> Bjorn,  The strongest radar echoes in the area you are flying come from the Frigate birds
<Bjorn-C130Q> We have had plenty of radio coordination with KA and the ship, but the KA did not find these clouds too interesting.  The ship says they are the best they had all day.  The patch went right between the ship and Barbuda
<Bjorn-C130Q> Should be quite interesting from the combined sensor point of view, we shall see.
--> BobWells-ops (rowel@69.50.67.218) has joined &RICO
<BobRauber-ops> There are very weak echoes at best - no precip, but the clouds are still hanging around
<Bjorn-C130Q> Well there is plenty that we are happy with, plenty of precip on windows at 3500ft, I haven't been watching at this altitude.
--> rafchem-c130 (rico@ras6.ucar.edu) has joined &RICO
<Bjorn-C130Q> I also think we did a better job today of getting repeat penetrations, and also several razor slices of cloud top.
<BobRauber-ops> Hard to believe from down here
<BobRauber-ops> Hardly a blue echo to be had - all little gray dots
<BobRauber-ops> Glad to hear it is turning out well
<Bjorn-C130Q> Here is a nice cloud top penetration, but I could not tell about clouds.  BTW just because you can't make out the echoe does not mean there is no precip.  Watch the probes on this next pass.

<Bjorn-C130Q> water on windshield on that pass at 3000 ft.  
<BobRauber-ops> I agree with that - there is just not enough to get the radar too excited
<BobRauber-ops> Volume averaging is wiping out the signal
<Bjorn-C130Q> Okay, I am going up front, what is the upstream prognosis.. do you see anything well upwind of the  ship?
<Bjorn-C130Q> Also what happened to the dust?
<Bjorn-C130Q> I will wait a few minutes before I head up front.
<BobRauber-ops> Our best estimate of the dust is that it is well SW of our area, based on the visible satellite
<BobRauber-ops> Maybe tomorrow, but today, I'll just skip dusting the furniture
<BobRauber-ops> Upwind of the ship it is more of the same.
--> rucker-ncar (rucker@dyn78-17.atd.ucar.edu) has joined &RICO
<BobRauber-ops> hang on - I am updating my satellite image
<BobRauber-ops> More of the same for the remainder of the flight, unless something pops
<BobRauber-ops> A very supressed area is moving over the region.  No deeper clouds in area.
<BobRauber-ops> Nice tails on islands, however
<BobRauber-ops> Dust is SE of area, not SW.  My lefthandedness is showing
<Bjorn-C130Q> Thanks Bob,  I am leaving the back and heading off chat.  Our sense is that the patch we are working has played itself out.  We will tyr some clouds at 3500 and then come back down to 2500 for 20 minutes before heading into circles and back home.  Also can you quick check with AL (I never saw his answer) if our reverse heading maneuver was okay, as we can repeat if necessary
--- JimMoore is now known as JimMoore-ops
<BobRauber-ops> Al is not here at the moment
<Bjorn-C130Q> Okay, well we will assume they are go.  Finding plenty of stuff at 3500 in this patch, with more stuff on the windshield.  I am off now
<-- BobWells-ops has quit (Quit: Leaving)
--- Bjorn-C130Q is now known as DaveR-c130
<JorgenJensen-ops> Regarding reverse heading maneuvres, looks OK, but we have slightly different calibration constants on the aircraft and here on the ground. Al has done work during the project on the ground calibration values. Hence, we will have to get the actual data to know with certainty, but from the real-time data the legs looked well executed.

--> ReneeRay-Boulder (chatzilla@dyn78-25.atd.ucar.edu) has joined &RICO
<BobRauber-ops> Bjorn,  Tomorrow is a difficult forecast as far as cloud organization, but it will be a good flight regardless.  Weather looks good.
<BobRauber-ops> The primary issue is how the clouds will phase with a trough that is coming through.
<BobRauber-ops> Trough is supressing clouds over us right now.  If axis passes, we will have deeper clouds with more clusters and lines.
<BobRauber-ops> If trough stays east, then it will be more like today.
<BobRauber-ops> In any case, we fly
<BjornStevens-C130Q> Even now in what looks like pretty supressed condtions we find nice clusters, you just have to hunt a bit.  We had no trouble finding things that would put precip on our window at 3000ft.
<BobRauber-ops> bjorn - you there?
<BjornStevens-C130Q> What I have noticed is that if you find a patch of clouds just work it and often good things happen.  My sense was that the patch we worked started out questionable, but then got more interesting and faded.  Would be interesting to see if this shows up at all on Radar.  
<BjornStevens-C130Q> In anycase, it is nice to see a return to more desired forms of convective organization.
<BobRauber-ops> Bjorn - do you need a ride back to Jolly Harbor or do you have your car with you?
<BjornStevens-C130Q> We are four minutes into our 1500' circle
<BjornStevens-C130Q> Yeah
