This directory contains daily chat logs which were extracted from the master
logs in its parent directory:  /net/www/docs/rdp/projects/RICO/chatlog/
Each log covers a daily UTC time period from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59.

I used my own discretion when sanitizing, and I probably wasn't consistent.
I definitely filtered out any sensitive information, like IP numbers, phone
numbers, lock combinations and passwords.  I also omitted some dialogs that
had absolutely nothing to do with the RICO project.  However, I'm sure that
some sensitive and/or non-relevant entries remain.

It may be reasonable to remove all log entries that have no conversation,
i.e., the coming/going entries.  Since these logs are not "complete," there
is no way to know exactly who was in a chatroom when an entry was made.
