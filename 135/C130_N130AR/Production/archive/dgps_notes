Questions for Pavel:

1)  What processor/software was used to calculate all the values in
     this data set?  Are there references or other documentation you
     can provide?
2)  How are the standard deviations determined?  Are they calculated?
     Is there a standard time interval for them?
3)  How closely are these data synchronized with the measurements in
     our standard production netCDF files?
4)  Are there any "missing" data points in these files?  If so, how are
     they indicated?
5)  Can these data be translated into netCDF files and given a
     meaningful header for each flight?  If so, we also need to create
     some standard variable names and descriptions consistent with RAF's
     naming conventions as well as some good global attributes.
6)  Would it make sense to merge these data into the production netCDF
     files?
7)  Your "readme.txt" file has a non-printing character (on my Linux
     workstation).  It is in the sentence:
      "Most significant effect on relative height is caused by pitch
      changes and can be as high as 1.3 m when pitch reaches its
      extremes at about <B1>10 deg."
     What is <B1> ?
8)  Do you have a recommendataion about how data users can assimilate
     the DGPS data into their analysis (along with our other data
     products)?
9)  Will we be making these measurements for more projects?  If so, we
     need to standardize the procedures on how everything is done.
