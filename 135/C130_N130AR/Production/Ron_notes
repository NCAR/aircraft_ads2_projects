Allen's web document sources for RICO can be found in /jnet/win_jef1/allen
with 135 in the file name.

Today I moved the RICO chatlogs from directory:
   /net/www/docs/rdp/projects/RICO/chatlog
to
   /jnet/local/proj/135/Web/Chat/chatlog

Now all the chat stuff is in one place.

Yesterday I copied the special ultra-high-rate files with the 1000 sps
PVM-100 data to the directory:  /net/ftp/pub/archive/RAF-projects/RICO/pvm100

The Header_GLWC.txt file is a netCDF header dump from RF01.
The PVM100_Catalog.txt summarizes each file's date/time file-size information.
The README file has file-retrieval and gunzip information.

The new Time variable is comprised of all zeros for all the low-rate
production netCDF files except RF01 (135rf01.nc).  All the high-rate
files are OK.

I copied the low-rate and high-rate production netCDF files for FF05 
to /jnet/data and ran "ncfix" to correct the date fields, since the
ADS header had 01/25/2005 instead of 01/26/2005.  Even though this
program is ancient and had to run on mead (Solaris), it seemed to
work just fine.  When replacing the file on the Mass Store, it will
have an unique name, since its date is different.  It, therefore,
will not overwrite the extant file.  The only caveat is that, since
it's still there, Susan's retrieval web site can see it, and it can
be retrieved just like the other data.  Perhaps I should protect it
with a read password.  I'll think about that.

For the last couple days Chris W and I have been working to fix up the
problem files.  We have had our problems with system changes hampering
our ability to do that as well as filling up all the space on
/jnet/productiondata.

The tasks:
 - fix date for both FF05 (LRT, HRT)
 - fix bogus base_time for RF19 HRT
 - fix base_time to agree with the TimeInterval start time on all flights.
 - fix Time variable for the LRT files except for RF01 (They are all zeroes.)

As of this afternoon:
Have run "ncReorder" on all RICO HRT flights.
Have run "fix_time" on all RICO LRT flights except RF01 which didn't need it.

Now I plan to move all the originally-archived MSS bitfiles to the /RAF
directory and archive the fixed ones to the /ATD/DATA directory.

Finished rearchiving both LRT and HRT data sets with the above corrections.
Also recreated taplog files and updated the web site via the "changes" web
page.

After Allen reprocessed the PMS-2D data and merged the results into the
2nd production netCDF files, I moved the originals on the Mass Store to
the directory /RAF/2005/135/2ND_PRODUCTION/LRT/ and archived the new versions
in the reference directory  /ATD/DATA/200[45]/RICO/C130_N130AR/LRT/.

The new nimbus processor (used for the PMS-2D processing) has been archived
using its Subversion revision number (3436):
 /RAF/2005/135/nimbus_3436.tar.dir
 /RAF/2005/135/nimbus_3436.tar
 /RAF/2005/135/nimbus_defaults_3436.tar.dir
 /RAF/2005/135/nimbus_defaults_3436.tar

Some files in the parent directory (C130_N130AR) were used to convert Teresa's
ASCII Ozone data files to netCDF.  (See script o32cdf.)  The gattribs* files
were meant to add global attributes to each file, but the files converted with
them would not work with ncplot.  For documentation purposes, these attributes
can be added back after the files' data have been merged into the RICO
production data files.

I discovered, while trying to convert these, that "asc2cdf" doesn't like
certain characters to appear in variable names:  "/" and possibly "^" and
"_".  I'm not totally sure why.  The program never produced an error report
or other sign of failure other than failing to output the "Time interval
completed = ..." message just before it quit.

The general RICO email list is:
     rico@eol.ucar.edu
Apparently there are a bunch of specialized lists which, I think, are
subsets of this one.  (Steve Williams has more information.)

Once all reprocessing is done and everything is OK, update the archive.support
script and update all the support files on the MSS.

Created new support archive script (archive.support_3) since I don't have
permission to edit the previous version.  Archived all "changed" support
files and renamed some MSS bitfiles which I thought ought to be saved
rather than overwritten.

Updated catalog files msls.135 and msls.rico
