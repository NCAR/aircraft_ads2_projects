Dec 03 09:39:42 <jorgen-c130>	John, I need to get a fairly lenghty message to Jeff. Jeff may be in with Al Cooper, so can you just take notes?
Dec 03 09:40:44 <jorgen-c130>	CXowan, did you copy the last message?
Dec 03 09:41:33 <jorgen-c130>	John Cowan, are you there?
Dec 03 09:43:21 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Yes I'm here now.
Dec 03 09:43:45 <jorgen-c130>	OK, I'll start typing
Dec 03 09:43:46 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	If you type it all in I will just print it out.
Dec 03 09:44:00 <jorgen-c130>	OK
Dec 03 09:44:47 <jorgen-c130>	Hi Jeff. The following START instruments can and cannot be carried as part of the Prog Sci flights:
Dec 03 09:44:57 <Ron-c_log>	Jorgen, I can harvest lines from the chatlog if you type in a bunch of stuff
Dec 03 09:45:03 <jorgen-c130>	Whole air sampler: NO, insufficient space.
Dec 03 09:46:25 <jorgen-c130>	CU hygrometer: Possibly. Depends on rack space in the Denver U. racks for New Particle formation. I have to ask Shanhu Lee from DSenver U on Monday.
Dec 03 09:47:28 <jorgen-c130>	NOAA ozone: Possibly. Again, depends on available rack space in Denver U racks and/or HAFTSO control rack.
Dec 03 09:48:34 <jorgen-c130>	CAPS: NO. Too many other external things to do, I think. Mark and Jack may be consulted, but my feeling is a no.
Dec 03 09:49:07 <jorgen-c130>	Harward CO/CH4/CO2: NO. Insufficient space.
Dec 03 09:50:43 <jorgen-c130>	RAF CO: Already part of CHAPS, so space is OK. I think that Teresa has polanned to make mods to make it functioning at above 25kft. Anyway sensor will be onboard.
Dec 03 09:51:47 <jorgen-c130>	Stratospheric humidity: Possibly. It is planned as a GAP instrument and it is thus funding dependent. Good chance if funds are approved.
Dec 03 09:52:06 <jorgen-c130>	Dropsonde system: YES.
Dec 03 09:52:42 <jorgen-c130>	End of START project comments, but more comments about Prog Sci follows.
Dec 03 10:00:44 <jorgen-c130>	DOCIMS comments: HIAPER standard instruments, plus the following dwesired instruments only: King lwc, CN counter, dropsondes, CO, sat images. The following cannot be accomodated: Lidar. fast ozone (insufficient space) END of DOCIMS comments, The remaining limitations depend on what the workshops and Mark can get done in time. - Jorgen
Dec 03 10:01:28 <jorgen-c130>	John Cowan, end of my message to Jeff Stith. He can reach me with comments on the flight. Thanxs.
Dec 03 10:02:23 <jorgen-c130>	Thanks also to Ron - I didn't see your message until now. Pls coordinate with Cowan. thanks.
Dec 03 10:10:16 <Ron-c_log>	Jorgen, got it all logged.  Will edit and pass along to Jeff.
Dec 03 10:21:25 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	IMPORTANT!!!! Does anyone one the C-130 have the combination to the WYOMING Seatainer?  It is at customs now and they DO NOT have the Combo!!!
Dec 03 10:24:29 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Did anyone get my message?
Dec 03 10:24:34 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Hello???
Dec 03 10:24:43 <jorgen-c130>	john.  yes we have it. give me a minute to dig it out
Dec 03 10:27:13 <jorgen-c130>	john.  combo for UW seatainer is: 31 - 37 - 15
Dec 03 10:27:58 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Thanks Jorgen, I will relay that to them.
Dec 03 10:53:38 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Al, Could you ask John Cusack where the KEYS to his truck are.  He parked it in the wrong place and it needs to be moved. This is from Jimmy.
Dec 03 10:58:58 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	AL are you there???
Dec 03 10:59:04 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Hello C-130??
Dec 03 11:00:54 <Allen-C130>	look for a magnetic key box on back bumper
