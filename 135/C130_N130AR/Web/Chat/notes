After playing with the chatlogs for "C130Q," "RICO" and "dropsonde" yesterday,
I discovered this morning that these three files haven't been updated since.
(I was merging Mike Daniels' logs as a missing section to the master files.)
Apparently by editing with vi, it locked the file, and xchat, via the NFS
mount, created a new, hidden file to continue the logging operation.  This
was a good thing.  The file names are:
    /net/www/docs/rdp/projects/RICO/chatlog/.nfs001c63e100000008  (C130Q)
    /net/www/docs/rdp/projects/RICO/chatlog/.nfs001c63e70000000a  (RICO)
    /net/www/docs/rdp/projects/RICO/chatlog/.nfs001c63ec00000009  (dropsonde)
In the past, if a file changed during editing, I would get a message telling
me that the file changed since I modified it.  I then could reimport the file
anew with no loss.  I'm wondering if this is a new "feature" of RedHat
Enterprise Linux.

So from now on, I plan to copy the file, make changes and then figure out
a way to merge the changed file back in or just keep a new file to do the
logging.

The chatlog files should be edited to have RICO phase 2 separated from RICO
phase 1.  Later the files should be further broken down into missions and/or
dates.  I also need to create sanitized versions.  It's amazing how much time
this all takes.

Since the hidden files could not be accessed by the RICO Forum web site,
we decided to restart xchat and reset the file logging.  When I exited the
running xchat client, the three hidden files (mentioned above) disappeared!
To preserve them, a link or copy should have been made of these files before
exiting.  (Remember this for the future!)  Now the three affected chatlogs
have about 24-hour holes in them (~21:30 11 Jan 2005 to 22:37 12 Jan 2005).
Mike Daniels was keeping a chat session on his machine during part of this
period and emailed me text files from it for the two important channels.
However, they have no time stamps.  (The third channel only had people
joining and leaving, so there is really no need to update it.)

The files:
  xchat_rico_01112005.txt
  xchat_c130q_01112005.txt
are non-time-stamped logfiles from Mike's computer as an attempt to 
recover parts the missing pieces of the main chatlog files for RICO
and C130Q.

Future plans/priciples regarding chat logging.

1.  Do not edit an active chatlog file.  Instead, make a copy of it and
     do editing there.  Keep this copy in the project's Web/Chat subdirectory.
2.  If the chat session, for some reason, begins logging to a hidden scratch
     file, create a hard link to it and/or copy it somewhere before exiting
     xchat.  Also, start a new, temporary xchat session on a different
     machine before exiting to preserve any traffic that occurs while the
     logging xchat session is restarting.
3.  Edit copies of the chatlogs to separate them into RICO phases 1 and 2.
4.  Further edit copies to create individual logs for each "mission."
5.  Sanitize the copies before publishing.

The chat logs got contaminated when the FL servers rebooted about 15:30 UTC.
Log entries in all chatrooms were replaced by garbage characters sometime
after 27 Jan 2005 14:59:40 and before 27 Jan 2005 15:29:54.

After a mahler reboot before Thu Jan 27 09:38:11 2005, the time zone didn't
get reset to UTC.  Therefore. all time stamps after that reboot are in MST.
These must be cleaned up.  (All of the following begin in the 16th hour UTC,
not the 9th hour MST.)

I finished breaking up and sanitizing the chat logs.  There is still a
"need" to correct the raw chatlog time stamps after the mid-morning
reboot on 27 January 2005.  (The one sanitized chatlog covering that
time, c130q.xchatlog.20050127, has been fixed.)

Here are some "tasks" that could be accomplished with the chatlogs:
 - combine the separate, raw chatlogs into one file for each chat room
 - remove all entries related to people entering and leaving chatrooms
 - have someone else review the raw and sanitized files to check up on my
    censorship
 - move all the chatlog files to a more appropriate place in the file system

Today I moved the RICO chatlogs from directory:
   /net/www/docs/rdp/projects/RICO/chatlog
to
   /jnet/local/proj/135/Web/Chat/chatlog

Now all the chat stuff is in one place.
