The time conversions were performed by two "awk" scripts:
   /jnet/shared/proj/archives/scripts/awk_chat_time_change - adds 7 hours to time stamps
   /jnet/shared/proj/archives/scripts/awk_chat_time_shift  - adds 3 min 57 sec to time stamps (Mike's computer time-offset)

The following files needed no new editing, since they were corrected on a previous occasion:
   c130q_chatlog.txt
   rico_chatlog.txt
   dropsonde_chatlog.txt

The following files need no editing, since no traffic occurred during the down period:
   pam_chatlog.txt
   gaus_chatlog.txt

For files edited on or after 12 January 2005:
  the original name format is:      <chatroom>_chatlog.txt;
  the newly-edited name format is:  <chatroom>.log

The following files have been edited today:
  kingair.log
  network.log
  spol.log
