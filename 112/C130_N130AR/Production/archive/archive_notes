As of 16 April 2003, the IDEAS-2 project archive is not complete.

1)  Dave Rogers intends to produce production data for the RDMA which will
     be merged into the production netCDF files.
2)  Dave also is planning to update the QA report regarding the aerosol
     sampling and configurations.
The latter will obviously require changes to the web site.

Based on the file "data_file_notes" a few bitfiles should be removed from
the archive.  (There is no timetable for this at present.)

So, the following scripts will need to be modified so the updated
files can be rearchived at the appropriate times:
  archprodnc.112
  tarit.doc (after web site changes)
  archive.support (after all changes)
    112.documents.tar
    112.documents.tar.dir
    112.tar
    112.tar.dir
    Mail.112
    taplog.112 (file size chages?)
    112rf01.hdr (header changes?)

(There may be more work to do.  If so, document it here, too.)
