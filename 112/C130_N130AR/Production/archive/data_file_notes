According to Chris Webster (with partial corroboration from Dave Rogers),
the following files are bogus and should not remain in the
SCD Mass Store System archive:

112rf01.2d    (something about a TAS cable not connected or loose)
  /ATD/DATA/2002/IDEAS-2/C130_N130AR/PMS2D/RF01

112rf03a.2d   (something about a TAS cable not connected or loose)
  /ATD/DATA/2002/IDEAS-2/C130_N130AR/PMS2D/RF03

112rf04a.2d   (something about a TAS cable not connected or loose)
  /ATD/DATA/2002/IDEAS-2/C130_N130AR/PMS2D/RF04

112rf04a.rawMCRa  (MCR not mounted on the aircraft)
  /RAF/2002/112/RAW_MCR/RF04

RF05 had some on-the-ground transients for the first couple minutes.
I recommend using a start time of 20:52:30 instead of 20:51:35.

RF06 had a serial feed problem which rendered all the RDMA data useless
after the system was restarted in flight.  In the first section was a
data gap while the aircraft was still on the ground.  I recommend using
a start time of 20:19:27 instead of 12:20:21.
