RF02, RF03 and RF05 have photo galleries.  RF06 has a short video clip

Our pics are "public" and not copyrighted, since they were taken to document
the project.  Why are the RF07 pics treated differently?
Can we "buy" the rights to them or ask that they be released?

After a phone conversation on 18 November ~ 4:00 p.m. with Nita, the
restrictions are meant for outside users of the photos.  We (RAF) can post
them to our web site without any restrictions.
