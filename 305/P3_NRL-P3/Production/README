305rf05a is ground data only. The file stops before takeoff.
Thus use 305rf05b as the only airborne file.

FF02:   AKRD values (offset and gain) are iterated to get
pitch=attack. We have no reliable calibration for this flight,
but the iterated values are very good.

RF01:   AKRD values (offset and gain) are iterated to get
pitch=attack. We have no reliable calibration for this flight,
but the iterated values are very good. Note - values are
different from FF02

RF01-RF13a: TTRL has had the offset increased by 0.6 degrees
(warmer). Check with dropsondes if ATRL or ATRR is better.
