Jul 12 06:52:54 <birwin>	larry, how's it going\
Jul 12 06:53:38 <birwin>	we're not seeing any data down here yet?

Jul 12 06:54:49 <Jorgen>	Hi, Bill, can you get me?
Jul 12 06:55:22 <Jorgen>	Somehow it kept asking for passwords, but once I hit cancel, it started working.
Jul 12 06:55:28 <bonnie-c130>	winds aloft were about 20 kts out of the west on the transit to NST2 - Steve, does that jive with the forecast?
Jul 12 06:57:08 <birwin>	yes got you Jorgen
Jul 12 06:58:10 <Jorgen>	Thanx
Jul 12 06:59:24 <ads-c130>	Bill, all seems OK from this end except for the MCR display. AC Tracker has been running.
Jul 12 06:59:49 <birwin>	ok, thanks larry, most likely on my end
Jul 12 07:01:06 <ads-c130>	MCR displays mostly white screen on lower channels. I can see the housekeeping.
Jul 12 07:16:13 <ads-c130>	Seeing any data on the ground?
Jul 12 07:18:17 -->	aulenbac (aulenbac@cgdowl.cgd.ucar.edu) has joined &C130Q
Jul 12 07:19:34 <Jorgen>	Hi Larry,
Jul 12 07:19:44 <Jorgen>	Nope - no data on the ground
Jul 12 07:20:03 <aulenbac>	steve here
Jul 12 07:21:53 -->	beaton (beaton@sbmac.atd.ucar.edu) has joined &C130Q
Jul 12 07:22:43 <ads-c130>	AC tracker has been up and running and seems fine from here. I am not sure if there is anything else that I can do.

Jul 12 07:33:08 <beaton>	Larry, Could you or somebody check that the digital camera is recording OK? By going back to that computer and typing "ls NetCam" in a terminal and checking that the last file has the right time?

Jul 12 07:42:57 <ads-c130>	Stu, camera is recording OK.
Jul 12 07:46:41 <birwin>	larry change the range on mcr display (voltage range from
Jul 12 07:46:53 <birwin>	0-10 to 0-5 volts, try that
Jul 12 07:48:56 <ads-c130>	MCR is already set 0-5 volts.
Jul 12 07:49:59 -->	Jcowan-Jeffco (jcowan@dyn84-150.atd.ucar.edu) has joined &C130Q
Jul 12 07:50:13 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Hey Larry,  John Here on chat now.
Jul 12 07:50:37 <ads-c130>	Morning John.
Jul 12 07:51:16 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Did you get the MCR Display working better?
Jul 12 07:52:47 <ads-c130>	Well, I am now seeing stuff on the middle channels more so than the lower and upper channels.
Jul 12 07:54:50 <beaton>	Larry, Thanks for checking the camera. 
Jul 12 07:55:51 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Did you try changing the "range" on the display.  If there are low light levels that means low voltages coming in so you will only see low levels in thos channels.
Jul 12 07:57:04 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	To change the range, I think in the lower right corner of the display is a place you can type in a min and max volts for the color table.  If you an cannot find it I will show it to you when you get back.
Jul 12 07:58:18 <ads-c130>	It is now set O-5 volts.
Jul 12 08:04:20 -->	perseus-c130 (perseus-c1@ras82.ucar.edu) has joined &C130Q
Jul 12 08:04:27 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Is You can drop it down if the returns are still low.  The only thing you are changing is the display.  If you are seeing signals only up to 1 volt you can drop that to 0 to 1 or 1.5 volts to get more colors resolution in the display.
Jul 12 08:09:37 <ads-c130>	John, changing the range to 0-1.5 VDC helped the display look better on Ch. 1.
Jul 12 08:10:49 -->	sean (sean@toyon.mmm.ucar.edu) has joined &C130Q
Jul 12 08:11:23 <ads-c130>	Are you getting any data on the ground yet?
Jul 12 08:12:32 <steveaulenbach_>	Nothing yet on the real-time website.
Jul 12 08:13:02 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	We are still not seeing any ION data.  I am assuming that you have AC tracker going.  All I get when I look at the data screen is a black box.  The tracker has no data.  I guess we will just have tyo wait for you to tell us in chat when you are coming back.
Jul 12 08:14:49 <ads-c130>	AC tracker seems to be working fine. Is there anyone there that can look into Ion data?
Jul 12 08:15:18 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Not yet.  We will get Janet or Barandon to look at it as soon as they come in.
Jul 12 08:16:08 <steveaulenbach_>	Ion flight track shows a single "X" and latest time as 17:04:09 UTC
Jul 12 08:16:47 <ads-c130>	Oh yeah, I forgot that it is only 08:15.
Jul 12 08:18:18 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Yep, the day shift is just starting <grin>. We are though bright eyed an bushy tailed.

Jul 12 08:49:56 <ads-c130>	we're back.
Jul 12 08:51:14 <beaton>	Larry, could you check the camera files again, and also see if the last file time matches the GPS time? (Time is the last 6 digits of the file name.) Thanks.
Jul 12 08:51:35 <ads-c130>	Checking.
Jul 12 08:51:49 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Did you have an AC tracker dump? 
Jul 12 08:52:34 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Also do you have an ETA yet.  Bill said about 0930.
Jul 12 08:53:57 <ads-c130>	Iridium shut down, no ETA yet, camera files recording and the times are correct.
Jul 12 08:54:26 <beaton>	Wonderful! Thanks again.
Jul 12 08:54:50 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Thanks, Larry.
Jul 12 08:54:54 <beaton>	Well, wonderful about the camera anyway
Jul 12 08:56:03 <ads-c130>	Yeah John, the phone powered itself down again and I had to turn it back on.
Jul 12 08:58:25 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Okay.  I'm not sure what is causing that.  Might want to let Kurt know when you land.  Maybe we need to try the other phone and see if that solves that problem?

Jul 12 09:30:30 <ads-c130>	AFAIK, ETA is still 10.
Jul 12 09:30:43 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Thanks Larry I will relay that to the ground crew.
