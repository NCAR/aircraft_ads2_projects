Jul 12 14:16:36 <beaton>	John, Could you check the camera for me? Thanks.
Jul 12 14:18:26 <ads-c130>	Checking.
Jul 12 14:20:25 <ads-c130>	Stuart, the time seemd wrong.  it was 195210 but gps is 2020.  Is that correct or is it off?
Jul 12 14:21:20 <ads-c130>	Climbing to 13K
Jul 12 14:23:57 <ads-c130>	Now climbing to 17500 enroute to Rollins Pass.
Jul 12 14:24:39 <beaton>	That sounds off. Is it still adding images?
Jul 12 14:25:37 <ads-c130>	I tink so let me check.
Jul 12 14:26:16 <beaton>	You can type "ls | tail" to list the last 10 files.
Jul 12 14:26:54 <ads-c130>	Yes it is still adding images.  The times seem to be offset by about 30 minutes,
Jul 12 14:29:07 <beaton>	Curious, it matched GPS fine on the ground.
Jul 12 14:30:04 <ads-c130>	I could stop it and start it again if you anted.
Jul 12 14:31:28 <ads-c130>	Starting descent.
Jul 12 14:31:50 <beaton>	The camera time is also shown at the top left of the "live" picture, update every 2 seconds. If that time is off, go ahead and try stopping and restarting it.
Jul 12 14:32:35 <ads-c130>	Checking....
Jul 12 14:35:11 <ads-c130>	Okay, I was looking at the wrng side of the screen.  There are two columns of numbers and I was looking at the left one not the right.  The times match okay.  I guess I need to fly more <grin>.
Jul 12 14:36:38 <ads-c130>	Over Rollins pass heading toward the Tower.
Jul 12 14:36:39 <beaton>	Whew! That hopeful thought crossed my mind, but I thought, "No, i won't risk insulting him by suggesting that"!
Jul 12 14:37:44 <ads-c130>	Don't worry, it takes more then that to insult me.  I need to be checked often.  Glad there was no problem.\
Jul 12 14:40:17 <beaton>	If you could check it for me again in ~1/2 hour, I would appreciate it. I'm going to go get something for lunch. Thanks.
