May 20 06:49:40 <Jorgen>	Larry - Is all well? I want to go out for breakfast if everything is running on rails.
May 20 06:50:29 <bonnie-c130>	about to reach NST1, wind 60 kts out of SW so could get bumpy, all well from the cockpit
May 20 06:50:30 <ads-c130>	All looks very good right now.
May 20 06:50:35 <Jorgen>	OK
May 20 06:51:15 <aulenbac>	Niwot Tundra cam shows low broken clouds

May 20 07:23:10 <ads-c130>	xla1 is about -2.5 volts right now.

May 20 07:47:10 <ads-c130>	It is still running (updating) but none of the buttons respond. Any help?
May 20 07:50:39 <Jorgen>	Hi Larry, I'm back. Is Bonnie up in the cockpit or where?
May 20 07:50:50 <ads-c130>	I need a way to restart winds on Bonnie.
May 20 07:51:07 <ads-c130>	Bonnie is the cockpit.
May 20 07:53:32 <birwin>	restart bonnie, if you need to turn it off first, so be it
May 20 07:54:55 <ads-c130>	I would need to shut down the computer.
May 20 07:55:05 <birwin>	another way to try is request_winds bonnie (or host name) (cr)
May 20 07:55:19 <birwin>	from hercules
May 20 07:55:46 <birwin>	you need only shut down the lap top bonnie, not hercules as that would shut down disc win

May 20 08:05:22 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Larry what is non-responsive? Sorry I'm late and missed the first part of the problem.
May 20 08:05:42 <--	bonnie-c130 has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
May 20 08:09:24 <ads-c130>	Eventually I figured out that all of Bonnie was non-respopnsive.
May 20 08:09:47 <ads-c130>	I had to reboot Bonnie, all is well.
May 20 08:10:08 <Jorgen>	OK - it sounds like all is OK again?
May 20 08:10:19 <Jorgen>	OK
May 20 08:10:26 <ads-c130>	Yes
May 20 08:10:47 <birwin>	good job larry
May 20 08:10:47 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Good fix Larry.
May 20 08:12:43 <ads-c130>	See, maybe you won't have to replace me with a new guy?
May 20 08:13:24 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	No, it takes to long to train a new one up.  Your stuck for the forseeable future. <grin>.
May 20 08:13:58 <ads-c130>	Lucky for me!
May 20 08:14:59 <ads-c130>	What's up with printing on Hercules?
May 20 08:16:25 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Chris did not get that fixed before he left. There is no Winds printing from any station.  We don't know when it will be fixed.
May 20 08:16:42 <birwin>	read low priority
May 20 08:18:19 <ads-c130>	I did get a printout from Clyde.
May 20 08:19:11 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Hmm.  That's interesting.  I don't have an answer for you on that then. 
May 20 08:33:28 -->	bonnie-c130 (bonnie-c13@ras50.ucar.edu) has joined &C130Q
May 20 08:33:47 <birwin>	yeah, our understand from Chris was no printing from any winds station
May 20 08:34:32 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	I wonder though if msybe it's just Hercules and if the other staions will still print?
May 20 08:35:46 <bonnie-c130>	britt back on in the cockpit after rebooting laptop - all well.  I just started watching the down camera images at 1 sec update.  Can someone please check with Stuart to make sure this won't cause any problems? thanks
May 20 08:36:51 <ads-c130>	Only Clyde prints.
May 20 08:36:52 <beaton>	One second updates should not be a problem, even if a few computers are showing them. 
May 20 08:37:56 <beaton>	If you want to be certain, get on Clyde, go to the NetCam directory, and type ls to get a directory listing. Then do it again a few seconds later. 
May 20 08:38:54 <beaton>	Since the filenames are in the form "c130_down_date_time.jpg", you can check that more images have been written by comparing the time in the filename.
May 20 08:42:41 <aulenbac>	c130, what's your next waypoint?
May 20 08:49:29 <bonnie-c130>	we are about 15 min. off my estimated schedule, and Dave is done flask sampling, so we are aborting the second rollercoaster, now heading direct to NST5
May 20 08:49:56 <bonnie-c130>	do you think they have a donut shop in Montrose?
May 20 08:50:32 <aulenbac>	Googling ...
May 20 08:52:02 <brandon>	Daylight Donuts
May 20 08:52:02 <brandon>	633 S Townsend Av

May 20 08:53:30 <bonnie-c130>	that's great Dave was getting a bit nervous / low blood sugar
May 20 08:54:53 <aulenbac>	How was the cloud cover over Niwot?
May 20 08:55:20 <bonnie-c130>	stuart - did you mean clyde or the laptop in back?
May 20 08:56:34 <beaton>	I meant the laptop on the back table, left side. I thought that was clyde.
May 20 08:56:43 <bonnie-c130>	clouds about 800 AGL over the tower, which made the (lower) overpasses fun MCR saw a bunch of clouds but it's seeing nothing but trees and snow now
May 20 08:57:10 <bonnie-c130>	stuart - larry checked the laptop and reports images recording fine - neat to watch from up here
May 20 08:58:32 <beaton>	Glad you like it. I thought it might be nice to see what's directly underneath, since you can't really look down from your seat there. 
May 20 09:14:00 <Jorgen>	Hi Larry - can you ask Britt for an ETA at JeffCo?
May 20 09:15:59 <ads-c130>	ETA is 10:30.
May 20 09:16:10 <Jorgen>	Thanx
May 20 09:47:02 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Larry, Looks like you are heading back.  Is 1030 still a good ETA?
May 20 09:50:53 <bonnie-c130>	1025 to 1030 is my best guess
May 20 09:55:54 <bonnie-c130>	lowell is now estimating 1015 - we sped up and caught a tailwind
May 20 09:59:07 <Jorgen>	OK
May 20 10:06:12 <bonnie-c130>	how many journalists are expected?  is there an ncar media person there?  if not, could you call bob or nicole?  thanks 5 minutes out from pattern
May 20 10:08:16 <Jorgen>	will do
