May 27 06:35:50 <Jorgen>	G'day C-130, is all well?
May 27 06:35:53 <birwin>	hey larry, so far so good?
May 27 06:36:48 <bonnie-c130>	all good so far, few clouds at 12.5
May 27 06:37:27 <birwin>	good news, I'll write Chris an email about the various lap top time coordination issues
May 27 06:37:55 <ads-c130>	well, I just had my discwin window just completely vanish as I was moving it off to the side.
May 27 06:38:52 <ads-c130>	It was nowhere to be found and Winds was not updating so I had to restart discwin.
May 27 06:39:05 <bonnie-c130>	Steve A - comms to PFPs worked but I accidentally powered off during the system test and now it is giving a memory error.  Could you please relay to those on the email list that it says 'Check Summ error on Sample 1 (read 2D201 should read 0)' and won't let me access any of the menus?
May 27 06:39:51 <bonnie-c130>	ps. I was able to reset the whole sample plan - hopefully we can get instructions for how to fix before the PM flight.  Thanks. Britt
May 27 06:41:48 <Jorgen>	It sounds like we really need some extra work on the winds system, but Chris and Janet are flat out on HIAPER tasks. Brandon should be available to help, but it really sounds like a Chris job.
