May 28 15:16:27 <beaton>	I have to take off now, if you could check the camera one more time in 15 minutes that would be great.
May 28 15:16:52 <beaton>	If it isn't working, the only thing I can think of would be to disable and re-eanble the camera.
May 28 15:17:28 <beaton>	Thanks for watching this for me. --Stuart--
