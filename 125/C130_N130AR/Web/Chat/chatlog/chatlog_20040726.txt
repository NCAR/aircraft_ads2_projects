Jul 26 08:54:32 <ads_>	we've seen persistent CO up around 160 the whole flight - may be picking up a distant fire plume.  Steve - if you get a chance can you run today's point backward for several days to see where this air is coming from?  Also, maybe start a point at 15000 kft as well.  Thanks!  Britt
