May 14 08:42:33 <anstett>	Is ACtracker running?

May 14 08:53:31 <Jcowan-Je>	They changed the server and the chat room that is why we could not see you guys.
May 14 08:53:49 <Jcowan-Je>	ION is up again. Problem was on outr wnd.
May 14 08:53:56 <Jcowan-Je>	thats end.

May 14 09:09:15 <Jcowan-Je>	Ta says to adjust the aparature to 11 or 16 setting.  It was set up in the hanger to 1.2.  It needs to be made smaller which is a big number.
May 14 09:09:47 <Jcowan-Je>	Ta says that you have to unscrew the set screw to change this.
May 14 09:10:07 <Jcowan-Je>	Let me know if it works.
May 14 09:10:13 <ads-c130>	did that, now ok, much better
May 14 09:10:53 <ads-c130>	the bumps not near as bad as first flight, but still not smooth 
May 14 09:11:14 <ads-c130>	at least one person sick that i know of
May 14 09:12:59 <ads-c130>	ah, about 90 minutes into flight the cmidgets altitude went oscillating again
May 14 09:13:48 <ads-c130>	but now seems somewhat better in comparison to palt
May 14 09:14:14 <Jcowan-Je>	How is the cmidgets pitch and roll?
May 14 09:16:07 <ads-c130>	roll is very difficult to tell because we were turning the airplane hard in the mountain valleys
May 14 09:17:01 <ads-c130>	pitch looked ok, but i was really watching palt vs. calt as per jorgens instructions this morning
May 14 09:18:08 <ads-c130>	whats the difference between ads packets and datagrams?
May 14 09:20:09 <ads-c130>	eta jeffco 10:30 in the pattern
May 14 09:24:00 <Jcowan-Je>	In the pattern an hour out???
May 14 09:24:42 <Jcowan-Je>	Ads packets are the number of packets sent by ADS to the ACTracker program, the datagrams are the number of packets set out the phone.
May 14 09:25:06 <Jcowan-Je>	As long as your pitch is not 30 degress it is better then last flight.
May 14 09:27:36 -->	lmurphy (lmurphy@dyn84-16.atd.ucar.edu) has joined &C130Q
May 14 09:28:31 <ads-c130>	yeah that's for sure, the approach into kremmling was much nice today, we could have landed this time, except for the fog
May 14 09:30:03 <ads-c130>	larry you there
May 14 09:30:11 <lmurphy>	yeah
May 14 09:31:06 <ads-c130>	hey did you turn on the right wing 28vdc this morning for tdl...i found it on after take off now theresa's worried it's been on for days and filled the disk before today's flight
May 14 09:31:24 <Jcowan-Je>	Bill the pitch last time was not so much the airplane as it was a mistake in the code.
May 14 09:31:47 <Jcowan-Je>	Bill the 28V was on yesterday when you and I tested the meter.  We used the MCR.
May 14 09:32:19 <lmurphy>	John said that it might have been on for some time, I did not just turn it on this morning.
May 14 09:32:26 <Jcowan-Je>	We need to find a better way to power off the TDL then to use the 50A breaker.
May 14 09:32:26 <ads-c130>	all is know for sure on cmidgets is that at some time the alt went into oscillations and then seemed to come back
May 14 09:32:57 <Jcowan-Je>	How big were the swings in alt?  1000's of feet?
May 14 09:33:24 <ads-c130>	all i remember turning on was the mcr switch at ads station...i guess the the c/b had to be on too
May 14 09:33:45 <ads-c130>	at one time tdl had a soft on switch, right
May 14 09:35:49 <lmurphy>	I believe that the soft switch does not work anymore, will have to discuss that with Teresa.
May 14 09:36:33 <ads-c130>	yes, she blew up the switch and hasn't ever repaired it back to what it was
May 14 09:36:53 <ads-c130>	she's here, easy to ask
May 14 09:37:53 <ads-c130>	we're almost directly north of grand junction 
May 14 09:38:13 <lmurphy>	That soft-switch was wired through the 9-pin connector that we left disconnected? Ask her.
May 14 09:38:46 <ads-c130>	can't right now, she's busy
May 14 09:39:23 <lmurphy>	no prob, don't worry about it. We will talk to her later.
May 14 09:41:30 <ads-c130>	she says kurt is aware of it, but she can't get to it soon i guess, although she'd be happy if we did it for her?
May 14 09:44:46 <Jcowan-Je>	They blew up the soft switch at the end of ocean waves
May 14 09:45:34 <ads-c130>	she says she can record about 2 8 hour flights, so with that in mind if her disk was empty before she put it on we had 8 hours of ground data yesterday and perhaps 5 hours so far today
May 14 09:46:04 <Jcowan-Je>	It has not been fixed yet.  I'm not sure what we want to do.  We can use the CB for a while but it is not a long term fix.
May 14 09:46:29 <ads-c130>	and the mcr uses that same 28 v also, correct
May 14 09:46:45 <Jcowan-Je>	I'm guessing that the power has been oon since they put the TDL on the plane.  TA says it was put on last week.
May 14 09:47:09 <Jcowan-Je>	Yes the MCR also uses 28V, about 16A to be exact.  Mainly for heaters.
May 14 09:47:24 <ads-c130>	well, than no data for this flight
May 14 09:48:38 <Jcowan-Je>	Ta said that she did not turn it on that day.  I really don't know at this point.  Maybe Larry remembers if the lights were on twhen they put the instrument up.
May 14 09:50:09 <ads-c130>	guess we'll find out on the ground
May 14 09:54:05 <Jcowan-Je>	Yeah, well if that is the only problem we are in good shape.
May 14 09:54:56 <ads-c130>	john, we'll need a mcr dewer fill before next flight
May 14 09:56:25 <Jcowan-Je>	Yep.  I was looking to do that about as soon as we get the plane turned around.  I gather that they are looking to go at 1330?
May 14 09:58:26 <Jcowan-Je>	I see you went to Utah and now coming back.
May 14 10:04:42 <ads-c130>	not quite utah, just grand junction
May 14 10:05:38 <ads-c130>	i think take-off is for 1:30 now, pending a check on weather upon our return
May 14 10:06:05 <ads-c130>	could be delayed for a couple of hours...then a 2 hour flight
May 14 10:06:23 <ads-c130>	just kidding, could be delayed for 30 minutes only
May 14 10:18:19 <Jcowan-Je>	Okay that sounds good.  I would prefer a 1330 but can live with a 1400.
May 14 10:23:09 <ads-c130>	we're less than 10 minutes out
