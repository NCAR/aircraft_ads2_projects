Jul 29 07:10:05 <bonnie-c130>	relatively low CO on climb out, but looks pretty hazy down below us now
Jul 29 07:18:22 <bonnie-c130>	CONCN dropped to around 200 for a few minutes on climb out (then back to 2500), but has dropped off again and been < 200 for 10 minutes (at 16.5 kft) - can somebody check with Dave Rogers to see if this could be real or if we have a low butanol or other instrument issue - thanks Britt

Jul 29 08:15:53 <aulenbac>	Correction, four times over the tower
Jul 29 08:27:52 <sean>	steve, ok.  i'm still in boulder...i'll be up at the site this afternoon...

Jul 29 09:06:11 <jeff>	How is the flight going?
Jul 29 09:08:24 <aulenbac>	C130, NOAA NESDIS/SSD detected a smoke plume crossing I-80 this morning. Did you see anything?
Jul 29 09:10:36 <jeff>	Steve,  have not heard from the chat recently--they must be looking at data!
Jul 29 09:11:49 <aulenbac>	Hi, Jeff. I'm sure thats it.
Jul 29 09:14:23 <jeff>	there are some pretty strong CN spikes at the lowest altitudes--probably due to a morning inversion rather than a plume, very clean above
Jul 29 09:15:00 <bonnie-c130>	it was pretty hazy west of the divide, and it did seem like it might be a defined layer, but CO hasn't been particularly high yet - CONCN is not completely happy, but did show a layer around 8500 on the last dip (can't have been from too far away)
Jul 29 09:15:43 <bonnie-c130>	overall, flight going very well, high respiration CO2 on the southern dips where it's green and pretty flat on the northern dips where it's brown - standby for ETAs
Jul 29 09:17:00 <jeff>	the CN spikes are reflected in well correlated spikes in the mixing ratio--suggesting that the low level moisture is associated with the aerosol
Jul 29 09:17:17 <aulenbac>	I grabbed the imagery for this afternoon's planning meeting. 
Jul 29 09:18:57 <aulenbac>	BTW, SSD now showing a detected hotspot near Carbondale.
Jul 29 09:22:27 <jeff>	note also a strong ozone decrease in the CN spikes at low altitudes--might be due to NO source below nocturnal inversion
Jul 29 09:23:19 <bonnie-c130>	at RP3, we were 8 min behind schedule, which would put us on the rollercoaster and racetrack from 11:25 to 12:15
Jul 29 09:24:20 <aulenbac>	Great, I'll pass that on to Sean and Dave.
Jul 29 09:24:59 <bonnie-c130>	steve - do you have a lat/lon for that hotspot?  We'll take a look for it on our way by - also, I believe there are websites that report any temporary flight restrictions if they are attacking it from the air
Jul 29 09:33:39 <beaton>	Britt, if you can note the time you pass over the hot spot I'll look for it in the down-looking digital camera images.
Jul 29 09:34:45 <bonnie-c130>	we're not that close . . . .about 30 miles at our closest

Jul 29 09:46:54 <aulenbac>	I'm back. Looks like it is roughly in the Cardiff area, north of Carbondale, and about 5-7 miles south of I-70.
Jul 29 09:48:17 <aulenbac>	It is not showing up on any of the other sites. Nothing on the NIFC Airspace site.
Jul 29 09:50:23 <aulenbac>	Looks as if we lost chat.

Jul 29 10:25:35 <bonnie-c130>	steve or RAF folks - any updates on the weather forecast for this afternoon re: mountain VFR fly-ability?
Jul 29 10:28:53 <allbee_Jeffco>	i am here now
Jul 29 10:29:01 <allbee_Jeffco>	what's up?
Jul 29 10:40:10 <aulenbac>	RAFers: can you answer the mountain VFR fly-ability question? I need to pull together this morning's model runs. Thanks.
Jul 29 10:46:34 <aulenbac>	Briit,
Jul 29 10:49:52 <perseus-c130>	Dave A., please get with TA or Kurt and find some butanol for the CN Counter. It will need some before the next flight. ,Larry.
Jul 29 10:50:58 <aulenbac>	Uplink to Britt (pls forward, can't get chat):
Jul 29 10:52:40 <allbee_Jeffco>	ok Larry.  I am on it.
Jul 29 10:54:56 <perseus-c130>	Thanks Dave
Jul 29 10:56:08 <allbee_Jeffco>	We found the Butanol.  Do you guys know your ETA?  Also, how is WSI working?
Jul 29 10:56:54 <aulenbac>	Satellite shows clear to west, with only scattered clouds in the extreme NW of the state. Otherwise cloud is exiting the domain to the domain to the East, CAPE (convective index) is low over the mountains reflecting low wind shear today, also cooler conditions overall. Forecast is chance t-storms 30% prob ppt. 4km WRF shows light rain possible by 21z. Eyeball nowcast shows some boundary layer Q and scattered convection but overall, the situation loo
Jul 29 10:56:54 <aulenbac>	ks as good as most PMs we have flown. The earlier forecast for pot svr wx is gone. Dave
Jul 29 10:58:41 <aulenbac>	Britt, did you get Dave's forecast?
Jul 29 11:03:48 <perseus-c130>	Radar data on WSI does not work well because of the Iridium Satcom interference. No ETA yet.
Jul 29 11:09:18 <blanc-c130>	ETA 12:10
Jul 29 11:14:04 <bonnie-c130>	thanks for the forecast - let's aim for a 2 PM takeoff and try to keep it short
Jul 29 11:15:30 <bonnie-c130>	did not catch what the "uplink to Britt" referred to 10 messages ago. . . 
Jul 29 11:18:12 <blanc-c130>	Dave A., you will also need printer paper for the next flight.
Jul 29 11:29:21 <blanc-c130>	Would someone (on the ground) please verify our chat link?
Jul 29 11:35:55 <aulenbac>	Britt, we've been zapping model compares around. Dave says: "ok, model compares look like we have a straightforward pm mission"
