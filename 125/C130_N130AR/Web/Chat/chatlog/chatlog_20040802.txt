Aug 02 11:08:01 <aulenbac>	Britt, Sean is at the tower and has seen the C130 flying around.
Aug 02 11:22:09 <ads-c130>	Just to let everybody know. At approx. 16:45 the hard disk that is normally left in the airplane filled up.  This caused winds to stop.  After several attempts we were unable to restart winds. We then tried to shut down discwin which was also unsuccessful.  We finally had to power down hercules and restart it.  We disconnected the full disc and the restart was successfull. We restarted winds and everything is now working normally. We were down for approx. 10m
