Apr 28 09:33:49 <Ron>	Hi Steve, I can see you.
Apr 28 09:34:34 <aulenbac>	/join
Apr 28 09:34:54 <aulenbac>	/join #C130Q
Apr 28 09:35:22 <Ron>	You're already here.  I'm not sure why you're not showing up in my joined list
Apr 28 09:38:30 -->	daniels (~daniels@vpn36.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Apr 28 09:38:46 <Ron>	Hi Mike!  This will be used for the ACME test flight.
Apr 28 09:40:09 <daniels>	Ron: ok, thanks.  I asked Jan if I could give a live demo during the HAC.  He said it was OK.  The reason  I am connecting in and out is that I am testing the URL links from my presentation and trying to get them right.
Apr 28 09:40:42 <Ron>	Mike, How can I get Chatzilla to see our chat channel.  It didn't know about ChatJunkiesNet, and I don't know how to set it up.
Apr 28 09:41:11 <aulenbac>	this is steve
Apr 28 09:41:21 <daniels>	hi steve
Apr 28 09:42:01 <daniels>	ron: you can go to edit preferences and set chatzilla to automatically connect to syrah.atd.ucar.edu and the #C130Q chat channel
Apr 28 09:42:31 <daniels>	your can also try this:  irc://syrah.atd.ucar.edu/c130q and just click on this link once you've set your nickname.
Apr 28 09:43:16 <daniels>	ron, does this help?
Apr 28 09:46:28 <daniels>	are  your there?
Apr 28 09:46:34 <daniels>	i mean you
Apr 28 09:46:56 <Ron>	Yes

Apr 28 09:48:16 <RLR>	Here I am on chatzilla!
Apr 28 09:48:43 <Ron>	Nice to see how this works!
Apr 28 09:50:28 <RLR>	Bye from chatzilla
Apr 28 09:51:21 <--	RLR has quit (ChatZilla 0.9.52B [Mozilla rv:1.6/20040113])
Apr 28 09:51:37 <aulenbac>	this is steve
Apr 28 09:51:41 <daniels>	hi steve
Apr 28 09:52:07 <aulenbac>	hi mike. ron and i are testing out a few chat clients
Apr 28 09:53:04 <daniels>	that's good.  I think xchat is a pretty good one (ron probably mentioned that, right).  I've tried mirc and a few others, too.  Which ones have you tried?
Apr 28 09:55:22 <aulenbac>	we're working with chatzilla (mac and linux), tried fire (mac) without success. I think it was going through an IM protocol but i really don't know enough how all this works to be sure.
Apr 28 09:56:36 <daniels>	www.xchat.org is where you can get the xchat client, btw.  There is also a Mac OSX version.
Apr 28 09:56:48 <Ron>	Mike, Steve's even newer at this than I.  I've used the PostNuke, Xchat and now ChatZilla.  Strange that ChatZilla doesn't seem to have a way to just open a channel.  To get it to work I had to go to the Preferences and set up syrah/#C130Q, exit and restart ChatZilla.
Apr 28 09:57:33 <daniels>	Ron, as I said, I did try about 4 or 5 different clients back in the BAMEX days and xchat was the best of that bunch.
Apr 28 09:58:11 <daniels>	but I'm always interested in hearing about new stuff ;-)
Apr 28 09:58:17 <Ron>	Mike, I do like xchat.  Have you seen the new hangar construction photos?
Apr 28 09:58:45 <daniels>	not yet.  I'm here in the hac meeting and gerry will be showing them to us this afternoon.  i hear all the framing is up.
Apr 28 09:59:10 <daniels>	any walls yet?
Apr 28 09:59:40 <aulenbac>	any idea how to chat with netscape 7.x?
Apr 28 10:00:11 <aulenbac>	David Baker and I are trying to get him up and running on the default CGD browser, netcape
Apr 28 10:00:27 <daniels>	steve.  not sure if chatzilla is part of netscape 7.x, but you could always use the Java applet through the postnuke web site.
Apr 28 10:00:40 <daniels>	ron can post the url
Apr 28 10:00:52 <Ron>	Some of the framing is up.  No walls.  They started from the north side.  They've added some horizontal support structure, but most of it is the larger vertical beams.
Apr 28 10:02:17 <Ron>	The only thing about the PostNuke chat is that it's available only to registered users.  (I can add them as necessary.)
Apr 28 10:02:43 <daniels>	steve, are you up on the mesa?  or at jeffco?
Apr 28 10:03:13 <Ron>	The only PostNuke site that is "active" now is http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/OW/  (Be sure to use the trailing <slash>!)
Apr 28 10:03:57 <aulenbac>	i'm at the mesa
Apr 28 10:04:50 <aulenbac>	i'm pointing david baker to the url. he sees it. what's next?
Apr 28 10:05:01 <daniels>	what does he "see"
Apr 28 10:05:14 <daniels>	we don't see him in the chatroom yet
Apr 28 10:05:28 <aulenbac>	where does he go for chat
Apr 28 10:05:41 <daniels>	ok, ron can take it from here -- he needs an account now, right?!?!
Apr 28 10:06:05 <aulenbac>	x1306 is David's extension, ron
Apr 28 10:06:17 <Ron>	He needs to be a registered user, so the first thing would be to go to the "create one" link.  After that I'll have to approve him/her for access to the chat.
Apr 28 10:08:34 <daniels>	ron, do you know how long today's test flight is planned to be?
Apr 28 10:08:44 <Ron>	I think about 2 hours.
Apr 28 10:09:50 <daniels>	ok, fyi, my presentation to the hac is scheduled to happen between 130p and 210p as per the agenda
Apr 28 10:10:51 <daniels>	i will update people of the EXACT time as i know it, but i hope everyone can say hi to the HAC live

Apr 28 10:12:56 <aulenbac>	looks like ron got david in the chat
Apr 28 10:13:21 <daniels>	great, i assume he's dfb

Apr 28 10:13:36 <aulenbac>	yep, that's his login
Apr 28 10:14:35 <aulenbac>	mike, what's the HAC and when you say everyone, do you want to us groundhuggers to join in?
Apr 28 10:14:42 <daniels>	everybody: just so you know, I am planning to give a presentation to the HIAPER Advisory Committee (HAC), including some NSF mucky mucks, Tim Killeen and Larry Winter.  I hope everybody is as talkative as possible!
Apr 28 10:15:07 <ruth>	bye'
Apr 28 10:15:12 <--	ruth has quit (CGI:IRC)
Apr 28 10:15:29 <daniels>	i want to take an opportunity to demonstrate a live chat for the hiaper group, but in no way want to interfere with c130 ops

Apr 28 10:27:54 <daniels>	ron, can you give me the url for live ion data for this flight?
Apr 28 10:28:35 <Ron>	If they can get the Sat phone up and running, the URL will be:
Apr 28 10:28:39 <Ron>	http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/cgi-bin/ion/ion-p?page=c130.ion
Apr 28 10:29:10 <Ron>	At this time, this URL shows the last Ocean Waves flight on 3 March 2004.
Apr 28 10:29:24 <daniels>	ok, then i had the correct one, thx
Apr 28 10:30:11 <aulenbac>	mike and ron,  i've also updated the ACME Swiki with that link if you want to show off collaborative technology
Apr 28 10:31:48 <aulenbac>	http://swiki.ucar.edu/acme/44
Apr 28 10:33:15 <daniels>	steve: thanks, actually we have used the postnuke package for this on the past several projects and it's the only one i'm comfortable navigating through at this time in front of all these people ;-)  -- i plan to take a look at your acme swiki implementation later in the project, though!
Apr 28 10:33:51 <aulenbac>	no prob -- its there iff you want it.
Apr 28 10:34:31 <aulenbac>	yesterday's meeting notes are at: http://swiki.ucar.edu/acme/36
Apr 28 10:35:53 <Ron>	Steve, How do I get the the C-130 link from the ACME home page?  I had to go to "recent changes" to get there.
Apr 28 10:36:55 <Ron>	C-130Q is now on the tarmac.  No power yet.
Apr 28 10:45:55 <aulenbac>	use the /44
Apr 28 10:46:16 <aulenbac>	I hope to get the swiki navBar updated today or tomorrow
Apr 28 10:48:27 <aulenbac>	david, are you still there?

Apr 28 11:11:50 <baker>	dave here
Apr 28 11:13:54 <daniels>	ads: but, of course ;-)
Apr 28 11:15:10 <aulenbac>	so, please educate a novice -- do we have a protocol to follow?
Apr 28 11:15:31 <daniels>	did you hear that I may be doing another live dog and pony show this afternoon along with the HIAPER Advisory Committee?!?!  I'm due to give a presentation from 130p-210p, so I hope you are still flying!
Apr 28 11:16:38 <aulenbac>	actually, what is your flight plan for today? Are you doing a Niwot pattern? 
Apr 28 11:17:10 <daniels>	steve, i would just not type too much if you see lots of activity.  test flights are for fixing instrument problems and that's the number 1 priority.  I imagine the RAF technicians/project manager will tell us to stop chatting if we are interfering.
Apr 28 11:17:44 <daniels>	one can never plan what actuially happens 'on the flight...
Apr 28 11:18:21 <aulenbac>	mike, thanks.
Apr 28 11:19:13 <ads>	hello\
Apr 28 11:20:01 <aulenbac>	steve here

Apr 28 11:22:06 <daniels>	he is supposed to be giving a presentation along with me but there is no sign of him.
Apr 28 11:28:20 <Ron>	Chris is not on the manifest.
Apr 28 11:28:30 <daniels>	is he at jeffco?
Apr 28 11:28:47 <beaton>	He was on the airplane a few minutes ago
Apr 28 11:30:08 <daniels>	ok, thx stuart
Apr 28 11:30:52 <ads>	hi steve - same as planned but without the sawtooth - going straight to Kremmling after take off then straight to one racetrack and one rollercoaster - Brit
Apr 28 11:31:27 <ads>	steve - also check out the ion link from the raf page for realtime data and location - Britt\
Apr 28 11:39:35 <aulenbac>	shall do

Apr 28 12:14:10 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Yeah, He said that he was not worried about the WSI since we had a good ground check.  He recommended unplugging the GPS and then try it, but I think it is best to wait until you get back.
