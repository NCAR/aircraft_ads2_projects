Everyone:

It is now official.  The ACME C-130 project will be supported next year.
A total of 54 flight hours have been allocated with flight support based
out of JeffCO between 1 April and 1 August.  Maintenance and other
infrastructure activities will have to be scheduled around the ongoing
flights.  We can expect to fly roughly 12 four hour flights during the 
16 week interval. Instrumentation includes the standard RAF sensor
package plus the lyman-alpha and the full range of RAF chemistry 
measurements.  Only one User system, the previously deployed whole gas
sampling suitcases.

Steve or Ron - can we set up an ACME email distribution address?

Jorgen -

from back to front, here are the leads:

MCR - Mark Tschudi RAF
DigiCam - Stuart Beaton RAF
CO2, CO, O3, and TDL H2O - Teresa Campos RAF
U. Utah flasks, MEDUSA (RAF) Sampler - Britt Stephens RAF and Chun-Ta 
Lai U. Utah (lai@biology.utah.edu)
CMDL Flask Packages - Britt Stephens RAF
SIO Flask Rack - Britt Stephens RAF and Heather Graven, SIO 
(hgraven@ucsd.edu)
PTRMS - Alex Guenther ACD (guenther@ucar.edu) and Thomas Karl ACD 
(tomkarl@ucar.edu)
CN Counter - ?? RAF
CVI hard drive shakedown - Errol Korn and Cindy Twohy

other non-RAFers who will fly include Dave Schimel (CGD) and several CU 
students.  If you'd rather not load all 19 seats let me know and I can 
try to come up with a more accurate tally. 

The CMDL suitcases will most likely only be on for July.  The PTRMS rack 
may not be ready to go on until after the first few research flights.  
The rack is 22" by 44" by 44" and 200-250 lbs, so hopefully it can fit 
past other stuff.  The rack will not be on for the July flights, 
vacating that space for Errol and Cindy.  I believe that Chun-Ta will be 
showing up to load the MEDUSA sampler on Monday morning the 19th.  
Heather Graven's SIO sampler involves minimal hardware (one rack mounted 
plate) and she will arrive around the 21st to install it.

Thanks,
Britt

Ron and Britt, let's talk about it a bit first. My experience is they 
are so-so for announcements and really bad for active projects. People 
just don't read email as much these days and they certainly don't 
manage the information embedded in it very well. The recent plots sent 
by email are a good example.Tools like the swiki actually provide a 
searchable record that everyone can access and an archive that everyone 
can use.

Ron, you're on the DMWG (swiki) and the GAG (email). Can you and I 
(Britt, you too if you have time) get together early next week and talk 
about this and those C-130 chat accounts? I'd like to run some ideas by 
you and get your take on appropriate solutions for ACME.

Steve

It would be very good for us to discuss this.  I have commitments Monday
afternoon and Tuesday morning but otherwise am available.  I spend Tuesdays
at FL-1 if that makes things easier for you.

We need an outside accessible chat server to prepare for projects like

We need to discuss this with Santiago.  I see no reason that we can't 
work on the new irc server (with outside access) at the same time the 
old one is still running.  But I need to discuss this with him and you.

Propose a meeting to discuss this in MM (I am very busy, but there are

Thanks for bringing this up,

Ron,

the IRC server will soon be taken down to make way for a new one which 
Mike has requested. I would not advertise it ouside of ATD since it may 
be down in between field projects.

Santiago,

Is the IRC chat (pircd) daemon on syrah available only within ATD or is it
visible within UCAR?  I ask this because the ACME project wants chat, and
everyone who will want to use it has a gatekeeper password.  It will save
me a bit of work if I don't have to set up an entire PostNuke web site for
the project if it's only going to be used for chat by people who can gain
access to the #C130Q chat channel via xchat or browser.  (Alas, I may have
to set it up later if a truly outside user/participant needs chat access.)

Thanks.

Ron

Mike,

I've been asked to set up on-line chat for the ACME project.  When I asked
Santiago about it on Monday:
   "Is the IRC chat (pircd) daemon on syrah available only within ATD or is
    it visible within UCAR?  I ask this because the ACME project wants chat,
    and everyone who will want to use it has a gatekeeper password.  It will
    save me a bit of work if I don't have to set up an entire PostNuke web
    site for the project if it's only going to be used for chat by people
    who can gain access to the #C130Q chat channel via xchat or browser.
    (Alas, I may have to set it up later if a truly outside user/participant
    needs chat access.)

  he replied:
   "the IRC server will soon be taken down to make way for a new one which
    Mike has requested. I would not advertise it outside of ATD since it
    may be down in between field projects."

 From what Britt told me, virtually everyone who would be chatting has an
NCAR gatekeeper login.  This implies to me that they all have local logins.
So, on syrah where our chat is presently located, can someone from within
NCAR run a chat client and access it, or is it just within ATD?

If I set up a PostNuke chat, then I also have to maintain an authorized
user (participant) list, so they can use it.  I don't mind doing this if
I have to.

I know you have plans to move chat to a different machine, but I don't
know the time line.  The ACME project officially begins on May day, but
I'm sure they will want to try it out well before then when they are
uploading and doing test flights.

How do you suggest I proceed?  Santiago seemed to defer to you.  I wanted
to get together with you yesterday, but we never were able to connect.

Steve,

Attached is a file (mostly HTML but with some comments) with the
weather-link table we used for some real-time web sites.  I actually
took time to see that all of these are still working (except for the
two CIRA loop downloads).  I also added some links that we have used
at times but are not present on all our project pages.

RAF's home page URL is:
    http://raf.atd.ucar.edu

The URL for the "C-130 Real-Time Data via ION" link is:
    http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/cgi-bin/ion/ion-p?page=c130.ion

I plan to add the ACME swiki link to both the "What's New" and the
"Field Projects" areas of our home page.  When do you think I should
add those?  (I haven't gotten any verbage from Britt yet, but, as you
can see if you go to our home page, I don't want a lot of text there.)

Let me know if there's anything else you need.

Ron

NCAR Aircraft, Ground Instruments to Track Carbon Dioxide Uptake
along Colorado's Drought-Plagued Front Range

BOULDER--The National Center for Atmospheric Research will fly a C-130
research aircraft over Colorado's Front Range this May and July to
measure how much carbon dioxide mountain forests remove from the air
as spring turns into summer. NCAR scientists and their university
colleagues are developing new methods for assessing carbon uptake over
complex terrain on regional scales.  Accurate assessments could help
show to what extent carbon dioxide storage in Western mountain forests--
a potentially important "sink" for the greenhouse gas--may be slowing
down as the ongoing drought affects tree growth.

International pressure is mounting to limit carbon emissions because
of their role in global climate change. Better understanding of
natural processes involved in forest-air carbon exchange may lead to
more accurate monitoring methods and new ways to enhance carbon
uptake. High carbon-emitting nations and industries are interested
in devising strategies for meeting quotas and trading carbon credits.

ACME (short for the Airborne Carbon in the Mountains Experiment) gives
scientists an opportunity to combine airborne data with ground-based
measurements for the first time to paint a more accurate picture of
carbon exchanges in rolling hills and mountain ranges. Results from
the field program will also be used in testing computer models of forest
ecosystem function.  The models will help scientists understand the
response of forests to drought, fire, insects, and climate change.

Local researchers are especially interested in a side trip to assess
forest-air exchange over the 150,000-acre Hayman fire burn area.

"Wildfires play a big role in controlling vegetation and carbon
exchange in the Rockies," says NCAR scientist Dave Schimel, "but most
burn areas are too small to assess from an aircraft.  For the first
time we have a chance to get airborne measurements of carbon directly
over a large, disturbed area."

Forest losses during the 2002 wildfire season in Colorado reversed
years of carbon uptake. The amount of carbon dioxide released from
trees during the fires equaled an entire year's emissions from
statewide transportation activities.

As the research plane samples air aloft, a dense network of instruments
will gather data over a half square mile on Niwot Ridge near
Nederland. Perched atop three steel towers provided by NCAR, each between
100 and 200 feet tall, carbon dioxide sensors and sonic anemometers will
measure changes in carbon levels and winds high above the tree tops.

"Today we usually look for carbon in all the wrong places,” says Schimel,
"focusing on where it's easy to measure rather than where fluxes are
largest.” Most current studies are in flat areas, but most western
forests are in the mountains, he explains. Schimel and colleagues have
estimated that 25-50% of U.S. carbon uptake occurs in mountainous terrain.

In the northern midlatitudes, significant carbon uptake occurs in
forests, which are typically left to grow undisturbed in mountainous
regions. Ground-based sensors work well in flat land: there are 200
such sites around the world.  But in mountain ranges special conditions,
such as turbulent airflow, snow pack, vegetation patterns, and contrasts
in sunshine and shade, complicate data gathering.

The National Science Foundation, NCAR's primary sponsor and owner of
the C-130 aircraft, is funding the project.  The universities of Colorado,
Florida, and Utah, Colorado State University, and Scripps Institution of
Oceanography are participating, along with NCAR.

C-130 Flight Schedule and Paths

Heading out at sunrise from Jefferson County Airport, the C-130 will
travel along a 30-mile arm from Winter Park east to Longmont and
around a 71-mile oval loop from Idaho Springs north to Allenspark (see
map), carrying a belly full of specialized instruments. The aircraft
will retrace the pattern again between 2:00 and 4:00 p.m. the same
day, flying as low as 1,000 feet above the ground in some places and
rising to 16,500 feet in others. The pilots expect to fly four or five
days in May and the same number in July.  They will also head south to
the Hayman burn area southwest of Denver once in May and once in July.


Background: Carbon Emission and Storage

Human activities put eight billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere
each year--six billion from fossil fuel burning and another two
billion from forest destruction. But monitors show only half that much
building up in the planet's atmosphere.  The other four billion
tons are removed each year by growing vegetation and ocean waters.

The United States alone is responsible for 20%, over 1.5 billion tons,
of the global total carbon output.  But U.S. forests may remove as
much as a half to a billion tons a year naturally as trees grow back
on abandoned farmland, spread over historical grasslands, or grow
thick with underbrush protected from wildfires, according to NCAR
scientist Britton Stephens. Understanding these removal processes better,
along with more accurate monitoring, could lead to new methods for
enhancing carbon uptake, he adds.

Foundation.

Hi Ron,
Awhile ago we talked about getting all of the IDEAS weather links 
transferred over to the ACME page, and also about archiving certain 
images on flight days.  Can you tell me if anything has been done on 
this?  If not, could you please point me to the IDEAS page and I will 
link it from the swiki so that we can access it during our meeting at 3 
PM today.  Thanks a lot,
Britt

Ron,

Looks great. There is a typo and a broken link on "Latest Regional IR"

Do you have time to discuss a data wrangling methodology (WRF output -> 
subset netCDF -> translater to ARL format -> ingest into STILT model 
for operational planning) today?

Cheers,
Steve

looks great thanks!

if you have time today, could you please add links to prognostic charts, 
such as
http://adds.aviationweather.noaa.gov/progs/
http://www.rap.ucar.edu/weather/progs/

and to the Tundra Cam at Niwot Ridge
http://instaar.colorado.edu/tundracamII/

also, the RAMS links don't seem to be fully functional - maybe they're 
out of date but could be updated

Dave - see http://swiki.ucar.edu/acme/38 and please make changes your 
self or suggestions to me and Ron.

Ron,

I know you're busy. Great if you can attend today but if you can't we 
can talk about this outside of the meeting, too.

I added the above, but I'm hoping that someone can take over making
further additions.

Britt,

I just checked out those links, and it looks like CSU is doing a major
revision of their system.  I'll leave those alone for now, perhaps
deactivating the links for now.

Hi All,

Thanks to the many staff who have contributed to the preparation of the 
C-130 for ACME. The first test flight is planned for tomorrow, Tuesday 
27 April 2004, at noon. Tomorrow morning we can finalize the RAF crew 
and also the roll-out time for the aircraft. The science crew will meet 
at 10 AM for a planning session in the conference room.

Thanks again, Jorgen

Tentative plans, based on weather and testing needs, are for a second 
test flight, focussing on wind and pressure calibrations in smooth air, 
either Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning and our first research 
flights either Wednesday or Thursday.

Look to Channel 4 news at 6 tonight for an interview with our fearless 
leader.  Post, RMN, and Camera may have articles tomorrow as well.

Britt

Preliminary data from test flight 1 can be anon ftp'd from 
rafsmb.atd.ucar.edu /pub/temp/users/stephens as a netcdf file
125newtf01.nc
the parameters are described in the word file in the same directory
125.parameters.doc
I've filled in a few of the special user parameters but a few more still 
need to be described.  CO data is still being worked up.

Britt,

Thanks for doing this.  This server (rafsmb.atd.ucar.edu) is behind the
firewall, so it's only available within NCAR, so far as I know.

I normally post these data on the ATD ftp site (ftp.atd.ucar.edu), but I
didn't know they were ready.  Do you want to handle RAF's preliminary netCDF
file distribution?

Steve and I have been talking about how to create links to preliminary
data, so I'm sure we'll post them to the appropriate ACME swiki web page.

Ron

The second test flight went well, although the winds were not as stable 
as hoped for the P corrections - we'll likely have to do another flight 
later in the campaign.  Data from the first two test flights are now on 
an RAF ftp site:
ftp://ftp.atd.ucar.edu/pub/archive/RAF-projects/ACME

Both weather and instrumentation factors are pointing to Thursday as the 
ideal day for our first research flights.  It should be mostly sunny 
with winds at 12 kft forecast ~ 20 kts as opposed to over 40 for the 
first test flight.  Peak CO2 ventilation in May 2001 
(http://swiki.ucar.edu/acme/39) was at 8 AM MDT, so I would suggest a 
6:30 AM take-off which would put us on the racetrack from 7:30-8:30, and 
Rollercoaster from 8:30-9:15.  If this afternoon is typical, the cloud 
bases will be around 15 kft, which could require some inflight 
modifications to the PM plan. 

There will be two more safety briefings this week, to accomodate the few 
folks who missed last week and some journalists who want to fly.  We 
will not schedule any more this month so please attend one of these if 
you plan to fly in May.  They will take 1 hour 15 minutes and are at RAF on
Wednesday May 5 at 2 PM and
Friday May 7 at 10 AM.

All for now.
Britt

Hi All,

A 2-hour test flight is scheduled for Monday Morning in order to test 
that the wind measurements etc. are OK.

9:00      Aircraft out
11:00   Take-off

Duration 2-2.5 hrs.

The flight area will be some distance off the mountains in eastern 
Colorado. 

For project people, please let me know by 9 AM if you desire to be 
onboard the flight.

Thanks, Jorgen X1028

Britt,

Do we have a formal data use policy? If so, send it to me and I'll get 
it posted to both the mail list and the swiki.

Also, Jielun and I were just talking about it in the context of 
cranking out some quick-look products. What is appropriate for both the 
ACME project and RAF operations? Specifically, do we have a "who, what, 
when and where" established? I'd be glad to help if needed.

Thanks,

Dear All,

Unfortunately, the CO2 and CO instruments are still not flight ready.  
The big picture is that we have plenty of time in May and July to use 
our 50 hours, things are just getting going in terms of forest CO2 
uptake, and both of these measurements are critical to our mission so we 
want to take our time and be sure they are working properly before we fly. 

The details are that in our flight and ground testing we have noticed a 
problem in the CO2 instrument drying system.  It is important to note 
that this system was designed to handle relatively low flow rates, but 
we decided to try to run the instrument in a high-flow fast-response 
mode to look at convective signals.  We are modifying the drying system 
and continue to evaluate whether we will revert to the low-flow mode.  
We are also having software difficulties which make diagnosing problems 
and validating performance very difficult.  We are hoping to address 
this problem as well.  The CO instrument is in good shape, but showed 
some inconsistent calibration responses on the first test flight that we 
want to look at.  A combination of software problems and time devoted to 
CO2 have so far kept us from doing so. 

I want to stress that these measurements are very challenging and 
hiccups such as these are not unexpected.  Teresa and Steve have been 
working extremely hard and continue to put in long hours to get these 
(and the TDL hygrometer, the TECO ozone analyzer, and the fast-response 
ozone analyzer) on the plane and running.  I am confident that they will 
resolve the remaining issues and that we will have state-of-the-art 
precision and accuracy for all the chemistry instruments very soon.  
Thank you for your patience.

Britt

If weather and instruments cooperate, our next flight day will be 
Tuesday.  The forecast is for windy, but it's probably too far out to 
worry about just yet. 

The Harvard group is currently in Laramie integrating their instruments, 
including CO2 and CO, on the King Air for the COBRA-Maine campaign.  We 
are discussing the possibility of doing an inflight comparison next week 
before they head east on Friday.  This would likely involve meeting up 
somewhere east of the mountains for 15-30 minutes of formation flying.  
We might also try to combine this flight with the remaining 
wind/pressure calibration legs that Jorgen has planned, in which case we 
would want to go in the morning to get more than one level above the 
boundary-layer.  We could also consider leaving an hour early for our 
afternoon flight and doing the comparisons then, though this would not 
be our first choice.

So the most-likely scenarios for next week are:
1) Morning and afternoon flight day Tuesday or Wednesday with an 
intercomparison flight on Wednesday or Thursday.
2) Morning and afternoon flight day Thursday including an 
intercomparison on the afternoon flight.
3) Morning and afternoon flight day on Friday.

Britt

Dear All,

We are still chasing down problems with the CO2 and CO instrumentation.  
There is a chance they will be fixed this afternoon, but not in time to 
verify well enough for a research mission.  Therefore, we will not fly 
tomorrow. 

The weather on Friday looks as good or better than tomorrow.  We will 
make another go/no-go decision early tomorrow afternoon.  If it is a go, 
we will fly from 6:30-10:30 AM and 2-4 PM on Friday. 

The instrumentation readiness and flight planning meeting originally 
scheduled for 3:30 today has been moved to 3:30 tomorrow.

If we do fly on Friday, the safety briefing currently planned for 10:30 
AM will have to be rescheduled.

Thanks for your patience,
Britt

High winds are forecast over the mountains tomorrow with calmer 
conditions on Wednesday, and we could use the extra day to work on 
instrumentation, so we will not fly tomorrow and will plan for two 
flights on Wednesday.  If the instruments look good in the morning, on 
the afternoon flight we will meet up with the King Air to do a CO2 and 
CO intercomparison either before or after our mountain legs.  The RAF 
flight planning meeting scheduled for today at 3:30 has been moved to 
tomorrow at 3:30.
Britt

Thanks all for your patience.  There is a good chance we will have fully 
operational instruments by the end of the day today, but because there 
doesn't seem to be anything magical about tomorrow's weather 
(possibility of rain and a wide range in predicted transport across 
models) we decided to not push it.  We will still have a planning 
meeting from 3:30-4:30 at RAF today, as it's been awhile since we've met 
in person and we should discuss Thursday and Friday flight options.  We 
may try to intercompare with the King Air instruments when they're back 
from Maine in a month or two.
Britt

The nowcast calls for snow and rain the mountains, though the tundra 
cam looks fine, just high clouds.  It did snow in Silverthorne/A basin 
yesterday.  I mention this to calibrate yesterday's forecast (which 
suggested worse weather than we're having).  So-tomorrow, looks like 
cloudy, rainy, winds generally from the west at less than 15 knots 
aloft.  Friday looks perfect.  All progs show no clouds, winds <15 
knots .  Notably, the mess we had yesterday shows pretty clearly on the 
progs and satellite loops, As of Friday, there is no weather to our 
west and this system of disturbances should have moved off cleanly to 
the east.  The regional discussion backs this up-tomorrow will be 
marginal, Friday should be perfect. Given the drying forecast, they are 
calling for rain and tstorms in thurs PM, but only isolated mountain 
convection on Friday.  If we were desperate, I'd go for Thurs but if 
there are any lingering doubts Friday might be better, or if we want to 
think through and implement software changes.

 I'll meet with Jielun and Morris Weisman this AM and then call Roger 
Pielke mid-day and we can make a go/no go mid-day.  In any case I will 
come over to Jefco around 8 this AM and load flasks,

The current assessment is that Thurs is out, high winds, precip and 
strong upslope flow.  Morris Wesiman however felt we had a 75 % chance 
of good conditions (low winds, few clouds, no upslope component) on 
Friday.  Will update thursday AM for a go/no go at 130 PM on Thurs.  Go 
on Thurs 130 means all flight personnel plus Steve Aulenbach meet at 
Jefco around 430 AM.

 I'll meet with Jielun and Morris Weisman this AM and then call Roger 

Pielke mid-day and we can make a go/no go mid-day.  In any case I will 

come over to Jefco around 8 this AM and load flasks,


Dave

Dear All, 
Weather and instrumentation are favorable for flights tomorrow.  We will 
take off at 0630 MDT for a 4 hour flight and at 1330 for a 2 hour 
flight.  All onboard science crew should be at RAF ready to go by 0530 
at the latest.  We will have a final weather review at 0500 for those 
interested.  We will operate the CO2 instrument in a 1-sec response mode 
until we resolve the drying issues at higher flow rates, which could 
happen as soon as early next week.  Given the nature of complex 
instrumentation and that this is our first full flight, there is always 
a chance of a last-minute scrub.  I apologize in advance if this 
happens, but as of now everything is a go.  See you bright and early,
Britt

Dave and others,
Please take a look at what was archived for COBRA
http://people.deas.harvard.edu/~johnlin/
and what is linked from our web page
http://swiki.ucar.edu/acme/38
and come up with a list of things that we should be saving on flight 
days.  Then we need to talk about whether we can set up scripts to save 
this stuff automatically or if we need to task someone to do it 
manually.  For this week it probably has to be manual in either case.
Britt

Just a quick note between flights - our first research flight went very 
well with cooperating instruments and relatively smooth air allowing 
low-level operations.  We observed high CO2 near the ground ~ 0700 near 
Kremmling and low CO2 near the ground on our last dip at ~ 1015.  We 
will head out again at 1330 for two hours.  Still a few instrumentation 
issues to work on before next week, but the data look good.
Britt

To all,

The IRC (chat) has been moved from syrah to a new, dedicated, exposed
machine which is also accessible from outside NCAR's firewall.  Here's
the info needed for you to join.

             Group:  ChatJunkiesNet                          (if needed)
       server name:  rdcc.guest.ucar.edu (128.117.43.104)
              port:  6667                                      (default)
           channel:  &C130Q                  (note ampersand, not pound)
  password/keyword:  60kw60E08p

If you set up Mozilla's Chatzilla via the "edit" menu, when you have
completed it, I recommend exiting the browser completely and restarting.
Also, keep the password handy, because Mozilla doesn't keep it.  On the
other hand, if you are using Xchat, once you set up the channel, it will
take care of things for you automatically.

If you are having troubles, please let me know.

Clouds had closed in on the mountains by the time we took off, so we 
were unable to fly the mission as planned.  However, Henry and Lowell 
were able to get us up through the clouds to profile to 17.5 kft and 
relatively close to the tower under the cloud deck.  It's likely we flew 
through air that was close to where we flew this morning, and the dense 
cloud conditions will be a good complement to hopefully sunnier flights 
later.  We will have a preliminary data review and flight planning 
meeting at RAF at 1100 on Tuesday, with the first possible next flight 
day Wednesday.

Dave, Steve, Bill - I know everyone was swamped today, but did anyone 
happen to think of archiving any met/satellite products?  Maybe Monday 
is not too late?  Thanks for all your hard work,

Britt (et al.),

The RUC, MM5 15km, and ETA 12km forecasts that are being used for flight 
planning are being automatically archived every day (though I don't know 
if this is the sort of met data you're referring to).

Britt and Steve,

I just edited the ACME Weather Links page.  See what you think.

Britt,

I added the above, but I'm hoping that someone can take over making
further additions.

Britt,

I just checked out those links, and it looks like CSU is doing a major
revision of their system.  I'll leave those alone for now, perhaps
deactivating the links for now.

Britt,

I get the impression you and/or Steve would like me to attend this afternoon's
3:00 p.m. meeting.  Yes?

Ron

Hi,

fyi---there are also some photos of the forest near the CU tower from
last friday at:

  http://urquell.colorado.edu/photos/photos_040514.html

on Friday morning there was about a foot of fresh snow on the ground.
i was at the top of the CU tower trying to get a photo of the
c130...on the leg i was up there (around 8am?) the c130 was a bit too
high to get a good photo (considering the camera i'm using).

more photos from the CU ameriflux site are available at:

  http://urquell.colorado.edu/calendar/

We are planning an 0630 takeoff tomorrow morning for a 4 hour flight and 
a 1330-1400 takeoff tomorrow afternoon for a 2 hour flight.  Conditions 
look similar to last Friday's flight, with morning fog and afternoon 
thunderstorms a possibility.  The morning flight plan will be very 
similar to last week's but we will go more to to the southwest for the 
last sawtooth.  In the afternoon we will try as planned before, with the 
possibility of filing IFR if necessary to get west of the divide.  
Science crew should be ready to go by 0530 and includes
Stephens
Graven
Schimel
Sacks
Campos
Rochester
Baker
For the afternoon flight Shertz replaces Rochester.  There may also be 
up to 4 journalists on each of the flights tomorrow.  See you bright and 
early.
Britt

Heather has put together the flown times, lats, lons, and alts for the 
RF01 and RF02 waypoints and I have posted them to the swiki 
(http://swiki.ucar.edu/acme/44).  This should help in pulling out 
racetracks and profiles.

Great flight this morning.  CO2, CO, and all other instruments appeared 
to be working well, and operations were smooth even though the air 
sometimes wasn't.  We will take-off again between 1330 and 1400 for a 
2-2.5 hr. flight.  Off to to planet now.
Britt

I am not running this email list, so I forwarded your request to
Steve Aulenbach, who, I think, is.

The weather tomorrow looks a lot like during our last two flights with 
questionable conditions in the afternoon, and Thursday looks very good 
so we'll hold off and plan for Thursday.  0630 takeoff for 4 hrs and 
1330 takeoff for 2 hrs.  The afternoon flight will include a missed 
approach at Centennial to sample the Denver plume.  All those planning 
to fly please let me know by midday tomorrow.
Britt

Mark and Britt,
Images from TF01, RF01, and RF02 are available in directories under 
vivaldi:/scr/jscience/beaton/Acme/. The full-res (704x480) images are 
in the flight directories from this location. They are named as 
c130_down_date_time.jpg.
The de-interlaced (352x240) images with time, alt, lat, long, pitch, 
and heading annotations are in the AnnotatedImages directory.
MPEG4 movies from the small images are in the Movies directory. These 
are readable with Quicktime or VLC or mplayer, variously available for 
windows, linux, mac, etc.

I'll try to get the images from each days flight into this location 
within a day or two.

The morning flight went well, despite high winds over the mountains.  
Bill Sacks said it was "a little bumpy" but others might question his 
calibration.  Unfortunately the elevator trim motor failed during the 
flight and the repairs are not yet complete so we have had to cancel the 
afternoon flight.  There are several things we would like to do with an 
afternoon flight before the end of phase I, including some low-level 
flying in the vicinity of Niwot Ridge and a Denver plume study.  We will 
tentatively plan for a 2 hour flight taking off at 1400 tomorrow.  Based 
on aircraft readiness and weather, we will make a final go/no-go 
decision by 1100 tomorrow.

This afternoon's flight went very well and all objectives were met.  We 
collected 16 U. Utah flasks, 17 CMDL flasks, and 5 SIO flasks on a 
descent over Denver.  The dark brown layer visible this morning had 
dissipated, but we still saw CO over 200.  We have a lot of scientific 
and diagnostic data to pour over next month in preparation for the July 
flights.  We will organize a science meeting later next week to discuss 
results to date and future plans.  Our first July flight day will be the 
7th, 8th, or 9th, and then we will do approximately 4 more flight days 
the following three weeks.  Thanks to everyone, and particularly our 
dawn-patrol modelers and steel-stomached flight crews, for all the hard 
work. 
Britt

Thanks also to everyone-a fantastic effort and a very exciting 
experiment.  Special thanks to Teresa, Steve, and Britt for incredible 
work on instrumentation and also special thanks to Bill, and Dave B for 
enthusiastic modeler participation in a field program!  Lets all get 
some sleep and then dive into the data to recycle our ideas and 
enthusiasm for the July program.

Hey, welcome back! Hope you had a great vacation. Thanks for the info. 
I'll use it in some code I'm crafting to retrieve actual versus planned 
waypoints, times, distances, etc. from the RF files. Are the netCDF 
files on the ftp site 'final'? I'm assuming they are not but it doesn't 
hurt to ask.

Speaking of netCDF, did you see Russ Rew's posting on his recent trip 
to ESRI?

Steve

Steve,

In reply to your phone message last month, the position measurements
to use are:
    LATC, LONC, GGALTC (or GGALT in case GGALTC looks bad).

Steve,  My Mom came to visit for two weeks.  It was very good but not
very relaxing.  I was hoping to get more work done around the house,
too, but it didn't happen.

These data are preliminary, and not all the measurements are "clean,"
especially the GPS altitude.  I'm not sure when we will produce a
"certified" data set.  It depends on our Project Manager's schedule.

Not yet.  I'll go look at it when I get a chance.  I have a lot of
catching-up to do here.

Britt,

I notice that Jorgen already did that for me.  RF01 through RF06 are
available with the same file-name structure.

Everyone:

Jorgen is out of town for the whole month.  While I am covering all
ACME activities in his absence, I will also be out of the office on
Wed & Thurs of next week (6/23-6/24).  If you need RAF participation in
these activities, you may want to reschedule.

Allen

I think we should go ahead and meet as scheduled and if any immediate 
issues needing Al or Jorgen's input arise, we'll schedule a followup asap.

Ok folks,
   I put some data for the ACME in flights on vivaldi at:

 vivaldi:/jnet/data/co2/acme

In that folder resides files for all flights, the acme01 data has been
released before and is still prelim, (I had some problems that arose
with 01 and 02 and will have them at the end of Monday hopefully).  As
for the other data, Teresa wanted me to split up the files when level
shifts occur in the signal so that is why some files have a part a and
b.  

Comments About the data:
   Teresa and I used tank numbers based of an interpolation of CMDL
standard tanks.  These numbers seem to work fairly well, however, we are
still working on more accurate numbers.  Most all of my averages are
accurate to a 100th of a ppm, however, you will see some have error of a
10th.  I am still going to have to work on this data and come up with
another release, but this is what I could provide right now. Also, I
tried to include as many necessary variables as possible from ads.  

If anyone has any questions, or if something looks wrong, please let me
know.

Lloyd

Lloyd,

Please remember that anything in /jnet/data is subject to the scrubber
which will give 3 days warning to the file owner before purging unaccessed
files after 60 days (present setting).  If you want more permanence, or
if you want to archive these data, please let me know and we can work
something out.  (You may also be interested in ATD's anonymous ftp site
as a distribution point.  There already is an ACME subdirectory for the
preliminary netCDF data.)

Dear all-

The plan from our recent meet is:

1) First flights for July beginning on 12 earliest.

We will post a met briefing on Saturday PM and make a go-no go decision 
on Sunday PM.  The decision will be indicated on a phone message and 
all potential participants will need to call in or check the web site.

2) We will see if the wind calibration flight can be done the week of 5 
July.

3) We do not anticipate any significant change to flight plans and 
procedures based on preliminary data analysis.

4) A safety briefing will be held the week of July 5-all interested 
please contact Britt or Steve asap for timing (Dennis this means you).

5) We will fly Hayman in July and a flight plan will be posted soonest.

6) We have reserved hours for a fire flight of opportunity and all 
potential participants are encouraged to stay flexible for this!

7) Preliminary results from the first sets of RF flights are 
encouraging  but considerable analysis remains to be done!  Again, 
based on those analyses we do not anticipate any major changes to 
flight plans.

Dave

Ron-

Here's my few notes from ACME planning meeting Wed 2pm.  You were going to
add/correct and pass along to Schanot/Jensen.  Appended here is Steve
Aulenbach's message from today, in case you didn't already get it.

My notes say:
 July 6-9 (short week) no flights. Try to schedule safety briefing for
those who need (new ACME scientists & perhaps Civil Air Patrol people).
Dave Schimel will review weather and update plans Saturday July 10,
possibly again Sunday July 11. If a flight is wanted Monday, he will
contact Jensen + try to arrange. I think the wind cal flight with trailing
cone could be done this week if RAF wants.

 July 12-16 two flight days this week.
 July 19-23 two flight days this week also.

Possibility of doing a weekend flight will be pursued if necessary.  PI's
will avoid this, but if there are a lot of unused hours or if weather
favors only weekends, then will talk to Jensen.

  ..Dave..

Ed,

Below are comments from Dave Rogers and David Shimel regarding
the next set of ACME flights.  The only discrepancy between what
I told you and what appears below is that no mention is made of
a possible "winds/CO2" test flight the week of July 5.

Hello all,

We had to get the met data used for the STILT runs off temporary 
storage. The files for the days flown are on the MSS under /AULENBAC. 
We also have them available on local drives. Britt and Ron, did you 
want to get copies slurped into the RAF domain?

Steve

Your call.  Do you want that met data here?  If so, I can get the files
for you.

Everyone:

ACME flights will not begin until the week of 12 July.  Current plans
call for a set of standard morning/afternoon paired flights on Monday
the 12th - 0600 takeoff on morning mission.  Everyone should expect to
revert to a normal field OPS schedule (7 days a week open for flights)
for the second half of the project.  In order to keep everyone 
abreast of project status during the weekends, we have set up an ACME 
status hotline.  The phone number is: (303) 497-1040.  The message will 
be stored as the standard greeting on that line.  The phone will not 
pick up until ring 4 - be patient.  Do not try and leave messages on
this line.  If you have to alert us to any problem you need to contact 
me directly at my normal work (303-497-1063) or home (303-421-3926)
numbers.  We will try to provide status updates by 1300 on the day 
preceeding a planned mission.

Allen

Dear ACME Crew -
The first two flights of the July campaign were conducted today.  Skies 
were clear, wiinds were light, and CO2 gradients were strong - should be 
an interesting data set to analyze.  Unfortunately there are still a few 
persistent problems with instrumentation.  We will be addressing these, 
and considering the weather, as we plan for a potential second flight 
day on Wed, Thu, or Fri of this week - planning meeting tomorrow at 1 PM 
at RAF with a go / no-go decision for Wednesday by 1:30. 
Britt

This morning, Teresa discovered a hydraulic fluid leak on the belly of 
the C130, and the presence of hydraulic fluid in the chemistry inlets.  
Obviously this is a very serious concern for our measurements.  Teresa 
will characterize the impact of this fluid on the CO2, CO, and O3 
measurements before moving the inlets to a forward/side location.  We 
will also ask the mechanics to look at the leak itself.  We will not fly 
tomorrow to allow time for this work, and will make a go/no-go decision 
for Friday at 1:30 PM tomorrow.
Britt

The hydraulic fluid was not from an active leak, but from a spill that 
occurred during a filter change in June as a result of a faulty check 
valve.  The remaining fluid in the belly of the aircraft was cleaned up 
yesterday, and the plane is flying right now for 1 hour to verify that 
no more fluid is leaking through the rivet holes.  We won't fly tomorrow 
to allow for more time to finish instrument work in response to this 
leak as well as performance concerns identified during RF08.  The runway 
is closed for maintenance on Monday.  We will plan to fly on Tuesday and 
again on Thursday or Friday of next week.  If conditions are suitable, 
we will fly a Hayman experiment on Tuesday.
Britt

Hello all,

The current plan is for a 0630 takeoff tomorrow morning for a 3-4 hour 
flight over the Niwot study area. The science crew should be at RAF by 
0530. Please remember to check in with Allen Schanot prior to the 
flight. The dawn patrol is expected to stumble in for the go/no-go 
meeting at 0430. Check the ACME hotline for the latest updates.

If conditions permit, there will be a follow-on afternoon flight for 
the Niwot area.

Steve

This morning's flight was successful, and we saw persistently high CO2 
at low altitudes associated with respiration into a very stable layer.  
We have cancelled the afternoon flight because of rapid storm 
development.  We plan to fly again on Monday morning (take off 0630).  
Please check the hotline (303-497-1040) on Sunday afternoon for last 
minute updates.

I have a few photos of the C-130 flying over me between 0700-0730 on the 
aspen tower from yesterday's flight at:
http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rtf/projects/cme04/photos/aspen/jul22/
(All but imgp1540-1542 show the plane.)  Happy viewing!

...Steve Oncley

P.S. As far as I know, all sensors on the willow and pine towers 
(including hydra) were operating properly during this flight.  (The 
aspen tower has not yet come on line.)

Dear ACME-

I'm headed out of town on Sunday so I wanted to say thanks to all for a 
fantastic airborne campaign.  You all brought this all together under a 
lot of time pressure, and we collected some amazing data in conditions 
popular wisdom suggests can't be sampled.  Thanks to all of you for a 
great effort!

Dave

Instead of two, we will fly one 4.5 hour flight on Monday, focussing on 
midday uptake and linking to the recently deployed CO2 network on Niwot 
Ridge.  We will plan for a 9 AM take-off with the possibility of 
delaying 30-60 minutes if the weather looks favorable for VFR conditions 
extending later in the day.  The weather review and flight planning 
meeting will be at 7:00 AM and all crew should be on hand by 8:00 AM.
Britt

Dear All,
We had an excellent last flight today and have concluded operations for 
this campaign.  Thanks to everyone for all the hard work.  Dave S. is 
out of town for several weeks, but I will ask him to schedule a 
preliminary data review meeting (and the end of project party) to occur 
soon after he returns.  Off to cash in my RAF frequent flyer miles.
Britt

Following is an exerpt from AIRS-II.  Hope you find it useful.

RF13
   Original ADS data File was "fixed" to correct an incorrect date using the
    program "edADShdr"
   Could not set start time to other than the beginning of the ADS data file
    (Actual flight times:  16:26:22 to 21:37:14)
   GGALT not trustworthy for this flight; suffers numerous glitches when ADS
    dropouts occur (16:18:59 to 16:20:54 on ground, 20:58:55 to 20:59:44,
    21:02:04 to 21:03:08, 21:04:02 to 21:05:16, 21:09:03 to 21:09:45 and
    21:11:20 to 21:12:15)
   DPB transient (balance) 16:41:56 to 16:47:20
   260X erratic, especially 19:02:30 to 19:06:20
   NLWCC no good before 16:49:18 (large offset)
   PCN glitch 16:52:05 to 16:52:11
   QCs agree better at high rather than low altitudes (although true airspeeds
    track very well)
   RSTB1-RSTB ~ 2.1C mean difference
   WI/WIC mean -0.84 M/s
   XGN1 seems to be failing
   XGN2 seems to have failed

Hi Ron,

Got your message. Give me a call when you get a chance at x1701. I put 
drafts on a "secret" site until we have a chance to talk.

Dear all,

After a wild summer, Fall appears to be here-anyhow I am writing this 
enveloped in a precipitating cloud....  Thanks to all once again for an 
incredible effort during ACME.  Now is the time to reap the fruits of 
that effort.  I'd like to lay out a schedule for project science 
meetings looking ahead a bit to keep up our momentum.  Here's what I 
suggest:

Late September.  Meet to assess the state of the ACME data, get a 
progress report for all on CME and evaluate the data requirements 
(especially archived meteorology) for modelinganalyses of ACME (Stephan 
to join by phone), discussion of possible 05 field projects, especially 
regional deployment of concentration instruments (Steamboat, Middle 
Park, etc)

November-early December. First review of progress, modelers report back 
for interaction with observations, preliminary data analysis

April.  Full science team meeting including inviting out-of-staters. 
Review progress, discuss preliminary papers, prepare for 05 meeting 
talks.  I am checking tosee whether we can afford to hold this meeting 
in Summit County at Breckinridge or Keystone as a reward for all the 
hard work.  Rates are low at the end of ski season and the skiing can 
be good too-

Dave

Hello all,

We're assembling template and background materials (sponsor logos, 
flight tracks, C130 graphics, etc.) for AGU. It will be stored at 
http://swiki.ucar.edu/acme/templates . We'll announce to this list when 
the first round is available. If you use RSS, you can also subscribe to 
the ACME Swiki change summary at http://swiki.ucar.edu/acme/rss

Thanks,
Steve

Dear Steve--


I am putting together a poster on remote sensing and ACME/CDAM, and
was wondering if any flight path data are available.  I downloaded the
spreadsheet showing end points, but I am looking for points along the
path.  Are any flights available?  This is for a poster, and so
preliminary data would be fine.


Thanks,

Jeff

Thanks, Steve.  At this point, I'm essentially done with the poster, 
so won't need the points (I'm including a map from the ACME web site).

Steve,

My plate is full next Tuesday (9th) until after 3:00 p.m., but I don't
think my attendance is essential.  I can read the minutes when posted.

Steve,

Oops!  I misread your message.  My MM shows Wed 10th AM, Thu 11th AM and
Tue 16th AM commitments.  You weren't obtuse; I wasn't awake!

I anticipate NO changes to the netCDF files between now and that meeting.
Jorgen is working on "other things."

Hi Ron,

Yikes was my email that obtuse? Tuesday is the only day that we can't 
meet. So, can you make it any other day? Minutes? Surely you jest, sir.

Hey, do you anticipate any updates to the ACME netCDF files on the ftp 
site prior to the meeting next week?

Cheers,
Steve

Hi Jorgen,
I think I remember you saying that the next version of the ACME RAF data 
files would be produced before RICO.  Can you tell me if this has been 
done?  Also, when they are updated, could you please put them on the ftp 
site (Stephan and Bill, the old files are at 
ftp://ftp.atd.ucar.edu/pub/archive/RAF-projects/ACME/).  Thanks,
Britt

Jorgen and Ron,

As promised, attached is a quick and dirty listing of bad or missing 
lats, lons and alts. There are roughly 4819 records in the 1Hz netCDF 
files that meet the criteria listed below. The latc-lonc constraints are 
from a visual inspection and the ggaltc constraints are the lowest point 
in Colorado and the published C-130 ceiling.

mysql> select flight, timeoffset, lonc, latc, ggaltc into outfile 
'd:/acme/probs.csv' fields terminated by ',' lines terminated by '\n' 
from all_flights where lonc < -109.17 or lonc > -104.75 or latc < 38.22 
or latc > 41.75 or ggaltc < 1000 or ggaltc > 8000;
Query OK, 4819 rows affected (7.78 sec)

Steve

To all,

The low-rate production flight-level data from the C-130Q are now available.
We are working on the high-rate data which is not yet ready for release.

The web page:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Catalog/taplog.lrt.125.html
has the ACME low-rate data catalog with links to request the data files.

The web page:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/data_catalog.html
has links to the catalog (mentioned above and an example netCDF header
which contains, among other things, the measurement list.

Hi Ron,

Just because you know someone will hit it ... the app at  
http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/mss_retrieval/ does not list ACME as a 
project option.

Cheers,
steve

Steve,

It will take a few days for that application's master catalog list
to update.  That is why I gave only the URLs I did.  There is a link
in the data catalog I perhaps should disable until then.  (I'll do
it now.)  Thanks for the heads-up.

Ron

You're welcome. Hey, the MSS transfer for all files was pretty snappy!

Cheers,

Steve,

It took only about 4 minutes to transfer these small netCDF files from
Jeffco to the Mass Store.  The high-rate files will take a bit longer.

Hi Jeff, Jielun, Sean, and Ron,

Ron, is the final version of the aircraft data close to release or 
should Jeff use the old files? If the answer is old files, can you 
provide a pointer?

Jeff, you're right - not all of the CME-related data is documented on 
the swiki. Jeff, are you on the CME mailing list? Sean Burns has sent 
these URLs to the mail list. Sean and Jielun, anything to add?

http://urquell.colorado.edu/data_ameriflux/data_5min/
http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rtf/facilities/isff/varnames.html

Apologies to all for the brevity but I have to run out the door,
Steve

Hi Ron and Jorgen,
It doesn't look like any of the jnet/data files have been updated and I 
can't find any files on the RAF web page (Jorgen had said both would be 
done last Wednesday).  Please let us know when and where we can find the 
new data.  Also, any updates on the high-rate files would be 
appreciated.  Thanks a lot,
Britt

hi Ron,

Just a quick offline "heads-up" -- did you mean to write "newly-created 
ACME web pages on RAF's web site" instead of RICO?

What should I tell Jeff Hicke? (see my earlier email).

Cheers,
Steve

great thanks Ron, I assume you meant ACME not RICO though?

To all,

For those of you who have an ATD login account, you may access the low-rate
netCDF data via the directory:
  /jnet/productiondata
Note:  there are other files in this path, since this data partition is
not limited to ACME data.

The ACME file names are of the form 125rf##.nc, where ## is the flight
number.  (Use the data catalog URL to map flight number with date.)
  http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Catalog/taplog.lrt.125.html

I can't get access raf.atd.ucar.edu via ftp or sftp - here are the 
direct paths for those with ATD accounts
/net/ftp/pub/temp/users/campos/acme/co2/29nov/
/net/ftp/pub/temp/users/campos/acme/co/
- note CO data appears to be up one directory from where it was before 
(12novData)
Teresa or Ron, can youplease provide instructions for how those without 
an ATD account get ftp to work?
Thanks,
Britt

Teresa and others,

As a second source, we can put these files on the ACME swiki. Available 
to anyone with a web browser, t is hosted by some impressive cyber 
infrastructure, the NCAR Web Cluster. If you go to 
http://swiki.ucar.edu/acme/44 you will see that pages already exist for 
each of the flights. Any of us can post any data files, ground as well 
as airborne, to the swiki. Teresa, if you send me an appropriate README, 
I can post my version of the files to the swiki tomorrow while I work on 
the sat data. Alternatively, either you or Ron could post away. If you 
look at the bottom of the page, you'll see that Mark and I have 
considered something similar for the MCR data.

Steve

All,

It has been my experience that providing multiple sites to find and 
download data is a "good thing". Ron and Teresa, with a small 
investment of time (quick text description, uploads) we could get this 
set up tomorrow morning and announce it to both the ACME and CME lists.

Sean and Jielun, we already have some of this in place for CME type 
data. Is there anything to add?

Bill, we talked about the SIPnet data this morning. Perhaps we could 
also double check the STILT uploads.

Stephan, ... hi!

Steve

Hi Ron,

No respect due - I should have said 'tomorrow morning or some other 
time that fits in with your busy schedules. My bad. I'm swamped myself. 
Give me a call when it is convenient for you.

Bye,
Steve

Hi All,

Steve, attached please find a readme file to include with the data on 
the swiki.
  Thanks very much for hosting the data and helping to make it more accessible.
Thanks also to Ron for clearing up for all of us the problem with the ftp
address I gave you.

Hopefully this readme file will make it clear to all how the data can most
effectively be used.  Please let me know if more or different information here
would be helpful.  Yes, Britt, the next release will include the rest 
of the HK
variables you've been so patiently waiting for.

Cheers,

Teresa

Release date: 29 November, 2004
Preliminary CO2 data
Please use with caution, especially when the CO2 housekeeping pressure variable (column 25) is not constant to within a few tenths of a mBar.
Preferred value for CO2 mixing ratio is in column 3, derived from a polynomial sensitivity function.
Data have been averaged from a native sampling rate of 25-Hz down to 5-Hz. 
Auxiliary data from RAF standard sensors (columns 5-18) were best available values at time of processing, and, therefore, do not represent final release data quality.  Please use these with caution.

25 data columns, listed in the order stored within each file, represent the following variables:
UT, universal time, in fractional hours, GMT
C02, mixing ratio (ppmv) {intepolated by a quadratic sensitivity function}
CO2, mixing ratio (ppmv) {interpolated by a linear sensitivity function}
CO2, raw singal, V
ATX, ambient temperature, celsius
DPXC, corrected dew point in degrees celsius
LATC, latitude, degrees
LONC, longitude, degrees
PALT, pressure altitude, meters
PITCH, aircraft pitch angle, degrees
UIC, corrected wind vector East component, m/s
VIC, corrected wind vector West component, m/s
WIC, corrected vertical wind vector, m/s 
MRLA, water vapor mixing ratio, Lyman-alpha sensor, g/kg
MRLA1, water vapor mixing ratio, Lyman-alpha sensor, g/kg 
CONCN, condensation nucleus concentration, #/cm3
HGM232, geometric radar altitude, m 
THETA, potential temperature, K 
CO2 sensitivity coefficients, squared term for polynomial interpolation
CO2 sensitivity coefficients, linear term for polynomial interpolation
CO2 sensitivity coefficients, Constant term for polynomial interpolation
CO2 sensitivity coefficients, Linear term for linear interpolation
CO2 sensitivity coefficients, Constant term for linear interpolation
CO2 Calibration valve state : lo_span=4, ref_cal=1, hi_span= 3, long term_standard= 2
CO2 housekeeping pressure variable, mBar (Cell Bypass P)

Hi Jorgen,
We are still fielding quite a few questions about what the RAF variables 
are and which ones folks should use in their analyses.  What we really 
need is a page like
http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/IDEAS-2/variables.html  and
http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/IDEAS-2/varlist.html
from the IDEAS project.  If you have anything else that recommends which 
latitude, longitude, altitude, temperature, humidity, etc. to use, that 
would be great as well.  Thanks!
Britt

To all,

The low-rate production flight-level data from the C-130Q are now available.
We are working on the high-rate data which is not yet ready for release.

The web page:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Catalog/taplog.lrt.125.html
has the ACME low-rate data catalog with links to request the data files.

The web page:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/data_catalog.html
has links to the catalog (mentioned above and an example netCDF header
which contains, among other things, the measurement list.

Mark & Stuart,

The C-130Q digital camera photos from the ACME project have been assembled
into tar files of about 600MB or less and archived to the SCD Mass Store
System (MSS) in the directory:  /RAF/2004/125/CAMERA/
(Note: ujlike the RICO

Tar directory lists of all the files can be found locally in the directory:
     /jnet/local/proj/125/Production/archive/Camera_Archive/File_Lists/
The MSS tar files have the same name as the directory lists but without
the ".dir" extent.

If these have general interest, I should move them from the /RAF path to
the /ATD/DATA path where the data retrieval web page has access to them.
Right now, the only easy way to get the files is to use the DCS command
"msrcp."  For example.
     msrcp mss:/RAF/2004/125/CAMERA/RF02/DOWN.20040514.194830_201659.jpg.tar
/jnet/data/DOWN.20040514.194830_201659.jpg.tar

(At this time the /jnet/data partition is quite full, and we are trying
to get more on-line storage space available here at Jeffco.  So it would
be a good idea, for now, to find your own space to park these files.)

Hi Jorgen,
If you could also please let me know if and when there will be an 
informative RAF ACME page such as the one for IDEAS 2 
(http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/IDEAS-2/).  Not everything on that 
page applies in this case because we have the swiki page, but things 
like variable lists, the flight summary matrix, the data quality 
reports, and the links to the relevant RAF technical reports would be 
highly useful.  Thanks a lot!
Britt

Britt,

It is being worked on.  I have an interim site in development which you
can view at the URL:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/ATD_only/Projects/ACME/docsum.html

Be aware that some of the stuff is "boiler plate" and has not been
revised specifically for the ACME project.  (Note:  there are a lot
of missing links!)  Therefore, treat this in a way similar to our
preliminary netCDF data.  As the individual pages get updated and
correctly edited, the site will be released to everyone.  As of now
this site and its pages are viewable only within ATD.

Ron

Britt,

It has no restricted login/password.  It is hardwired to allow only
machines within the ATD domain to access the site.

Britt,

Listings of available tarred files can be found in the directory:
   /jnet/shared/proj/125/Production/archive/Camera_Archive

The tar files were generated with a size less than 700MB to facilitate
their transfer to a standard CD.  Each file's name reflects the flight
number, date and time period covered.  They reside on the SCD Mass Store
System in the directory:
   /RAF/2004/125/CAMERA/
You should be able to retrieve them via the "msrcp" command on
Solaris/Unix/Linux systems.  Example:
   cd <desired destination directory>
   msrcp mss:/RAF/2004/125/CAMERA/RF02/DOWN.20040514.194830_201659.jpg.tar DOWN.20040514.194830_201659.jpg.tar

To all,

Sorry I didn't see the earlier post about inability to access Teresa's
data via ftp.

The simple answer is *don't* use raf.atd.ucar.edu.  Instead, use
 ftp ftp.atd.ucar.edu
  login as anonymous
  cd pub/temp/users/campos/acme/co2/29nov/
    (get your files)
  cd pub/temp/users/campos/acme/co/
    (get your files)

Posting them on the swiki is also a good alternative.

Ron

To all,

For those of you who have an ATD login account, you may access the low-rate
netCDF data via the directory:
  /jnet/productiondata
Note:  there are other files in this path, since this data partition is
not limited to ACME data.

The ACME file names are of the form 125rf##.nc, where ## is the flight
number.  (Use the data catalog URL to map flight number with date.)

Steve,

With all due respect, I won't have time to do this tomorrow morning.
Can I work with you in the afternoon?

Jorgen,

I recreated 125rf16a.nc and 125rf16b.nc so I can make an XYZ plot without
the plot scaling showing most of the world.  Just thought you'd like to
know.  So far, I haven't been able to get ncplot to show both time periods
at the same time.

Britt,

Speaking for Jorgen (as well as myself):

The production data are being processed right now.  If all goes well,
I'll be able to archive the files and make them ready perhaps as
early as the end of the day today.  Data catalogs will be posted to
newly-created RICO web pages on RAF's web site.  Jorgen or I will
send an email when all are ready with details on how to retrieve
the flight-level netCDF files.

Steve,

DOH!!

If Jeff needs our netCDF files, you can forward my message (with the
correction, of course).

Stephan,

Since you obviously have access to the Jeffco file server, the data are
available right now in the directory /jnet/productiondata/ with names of
the form 125rf##.nc (low-rate) and 125rf##h.nc (high-rate).

/jnet/data is scratch disk space which will probably not hold the current
versions of the production data.

If you cannot get access to /jnet/productiondata, please let me know and
we can figure out something else.

Ron

Stephan,

They will for awhile, but that partition is just a holding place for us to
save our production data until they get archived to the Mass Store.  If you
are working with these data, the best thing would be for you to obtain your
own file copies for use on your local system.  The URL in my announcement\
message has the request links:

To all,

In preparation for the release of all the ACME data and RAF's ACME
Documentation web site, I have moved the Mass Store archive of all
the digital camera files from the /RAF path to the /ATD/DATA path.

See the URL:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Catalog/taplog.camera.125.html
This URL also can be used to retrieve any of the files.

The tar directory lists of all the files remain locally in the directory:
     /jnet/local/proj/125/Production/archive/Camera_Archive/File_Lists/
The MSS tar files have the same name as the directory lists but without
the ".dir" extent.

Jorgen,

I found a few things worth mentioning regarding the production ACME
data.

1)  The variable TTWHC (Corrected Total Temperature, Deiced Wing) has yet
      to be listed in the VarDB file; therefore, it comes out without a
      description (No title) and no units (Unk).

2)  The high-rate versions of RF02 and RF05 both have greatly-abridged
      time periods when compared with their low-rate companions.  I looked
      at the requested time periods in your batch files, and both are OK.
      I have no idea why NIMBUS is deciding to quit early.  The log file
      for HRT RF02 doesn't show any problems but reports the short time
      period.  The log file for HRT RF05 also doesn't show any problems
      but reports the the (desired) longer time period.  I don't know
      why the actual time period in the file is shorter unless something
      happened during ncReorder.

I can archive all the files, but I think we should add the definition
of TTWHC to the VarDB file and rerun them again, so all our variables
are covered.  I can archive HRT RF02 and RF05 once we figure out what
is happening with their time periods.

Mark,

I was wondering whether you produced an MCR production data set for ACME.
I am now preparing the documentation web site and would like to make up
a data catalog for them.  (I guess I'll also need to archive them to the
SCD Mass Store System.)

Mark,

Great news.  I checked your raw data stash and I actually have archived
more files (25) than you have in your /jnet/mcr/ACME/rawmcr directory (16).
Does it mean that you have more work to do, or are they the only useful
data to come from ACME?  In case you want to compare, my entire archive
is within the file:
         /jnet/shared/proj/archives/msfiles/msraw.RAF.all
starting at line 12752.  (This file has the entire /RAF archive as of
22 March 2005; I do need to update it.)  I have renamed the files to
conform to RAF's archive file-naming conventions.

I will compose a data catalog with download links and contact info as
I have done for your other MCR data sets.  I would guess you want me to
also archive the log file associated with each flight.  They look to have
some useful metadata.  Do you want me to add it to each flight's catalog,
so people can download it, too?

Hi Ron -

Yes, I have a set of raw and processed MCR data from ACME that can be 
considered production data and should be migrated to mass store. 

The data is in /jnet/mcr/ACME, with the raw files in rawmcr and the 
processed files in MCRproc.  Note that the processed files are under 
their flight number (rfxx), and some flights have no data.

Thx - pls let me know when these are archived.

Mark

Hi Britt,

The ACME low and high rate data was finished - as your message arrived. 
The high rate data has been held up by the work Chris Webster had to do 
on the main data engine to ensure correct alignment of the INS/GPS 
ground speeds, and the new interpolation scheme to change data onto the 
25-Hz sample rate grid used for high-rate data processing.

This will also have a very small effect on the low-rate data files, so I 
have chosen to rerun thoose as well to have consistent data sets.
I hope that Ron will have the time to put the new data sets onto the 
mass storage tomorrow. After that it is onto the documentation, that you 
have requested.

Kind regards, Jorgen

There's been no changes to the raw data, so the archive you've already 
done on that set is fine (better to have all of it, just in case).  The 
processed data should be archived for the flights I've processed only, 
as it's the useful data for ACME.   I think the log files would be 
confusing to people - I only use those to check the processor, so don't 
archive those.

Thx!

Jorgen,

As of about an hour ago I "released" the ACME web site.  When compared with
the preliminary version, I removed any links that don't currently exist.
I also added new ones for accessing the production MCR and digital camera
files.  I created an "external" instrumentation configuration page which
has nothing but our normal stuff (e.g., temperature, dew point, radiation,
etc.).  The netCDF header contains some instruments alluding to inlets,
but none have been specified.

Please look over the home page to make sure that the "boiler-plate" cover
letter says what you want.

If Britt and others within ATD have been accessing our ACME page using its
original URL (http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/ATD_only/Projects/ACME/), it will not
now work.  They will have to bookmark the new one:
      http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/ACME/

I haven't yet made a public announcement to the ACME email list.  I thought
it would be best if you looked over the web site first.  If you want the
announcement made and don't have time to do the email either, perhaps you
could ask Britt to do it on our behalf.

Ron

Britt,
When I get them finished, they will point to the transcribed Pilot's Flight
Report.  We haven't located the Research Flight Reports, so we'll be using
ones from the pilots.

Thanks, Britt; I'll see what I can do to link these up.

That flight had a data dropout which caused zero values for lat/lon in
the data file.  To avoid the autoscale "feature" of including those zeroes
on the map, I divided the flight file in two at the gap and plotted them
as separate segments from two files.  When one does that with ncplot, the
"first" variable (from the first file) is blue, and the "second" one is
red.  So, the color really has no meaning other than the fact that they
come from two different files.

Thanks for pointing this out.  I just copied the text from the RICO
documentation page at the last minute and overlooked the direction.
It's fixed now.

Britt,
This is a more serious problem.  These variable lists come directly from
the netCDF header, so the definition is wrong in EVERY netCDF file as well
as in these listings.  I'll have to discuss with Jorgen upon his return how
to handle this error.  For now I can, at least, fix it in the variable
lists you mentioned.

When RDP switched to a new web server with updated software, the mail
script that I was using was omitted for "security" reasons.  I am in
the process of converting *every* RAF web page to use an updated "mailto"
command as well as changing RAF's home page from "raf.atd.ucar.edu" to
"www.atd.ucar.edu/raf/"  This is a non-trivial task, but I'm about 90%
there and hope to have it up within the next couple weeks.  (After the
changeover, I'm sure there will be some problems with web pages not being
found or things not rendering exactly right.  Hopefully feedback I get
about this will fix all these.)

Instrument anomalies come from the Project Manager's Data Quality Report
on which Jorgen is still working.

This page lists information about processed data files,
instruments and flight details.

The C-130 ACME data contains both low-rate (1 sps) and high-rate
(25 sps) files. The low-rate files have been reprocesses, but you
should see only very minor changes in the wind data from the
previous release. The change has been prompted by three factors:

(1) The current mean updraft wind is now closer to zero when
averaged over an entire flight. Previously the average was closer
to +0.20 m/s, and the change was done by changing the offset
between the pitch and attack angles. This change should only have
a miniscule effect on the horizontal winds.

(2) Much work has been done on upgrading the high-rate wind
capability of the C-130 system. The modifications have been caused
by changing some data-logger delays and filter functions for
interpolation of data to common data rates. Don Lenschow has
summarized these in a document available from raf.atd.ucar.edu

(3) The timing variables have been brought into line with
recommendations from UCAR to allow 'smart' programs to immediately
understand timing variables. This change should have no impact
on the analysis done by most or all users.

Thank you to Ron Ruth for an excellent job done in construction
of this web page and for the archival of data; we wish you happy
analysis!

Please forward comments to both of us, and note that we will be on
leave until 13 July.

All the best, Jorgen

Thanks Jorgen,
I'll wait and see if Steve sends it out today, and if not I'll take a 
shot at it around 5.  A few quick questions.

1) In the flight summary matrix, are the links in the left column meant 
to go to anything?  They all seem broken.

2) If you'd like to fill out the "Mission" column in this table, you 
could go to http://swiki.ucar.edu/acme/53 and click on each flight link 
to get its brief "Flight Summary" text.

3)  What is the significance of the red versus blue trace in 
http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/pics/125/RF16/XY.png ?

4) On the main page, I think you meant "downward looking" not "forward 
looking" on the camera link.

5) In both the low and high rate variable lists, XCMDL1 should be "CMDL 
flask sampler pump-on signal" (the SIO signal is XSIO1 as labeled below 
in the list)

6) The schematic of the aircraft configuration is nice.  Would it be 
possible to display where the various chemistry inlets were on this as 
well?  I believe CO2, CO, and O3 were belly mounted, and the MEDUSA, 
CMDL, and SIO flask inlets were upper right forward, but I will double 
check my photos if you don't have this info.  I also don't see the TDL 
on this schematic, but also can't remember if Teresa got any data from it. 

7) Do you also have an overhead floor plan?

8) I think the ACME email list has been subsumed by the CME email list, 
so the link may not be appropriate.  In any case, the archived email 
link is broken.  Steve, please comment.

9) The email links for Ron, you, Jeff, and Mark are all broken (also 
broken on RICO page).

10) Back on the flight summary matrix, were there no instrument 
anomalies or is this column still to be filled out?

11) Will there be a project manager's data quality report like the one 
Al put together for RICO (general discussion, flight by flight, high 
rate notes)?

12) Where would something like the oil leak problem that may or may not 
have affected the chemistry inlets on the bottom of the plane get 
documented?

13) Under the research instrumentation heading, it would be nice to also 
have things like the Aircraft Instrumentation List, Summary of 
Instrument Calibration Factors, and Inertial Reference Unit Performance 
Summary (from the RICO page).

That's all for now.  Thanks a lot!
Britt

Hi Jorgen,
I noticed that the RICO documentation summary page was up and couldn't 
help wondering what the status was on the ACME documentation.  I would 
guess that the RICO wheel squeaks more than the ACME wheel and that is 
why it is getting the grease, so please consider this our official 
10-month 'squeak'.  Thanks!
Britt

Hello all,

As requested at the Keystone Science Meeting, we are merging the ACME 
and CME mailing lists. The CME list is now the official mailing list 
for both ACME and CME. In a few minutes, you will receive an invitation 
to join the CME mailing list. If you wish to continue to receive 
project-related emails, please accept the invitation to formally 
subscribe to the CME list.

If you have any questions or problems, please contact me directly.

Thanks,
Steve
