This report has been written to outline basic instrumentation problems
affecting the data set.  It is organized into two sections.  The first
section lists recurring problems, general limitations, and systematic biases
in the standard RAF measurements.  The second section lists isolated problems
on a flight-by-flight basis.

This summary is not intended to point out every bit of questionable data,
but the information given here should help investigators make best use of
the data set.


Section I:  General Discussion
------------------------------
 
 1.  The wind data for this project were derived from measurements taken
     with the radome wind gust package.  As is the case with all wind
     gust systems, the ambient wind calculations can be adversely
     affected by either sharp changes in the aircraft's flight attitude
     or excessive drift in the on-board inertial reference system (IRS).
     Turns and, more importantly, climbing turns are particularly
     disruptive to this type of measurement technique.  Wind data
     reported for these conditions should be used with caution.

     The summary of IRS performance, indicated that the wind measurement
     system was performing within standard RAF specifications.  No in-flight
     maneuvers were conducted during this project.

     As an additional enhancement to this data set, a second set of wind
     calculations are included which incorporates both a humidity-corrected
     true airspeed and a correction using position and velocity updates
     provided by the GPS.  For the first 4 flights (RF01-RF04), the humidity-
     corrected true airspeed also was used in the standard wind calculations,
     because the GPS was inoperative.  (See item 2.)


 2.  A Trimble Global Positioning System (GPS) was used during the project
     as a more accurate long-term position reference than the IRS.  The
     reliability of this system depends upon regional coverage by the number
     of navigational satellites arrayed above the research area.  (Coverage
     over the local research area was excellent during the project.)  The
     GPS failed to work properly on the first four research flights due to
     interference from the ELDORA radar.  Slightly changing the ELDORA's
     transmit frequencies corrected the problem, and the GPS worked reliably
     from RF05 through the end of the project.  The GPS status outputs (GMODE
     and GSTAT) are useful indicators of proper GPS operation.

          GMODE value        Meaning
            3 or 19      3-satellite operation
            4 or 20      4-satellite operation

          GSTAT value        Meaning
             0 - 63      Doing position fixes
          2048 - 2111    No useable satellites
          2304 - 2367    Only 1 useable satellite
          2560 - 2623    Only 2 useable satellites
          2816 - 2869    Only 3 useable satellites
          
 
 3.  RAF flies redundant sensors to assure data quality.   Performance
     characteristics differ from sensor to sensor with certain units being
     more susceptible to various thermal and dynamic effects than others.
     Good comparisons were typically obtained between the two standard
     temperatures (ATB, ATRF), the two standard static pressure measurements
     (PSFDC, PSWC) and two of the standard dynamic pressures (QCWC, QCRC).
     The second dew pointer (DPB) and the fuselage dynamic pressure
     sensor (QCF) operated erratically during the entire project, so their
     measurements could be trusted.  To avoid confusion, their outputs have
     been omitted from the production data set.

 4.  Temperature measurements were made using the standard, unheated
     Rosemount (ATB) and NCAR reverse-flow (ATRF) temperature sensors.
     These standard temperature sensors performed reasonably well,
     encountering the usual problems with sensor wetting during infrequent
     cloud passes.  A comparison of the data sets yielded a good correlation
     in instrument signatures.  Due to its reliability and fast response, the
     Rosemount temperature (ATB) was selected as the reference value used in
     calculating the derived variables.

 
 5.  Humidity measurements were made using two collocated thermoelectric dew
     point sensors and a Lyman-alpha fast-response hygrometer.  As mentioned
     above, one of the thermoelectric dew point sensors (DPB) performed
     erratically during the project.  Numerous attempts to adjust its
     operation failed to get it working properly.
 
     The Lyman-alpha hygrometer is susceptible to in-flight drift in the
     instrument's bias voltage.  Due to this problem, RAF uses a special
     data-processing technique to remove the bias drift by referencing the
     long-term humidity values to the most stable thermoelectric dew point
     sensor.  For projects requiring routine cloud penetrations, the rapid
     changes in humidity or wetting of the sensor windows can trigger a reset
     of the coupling technique at inopportune times, resulting in occasional
     large spikes in the derived Lyman-alpha data (RHOLA, MRLA).  Short (2-3
     second) intervals around these spikes should be considered as bad data,
     but the remaining data should be valid.  Since this project was flown
     in mostly clear air, very few of these spikes were seen.  (Information
     on this technique and literature referencing high-rate humidity
     measurements are available in RAF Bulletin No. 22.)
 

 6.  A set of upward and downward facing radiometers was used to measure
     shortwave, ultraviolet and infrared irradiance.  It should be noted that
     all units are hard mounted and that none of the data have been corrected
     for changes in the aircraft's flight attitude.  Care should be used in
     identifying the aircraft's attitude to determine a relative sun angle.


 7.  The measurement of the surface temperature was made using a Heimann KT19
     (XKT19) radiometric sensor.  The measurement is typically influenced by
     the radiative "blackness" of the surface and overhead sky conditions and
     the contribution of water vapor in the sample volume, which is moisture-
     content and altitude dependent.  Correcting for these somewhat complex
     interactions is left to the judgement and skill of the investigator,
     since it must be handled on a case-by-case basis.  Overall, the
     sensor performed extremely well.  The Heimann loses some accuracy at
     temperatures below 0C.  For this project the Heimann (XKT19) pegged
     at 48.14C.
 

 8.  Three types of altimeters were used during the project.  The Collins
     altimeter (HGM) is only functional from 0 to 780 M AGL (above ground
     level).  At altitudes greater than 780 M the instrument is pegged full
     scale.  For some unknown reason, this altimeter had frequent noise spikes
     when pegged.  The Stewart Warner altimeter (HGME), which measures from
     150 M to 21,000 M AGL had only occasional noise spikes and appeared to
     work reliably throughout the project.
 
     The GPS also provides an altitude readout (GALT).  For accurate
     measurements, the GPS requires coverage by at least four satellites.
     If satellite coverage degrades such that the fourth satellite is lost,
     GALT defaults back to PALT values.  This can result in periodic jumps in
     the value of GALT.  In addition, the GALT signal has been "detuned"
     by the military and exhibits a slow oscillation of +/-100 M.  The GPS
     status data (GMODE and GSTAT) are useful for determining which signal
     GALT is following.  (See item 2.)


 9.  Even though no calibration maneuvers occurred during this project, the
     flight tracks had many opportunities for comparing horizontal wind during
     reverse-headings.  Excellent agreement was obtained for every flight.
 

10.  Data recording typically begins well in advance of the actual aircraft
     takeoff time.  Virtually all measurements made on the Electra require
     some sort of airspeed correction, or the systems are simply not active
     while the aircraft remains on the ground.  None of the data collected
     while the aircraft is on the ground should be considered valid.


11.  The reference sensors, used for all the derived calculations (except
     where noted in Section II), were:
      ATX  = ATB   - Ambient Temperature, Radome
      DPXC = DPTC  - Dew Point Temperature, T-Electric Top
      PSXC = PSFDC - Corrected Static Pressure, Fuselage Digital
      QCX  = QCR   - Raw Dynamic Pressure, Radome
      QCXC = QCRC  - Corrected Dynamic Pressure, Radome
      TASX = TASR  - Aircraft True Airspeed, Radome
