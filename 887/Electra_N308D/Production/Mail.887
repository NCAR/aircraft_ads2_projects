    You are probably correct that I made an error in copying the tape info.
Somehow the message I sent you did not get in my sent file. I found that the
start/stop times for flight tapes 1 - 6 are in the record book if you would
like them.

Dick,

As you probably have guessed, I'd like to archive all the raw ADS data tapes
from the VORTEX project as soon as I can.  Because of firmware limitations
with the SCD ExaByte drives, I need to know the exact record count on each
of these tapes.

When can we get together?

Bruce,

Thanks for the data.  It really helps ease the archiving because of the
current problems with the Mass Store.

I need record counts for TF02 and TF03 (R0948 and R0949).

Ron,

I don't have copies of the test flights so unless the originals are in hand
I can't determine the tape length without the originials.

I have processed the data from flight 15.  The date on the file looks fine 
(6/8/1995).  Was that the only problem with the data file.  Header data was
used to process the file, no special file was loaded.

Bruce,

Both of the test flight tapes are in the ML machine room.  I will try to read
them assuming that they have good EOFs at the end.  If they don't work that
way, I'll return them to Jeffco, count the records and try them again.

Thanks for the reprocess of RF15.  I assume that it is the file:
   /home/data/VORTEX15.cdf.

Hi Ron,

I'm really sorry to keep bugging you about these files!
I have looked and we are missing the following raf flight data files:
 23apr95
 25apr95
 5may95
 21may95 

I know that the naming convention doesn't include the date so I
hope this isn't too much of a hassle!

Could you possibly put them on your scratch space on stout & I
can copy them from there.

It looks like we have everything else, so hopefully this will be
the last time!

Thanks!

Susan

Susan,

I first have to generate the netCDF files for most of these flights, so
it may take a day or two.  There was no Electra flight on one date you
mentioned:  5 May 1995; could you have meant either 3 May or 6 May?

I've already transfered the file for 23Apr95.  I created that file as a test
over a week ago, so I hope it is satisfactory.  It is in my /dt/ron directory
as file 887T2.cdf.

The other files, when ready, will be:
   Flight     Flight    ADS tape   Output
    Date      number     number   file name
   25Apr95 -- TF03      (R0949)   887T3.cdf
   21May95 -- 854-TF08  (R0960)   887T8.cdf
    5May95 -- none  (3 May?, 6 May?)

Hi Ron,

Thanks a lot!  Eldora collected a small amount of data that day, but
it just occurred to me that the 5th of May could have been the day that
one of the engines failed & we had to dump fuel & turn around.  So,
I guess we won't worry about that day! 

Thanks for your help..have a good day!

Susan

  Unfortunately, it will probably be  mid-December. Bruce and I have been 
  very busy geting ready for ACE and will be away from RAF/Jeffco after
  1 November for two months.
  Ron Ruth (ruth@ucar.edu) will be your contact after we leave.

  Galt, from the GPS, has proven to be severely degraded by the DOD and its
  accuracy is +/- 200 to 300 meters. PALT is pressure altitude based on a 
  standard atmosphere. Since there may be some strong pressure gradients 
  flying around the storms, there could be relatively large horizontal 
  deviations. If the surface pressure were known the PALT could be corrected
  for the non-standard atmosphere. The pressure measurement for PALT is 
  accurate within .5 millibars.

  Yes, HGME is the accurate AGL.

Hi, everyone:

Jeff Keeler requested that I send my VORTEX report to all_rsf and all_rdp.
I will do it from this report. 


                     VORTEX ELDORA REPORT 4/19/95

	ELDORA collected another 10 Gbyte of data yesterday. The fore HPA
reported a coolant problem near the end of the flight. Craig and Tim are
looking at the problem this morning.

	The forecast called for a marginal day for tornado on 19 April 1995. 
The warm front was in central TX. There was a concern that the low level
moisture would not recover in time for the afternoon convections. However,
this is a day too good to pass. The plan was for the aircraft to take off
around 1-2pm. Ground chase teams were deployed to between Wichita Falls 
and Lubbock TX. 

	P3 had an engine problem at 1:30. Electra was put on hold hoping
P3's engine could be fixed. A tornado warning for northern TX forced 
Electra to take off around 2:30 CDT without P3. Electra flew from OKC
to Childress TX, turn south. Near 3:00 CDT, a tornado was spotted south
of Lubbock TX. Between 3:19 and 3:24, Electra flew perpendicular to a
series of wave clouds where theta_e oscillated consistently with the 
cloudy and clear region. P3 took off around 3:30 and headed toward this 
region. At 3:30, Electra approached the northwestern
side of a supercell. The vertical shear of this storm was quite large.
Electra circled around the southern side of the storm to be positioned
on the southeastern side of the storm (the optimal quadrant for hook
echo and tornado). The storm structure was very similar to the storm
two days ago with BWER (bounded weak echo region) and other neat 
reflectivity and velocity structure. ELDORA ran dual-PRT mode with 
Nyquist velocity +-79 m/s. Two hook echoes were identified on the 
nose radar display. Lower cloud base were also visually observed. However,
tornado never developed. 

At 4:15, Electra was in between two supercell storms. Several penetrations 
allowed ELDORA to sample two storms simultaneously.
As Roger Wakimoto stated "Two storms for the price of one". These two
storms closed in on Electra. Electra left the region to join P3 and
ground chase teams then work on the northern supercell. P3 and Electra flew
at two different altitudes and ran race track legs. Radio communications
improved but not ideal. Both planes left for a dry line near Abilene TX.
The dust storm behind the dry line reached almost 10000 ft. It was a
amazing scene of a line of Cb trailed by a huge area of brown dust storms.
Electra flew to the east side of the dryline and then 
work with P3 to practice the formation flight pattern with P3 leading Electra
5 miles at the same altitude. Pilots seems comfortable with this formation 
and it will be implemented on the next VORTEX mission.

At 5:30, only stratiform rain around. We tried to turn on real-time CAPPI.
It failed miserably and we were only be able to restore the aft radar
after that. 

In summary, this was a good mission. Unfortunately, no tornado was observed.
We are busy processing data (now the total is 20 Gbyte). Some of you may
have seen the first ELDORA movie loop created by Bob and myself. I apologize
for the 90 degree rotation of the image. Blame xwd for this mess. Bob and
I will reproduce this movie loop so you don't hurt your neck or don't have
to turn your monitor 90 degrees to view it.

Hi, Everyone:

Sorry about this late report for week 4/20/95-4/26/95.  I went to Miami to 
present a paper in the Tropical and Hurricane conference.  I returned to
Norman Wednesday at noon.  The weather in the VORTEX region was kind of
inactive for the past week.  Temperatures have been in the 30s and 40s most
of the time.  Most of us do not have WINTER clothing with us.  We were
wondering if we are doing STORM-FEST, not VORTEX. 

Tomorrow and Saturday look good for possible missions.  Next Tuesday looks
very promising and next Thursday looks even better (if you trust the model
results that far advance).

                        VORTEX ELDORA REPORT  4/20/95 - 4/26/95

	After Wednesday's excitement of flying through supercells, the cold
front wiped out most of the low-level moisture and left us with cold and
dry air in the VORTEX region.  There were no VORTEX operations.  Craig and
Tim worked on the fore HPA, and its problem was fixed.  The Translator
software (the front end software for processing ELDORA data) had some
problems.  Dick was working on that all day Thursday.  Due to single-
recording on the real-time system, Bob was busy creating a backup copy of
the data tape.  Bob and I also experimented with options to create movies
on site (U. of OK) in the correct orientation. 

	On Friday morning, the moist air was located near the Gulf of
Mexico with only a slight chance of reaching northern TX by the afternoon.
However, the dry line in western TX could initiate some convection in the
afternoon.  VORTEX was in standby mode until 1pm.  The mission was canceled
by 1pm.  The translator problem was resolved in the afternoon.  I started
to run the navigation-correction program but encountered Fortran compiler
problems.  Thanks to Michele Case, she promptly resolved the compiler
problems for me, remotely, on late Friday afternoon.  Bob recreated the
movie loop for Monday's flight and put it in the ATD Mosaic home page.
Please check it out.  We only included data from the fore radar to save disk
space.

	Saturday was declared a down day for the Electra.  Data crews were
working in the data center.  I successfully obtained the correction factors
for navigation and radar pointing angle for the 4/17/95 mission.  Every
parameter is normal except for the rotation angle (or roll) corrections.
I need to correct 1 degree for fore radar and -1 degree for the aft radar to
make the data look leveled.  I have never encountered this before.  It took 
me 3 days to convince myself that this is actually happening.  This is
likely to be a radar mounting error or problems in the encoder.  As you can
tell, we don't know the reason at this moment.

	A test flight was flown Sunday afternoon to test:
  1) radio communication between Electra and P3 (scientist to scientist),
  2) GPS drop-out problem on Electra (possible interference with ELDORA?).
This was a one-hour mission.  It turned out that the radio was not working
properly, and the GPS still does not work.  During the flight, I also
noticed that ELDORA did not see much clear-air return.  The side lobes
hitting the ground dominated the display within 10 km range.  Roger Wakimoto
reexamined the data collected during the first flight that afternoon and
found very good clear return.  The dry line can be clearly seen on both
reflectivity and velocity display.  I think the detectability of clear-air
return is good in warm moist air where bugs most likely were present than
in the cold, dry air situation that we encountered on Sunday.
        Susan Stringer arrived Sunday afternoon.

	Monday was a down day.

	A test flight was flown Tuesday afternoon to test communications,
but it still did not work properly.  The real-time ELDORA tape recording 
problem was identified.  Occasionally, the buffer is full and crashing the
data system.  Craig decided to dump all contents in the buffer (about 3
scans' worth of data) when that occurred to keep the data system running.
Other options will be tried on Wednesday.

	A cold front was expected to pass through OKC on Wednesday
afternoon.  However, the low-level moisture was not expected to return in
time for any serious convection.  VORTEX was on standby for a 3 pm takeoff.
The mission was canceled at 3 pm.  The cold front passed through Norman
around 4 pm.  When we drove to the hotel, a squall line had developed
southeast of Norman.  Some rotation was reported within some storms, but
no tornado was reported.  We re-examined the dry-line radar data on 4/17/95.
A quick dual-Doppler analysis was performed, and the results will be
examined.

                       VORTEX ELDORA REPORT 4/28/95 - 5/1/95


	ELDORA encountered a major problem on Friday (4/28/95). The internal
disk of the SUN IPC, as part of the real-time data system, was corrupted.
The Solaris system CD ROM and the system backup tape were sent via Federal 
Express, but the package did not show up Saturday Morning. Craig swapped the
dead IPC with the backup unit. A few system files were ftped from Boulder
to revive the system, but the efforts fell short. At 4:30 pm Friday, the
mission was called off. Craig and I called Rich Neitzel and asked him to
come to Norman as soon as possible. Rich arrived around 8:30 Friday night
and worked on the system for 2 hours. 

	P3 reported a supercell on northern TX which produced 4 mesocyclones
but no tornado. 

	ELDORA was fixed Sunday morning. Electra flew a mission Sunday 
afternoon with high expectation that supercells would be around across
northern TX. However, all we found was good boundary layer returns--a few
showers but no thunderstorms. Eldora sampled a dryline well (12 deg C 
equivalent potential temperatuer difference across the line at one 
penetration). Everyone was disappointed about the weather since we missed
a good case yesterday. But, the good news is: ELDORA is up and running.

	Today is a mandatory down day for both P3 and Electra. The condition
for supercell looks better toward the end of the week. Bob Rilling and
Tim Rucker returned to Boulder on Sunday. I would like to thank them for
doing an excellent job in the past few weeks.

Dick and Pual,

Here is a summary of VORTEX activities from 4/16 through 4/23.

The replacement of the windshield was completed on 4/15 and the ferry
flight two Oklahoma City was done on 4/16.  The first research flight was
flown on 4/17.  The object of the flight was the dry line behind the front
as well as checking out the new FM radio that would be used for scientist-
to-scientist discussions.  The radio did not check out well as there did
not seem to be any carrier modulation.  The GPS did not work for most of the
flight. 


On 4/18 airport gate passes were obtained from airport security.
The ground station was set up in the U of OK in Norman and the data from
the first research flight was processed. 

The second research flight was flown on 4/19.  This flight did work some
supercells.  ELDORA worked well but again the GPS and radio did not work
well.  On this flight the GPS receiver, antenna and cable had been replaced
but the performance of the system was no different than the previous flight.
The pilots GPS has also been intermittant.  Some communications were done
with the NOAA P-3 and the pilots were happy with the VHF communications.  The
FM communications between the scientists were not satisfactory.  The ground
communications are clear but the Electra signal is weak eventhough the radio
is putting out 8.5 watts.  The only RAF sensor not performing well is UVT.
It appears to be the bulkhead connector which is not accessable to replace.

4/20 was a standby day with no flight.  The 10 AM decision was delayed until
1 PM when the VORTEX flights were cancelled and the P-3 flew an ARM flight.
The radio and GPS problems were worked on.  Data from the second flight was
processed.

On 4/21 the VORTEX flights were cancelled do to poor weather for tornados.
Solutions to the GPS and radios were worked on but little progress made.

4/22 was a hard down day for the flight crew.  The forest service radio was
delivered to the motel.  The FM radio was taken from the Electra and
delivered to a local radio shop for a bench test.  

4/23 was not a VORTEX flight day but the P-3 did fly an ARM flight.
A test flight to check out a replacement radio from the Forest Service and
to check out a possible ELDORA/GPS interferrence problem was flown.  The
radio did not perform as expected but was a little better than the original
radio.

A total of 12.6 research flight hours were flown.  The ferry flight was 2.0
hours and the test flight was 1.5 hours.  A combination fax/answering
machine will be purchased and put at the airport office.

Bruce Morley

                        VORTEX ELDORA REPORT 5/2/95 - 5/4/95


	On Sunday's flight, Electra encountered a 10 m/s downdraft near the
end of the flight. The ELDORA data during that time period were examined
on Tuesday morning. We found that the Electra penetrated a rotor near the
leading edge of a dry microburst outflow. ELDORA has observed many 
unexpected phenomena during vortex--except tornados.

	Yesterday's (5/3/95) forecast called for a severe thunderstorm 
outbreak in northern TX with large CAPE and abundant low-level moisture.
The Electra took off at 3 pm. Unfortunately, #3 engine had problems, and
the Electra had to dump fuel and return to OKC. A supercell did develop
around 6pm in the southwest corner of OK in the northern side of the warm
front. How this storm was initiated is still a mystery. No tornado was
reported.

	Today (5/4/95) is a down day because of low CAPE in the VORTEX
region. 

Outlook: possible mission on Friday. Saturday and Sunday looking good.

                        VORTEX ELDORA REPORT 5/5/95 -- 5/7/95


   Electra's #3 engine was fixed on Thursday (5/4/95) afternoon.  During 
the test flight, both GPS receivers on board Electra worked fine without
ELDORA's presence.  Friday morning, Craig and Bill confirmed that one of 
ELDORA's frequencies was interfering with the GPS receiver.  Craig decided 
to move that frequency up 0.1 GHz.  GPS worked fine after the change.

   Forecast on Saturday (5/6/95) called for strong convection over the
TX panhandle along a dryline.  High CAPE (>3000) was expected.  It turned 
out that the atmosphere had not recovered from the overnight MCS in that 
area.  No serious convection was found in the target region.  Electra flew
many passes over the dryline.  Theta_e contrasts exceeded 10 deg between the
dry and moist sides.  Several virga were observed late afternoon.  Electra
penetrated a rotor at the leading edge of the outflow boundary and got
quite a bump at 1000ft agl.  In situ data showed that Electra hit a 10 m/s 
downdraft.  Doppler data showed Electra hit the downdraft side of a rotor.
Mission ended around 7 pm CDT.  Everything worked perfectly on Electra
during the entire flight.

   Forecast on Sunday (5/7/95) called for widespread convection with
high severe-weather possibility due to an approaching upper-level
low-pressure system and abundant low-level moisture.  In fact, a MCS, which
developed overnight near Amarillo, produced a tornado.  The target area
was along a dryline in TX panhandle.  Electra took off at 2:30 pm. A NS-
oriented squall line was reported along the OK-TX boarder.  A bow echo
and mesocyclone were observed near Willow, OK.  Some damages (probably
from downburst) were reported near Willow. No tornado was confirmed at
this time.  ELDORA data showed excellent storm structure and will be
available on Mosaic soon.  ELDORA went down between 2054 and 2108 due to
a data system crash.  Both P3 and Electra left this squall line about
2200 heading toward Ardmore, OK, for storms there had produced several
tornadoes.  We arrived at Ardmore and visually saw a tornado; then the storm
dissipated rapidly.  We were late for the prime tornado activities near
Ardmore.  5 tornadoes were reported, and one of them was captured by a TV
crew.  We probably saw the last tornado of that storm. 

   Electra and P3 flew around Ardmore and tried to find new targets but
without success.  The mission was called off at 7 pm.  However, the squall
line that ELDORA sampled earlier was now between Electra and OKC.  Electra
flew south into TX before pilots found a weak echo region suitable to
penetrate.  Spectacular data were collected in the stratiform region with
good bright band data.  Lightning was around Electra most of the time on
our way back to OKC.  Electra landed at 8:20pm. 

Outlook: Both Electra and P3 are hard down Monday (5/8/95).  Next synoptic
system is likely to affect VORTEX on Thursday.  The coming weekend looks 
promising if you trust the mid-range forecast.

On 12 May 1995 the NCAR Electra flew a 7 hour 50 minute mission on
a storm in western to central Kansas.  Storms were forecast to develop
along a dryline that was entering western Kansas.  Electra takeoff was 
scheduled for 2 pm, with the P3 following an hour later.  The chase teams
and Josh Wurman and Andy Pazmani with their moble radars roared off
across Oklahoma and Kansas.

We took off from Oklahoma City at 1910 UTC (2:10 pm), only slightly delayed 
by the failure of one of the DSP cards (something that came back to haunt
us later.)  We flew north into Kansas, then west to the dryline in
the Dodge City area.  We descended into the boundary layer well prior
to the dryline and put ELDORA into a boundary layer observation mode.
This operational mode collects a scan every 600 m along track and gives
returns in the convective boundary layer out to about 10 km.  The
strongly-sheared convective plumes were easily visible, and modulation
of the boundary layer velocities clearly measured.  Another boundary layer 
observational mode was selected in which the along-track resolution was
shortened to 450 m by reducing the dwell time at each elevation angle.
This produced a slight increase in the random sampling errors in the
velocities, but the data appeared entirely accpetable.

For the first hour near the dryline, we flew a large box centered on the 
dryline while we waited for convection to develop.  With the onset of a good-
sized CB, we switched to a storm data-colleciton mode that included dual-
PRF and an unambiguous velocity range of 80 m/s.  With the first pass by
the storm we were able to see that, while the aft radar velocity data
looked great, the fore radar data were extremely noisy and did not look
entirely meteorologically correct.  A second pass past the storm verified
the problem, and after a little discussion, we hypothesized that the 
replacement DSP card was, itself, defective.  Craig and Wen-Chau quickly
put together another radar operational mode that avoided using that
radar channel and we were back on the air with good data.

For the next 4 hours we collected data on the storm, which turned out to
be quite a spectacular supercell.  This storm went to TOGA COARE
storm heights of 16-17 km and had inflow maxima of 30-40 m/s and a
weak echo vault that frequently extended up to 8-10 km.  As time
progressed the storm grew somewhat less tall, but more spectacular,
if anything, for the weak echo vault grew to be this great shark's mouth
that was 3-5 km across and high, with hail shaft "teeth" hanging down
from the upper jaw, and a great inflow "tongue" cloud hanging out of the
mouth and south across the prairie.  

The radar data indicated a huge overturning of the upper cloud
mass with a 5-6 km diameter vertical circulation of inflow air that
circulated up into the upstream overhang and down back into the 
inflow "teeth".  At the 5-6 km diameter of the rotor, this vertical 
circulation was moving at about 30-35 m/s.  The radar signature of 
the rest of the storm was equally incredible.

We flew east and west, back and forth, past this gaping mouth for 4
hours, first at low levels where we got beat up every time we got to
the outflow boundary on the west, or a little less so every time we
hit the rear flank outflow on the east.  The banging took its toll on 
everything.  We lost the ELDORA data system twice for reasons that 
could have been operator error but could have also been related to 
a power fluctuation caused by some vibration-related event.  
The Electra data system also was knocked out twice in the course of
all this banging around, again for reasons not entirely clear but also
associated with turbulent encounters.  The major loss was the number
three engine generator which also was lost at the time of more, rather
than less turbulence.  When it went out, all sorts of things decided
to take a short rest, and after 12 minutes we were all back on line.

All this makes one think that less-continuous flying through strong turbulence
might not hurt.  Leaving the turbulence later in the flight we ascended 
to 3-4 km altitude and had no more problems.  That's also the point when
the really spectacular ride past the storm's gaping mouth occurred.

All things considered, we collected some excellent data on a great storm
that produced baseball sized hail (and larger, some said) but no tornado.
The Electra/ELDORA crew did a great job getting things going again when 
they broke, but for some cumulative reasons, there was too much breaking.

Lessons learned include:  we could choose slightly calmer flight tracks
when possible; we could check out our spares and repairs a little more 
carefully.

The generator is fixed, the DSP board is replaced and checked out, and we're
ready for the next one.

Talk to you soon again.

Summary of the VORTEX flight of 16 May 1995.

Well, I suppose it was the T-shirts that did it.  The night before, Rick
Parsons, Jacques Testud and I had gone to the Interurban Brew Pub in Norman
for dinner, and there we found a local brew called Tornado Alley, and T-shirts
advertising this well-named brew.  We, of course, immediately ordered samples
of the brew only to be told that the brew was almost ready (would be on
Friday), and we would have to settle for a different brew and T-shirts.
Figuring that the project needed a turn in its luck, we had dinner, which 
was voluminous and pretty good, and on the way out bought the Tornado
Alley t-shirts.  The plan was to wear the T-shirts until we got a tornado.

On 16 May we took off into a day with very moist, strong, southerly, boundary-
layer flow; a cold front was entering Kansas from Colorado, and there was a
(slightly) dry line ahead of the cold front.

The boundary layer returns were not at all impressive, which was interesting,
since the flight last Friday had remarkable returns out to more than 10 km
and easily had data good enough for dual Doppler analysis out that far.
Wakimoto already had a dual Doppler analysis for a previous day using
only boundary layer returns, and these first-pass results looked quite good.
On the 16 May flight the returns were weak even though there were some
bugs in the boundary layer.  We will have to figure out why the boundary
layer returns on the different days are so different.  A guess is that
the cirrus cloud cover and very heavy low-level moisture coupled somehow
to produce quite different conditions:  lower refractive index fluctuations
and certainly far fewer bugs than previous days.

The newly installed Electra weather avoidance radar data system was 
operated for the first time on this flight.  On the 14th, Mitch Randall
installed the system, and I spent some time with him making final adjustments
to the display.  Mitch's system makes use of a slightly-modified Collins
WXR700C radar.  Rockwell assisted us in bringing out the radar signal as
well as other housekeeping information, and Mitch built the data system
around his PIRAQ digital signal-processing board, mounted in a PC.  Mitch
also did all the interfacing work on the system.  In Mitch's typical 
understated fashion, the installation went easily, and he and I spent a 
pleasant while fiddling with the display parameters to get the display
to look useful and to not overload the computer.  Running the system is
a piece of cake:  you power it up, wait for a prompt, then type "go" to
start and "q" to stop.

After an hour of collecting in-situ data in a very hazy, murky boundary 
layer with no convective initiation, Roger elected to leave the ground
chase teams and head west to the cold front.  On climb-out we immediately
saw convection on the cold front:  a good storm that looked multicellular
and already well developed.

A first few passes got us set up on the storm.  The nose radar 
immediately indicated areas of circulation in the storm that were
associated with indentations in the storm that evolved into hook
echoes over the next half hour or so.  The nose radar velocity data 
appears like spokes, with velocity folds radiating ahead of the aircraft
as the data are folded by the aircraft velocity by about 6 times when 
looking ahead and not at all when looking to the side.  This seemingly
very convuluted display actually shows convective storm meso-vortex
circulations very well, for the radial wind depiction is bent around
the meso-vortex and even produces easily-visible bull's eyes for strong
vortices.  Throughout the flight we used the nose radar radar radial 
velocity display to anticipate the location new meso-vortex circulations.

ELDORA ran excellently during the flight.  Rick easily changed between
the boundary layer and storm observational modes and controlled displays
and recording without problems.  

The storm developed in intensity as we flew continued passes along the 
south side of the storm. The vault inside the developing hook echo was
remarkably large and devoid of returns except up at the tropopause
where the high-level divergent storm outflow covered all parts of the 
storm.  (We did measure velocities throughout the weak echo area.)
As we flew along, the circulation developed, and a good-sized
wall cloud developed and gradually lowered all the way to the ground,
where it began kicking up dust.  That particular meso-vortex did not 
produce a tornado, and the precipitation wrapped around.

But as it dissipated, other meso-vortices were evident along the
south side of the storm and also elsewhere in this multicellular storm.
Eventually a meso-circulation along the north-west side (?!) of the storm
produced a nice, very distinct, rope-like tornado.  This was at about 23:45.
And then during the next hour or more we saw more vortices at cloud base,
but no other tornados to the ground.

All systems operated smoothly during the many repeated passes that preceded
observation of the tornado, and the ground teams that had, by then, caught 
up with us, reported seeing the tornado during the flight leg prior to
the one when we saw it.  We have today reviewed the data back here at
the VORTEX data center and have verified that the radar scans show the
tornado on the preceding flight leg.  The automatically unfolded, dual-
PRF ELDORA velocities look excellent through these scans with very little
noise from the unfolding algorithm.  

These data appear exactly to be what was needed for VORTEX:  excellent
observations of the development of several meso-circulations, some of
which produced tornados or vortices, some of which did not.

Beginning on this flight, we operated with a new ELDORA crew consisting
of Rick Parsons and me.  This was a good test of things, because
neither of us has extensive experience as the data system operator:
Rick some and I almost none.  Rick was able to run the system quite
efficiently, and we were able to recover from the few problems we had
in a straightforward manner.  We operated for the full flight with only
a few hiccups:  the housekeeper hung up once for mysterious reasons and
then, later in the flight, really hung up, and the rotodome control was
also lost.  We're speculating there might have been a static discharge
at this later time, because Rick had to power down and restart the 
environmental box back in the tail of the aircraft to regain rotodome 
control.  With this problem we tried a simple restart for a while,
found out that would not work, then figured out what to do next, tried
that, and finally accomplished the restart all within about 15 minutes.
It seemed that this was only a bit longer than it would have taken some
more experienced operators to do the same thing, and it pleased me that
the system is now so easy to operate.  With the usual feelings of 
frustration and occasional helplessness, Rick is coming up to speed
quickly.

That's all for now.  We're off hunting again today.

Peter

P. S.  We'll wear the Tornado Alley shirts again.

Flight summary, VORTEX Flight 9
17 May 1995

This day dawned looking like a great one for severe weather with
moist and cloudy conditions that gradually broke and became more
convective and with enough heating that after the tornados of 16
May, we were all very hopeful.  The Severe Storm Forecast out of Kansas
further buoyed our enthusiasm with a large area indicated for possible
severe storms.

Back at the VORTEX Data Lab, some quick reviews of the data from
16 May indicated excellent ELDORA data for quite a lengthy period.

The P-3 and Electra flights departed a little earlier than planned
with the intention of simply climbing up above the clouds to look around
for storms in the local Oklahoma City area.

After flying north to Enid over some flat ground that we use for
calibration of the ELDORA scan geometry, our initial area for storms
was to the NNE of Oklahoma City.  We joined the P-3 in observations
of a multicellular storm that had several cells that appeared quite
similar to each other on the ELDORA scans.  Within 30 minutes these cells
began merging, and the constantly-changing nature of the storm began
to become more obvious.  After several more passes between the cells,
we had to abandon this particular flight track, for the merging was
occurring right over the flight track which then became a good place
not to be flying.

The flight track was then extended to the south across a new southern
front to the merged group of cells--this, visible on the weather avoidance
radar--and the flight tracks were re-established on the south side
of the line.  The overall storm reached peak intensity in the period
immediately following this, and for the next hour and a half we flew
northeast, then southwest on the inflow (south) side of the storm
observing the storm as it developed, then dissipated.  Each time we
reached the southwest end of the flight track, we encountered the
storm's rear flank outflow which was quite turbulent.  We would
pass into this outflow just to the west of the inflow region, and from
there on until the turn, everyone just hung on.  At the south end of the
track we would make a 180 degree left turn that exited the turbulent
outflow and put us on the northeastward flight track.  From this point
until we again encountered the outflow on the next return to the south,
we'd only be in moderate turbulence.

At its peak, we were able to see a hook in the nose radar data
and a lowered cloud base was visible (a poor excuse for a wall cloud),
and for a little while some small-scale rotational features could be seen
by the hopeful crew.  But that was it:  a lot of turbulence, a lot of
hope, a few rotational wisps, and a storm that never quite made it.

Interestingly, the storm was always multicellular, particularly so
in the early stages and later, and less so during the most intense
portion of the storm.  After the more intense period, a new line
formed to the east by 10-15 km and the show was over.

We climbed out, took a short look at another cell, and that was it for
the day.

Again ELDORA ran fine except for a few small hang-ups that required
two restarts of the housekeeping processor and one mysterious need to
reboot the recording processor, which temporarily lost its mind and
thought that there was a hardware error with the tape drive (not so,
it turned out).

We had at least one completely miserable passenger, and the lack of a
tornado didn't make the flight any more memorable for him.

One of the best aspects of the VORTEX support is the way the full system
including the ground data review system has come together.  Craig and
the ELDORA crew have done a great job implementing the dual-PRF, and
the data from these most-intense storms are beautiful.  With the ground
computer network, we are able to copy the data overnight, to review
the data the next day, and we are now doing preliminary dual-Doppler
analyses within a day or two.

Although very preliminary, these dual-Doppler analyses show very interesting
features of the storms in fine detail.  We are producing the analyses
on 40 x 40 x 16 km grids (x,y,z) with 0.4 km grid spacing.  The ELDORA
data have been collected with 0.3 km resolution at 10 km and, with the
beam-averaging effects, about 0.6 km resolution at 20 km.  There is a
1-minute time lag between fore and aft looks at the same point for
every 10 km range from the radar.

These preliminary looks at the data are being used in the field to
review the flight paths being used for data collection and to also
learn about the analysis techniques that will have to be used to evaluate
the data.  It is quite productive to have the mixture of the RSF staff
support in the same analysis room with the scientific users we are
supporting, all reviewing the data and learning about the problems
that will be encountered in analyzing the data.  Hopefully the in-depth
scientific data analysis will begin with far more knowledge than was
ever before possible.

Great times!

Peter

On 22 May both the P-3 and the NCAR Electra aircraft headed for the Texas
panhandle searching for the forecasted severe weather.  The Electra left 
Oklahoma City at about 2 pm with the NOAA P-3 following about a half
hour later.  Several hours earlier, after a very enthusiastic weather 
briefing, a pumped-up crew of tornado chase teams left Norman for
the Texas severe weather area.  The tornado chase cars are each equipped
with a strange-looking mast that stands 6 or 7 feet above the car and
includes an anemometer, pressure and temperature sensors, a computer 
that is connected to a radio to transmit the weather observations, plus
a pair of students to act as driver and observer.  Gung-ho weather watchers
all, the students are capable of driving across the state in about the
same amount of time it seems to take to fly there--don't know exactly how
they do it.

We took off and flew directly from Oklahoma City to Ardmore, Texas
where we found the storms as forecast:  a group of multicellular storms,
each appearing interesting, and lying at regularly-spaced intervals along a
roughly north-south line.  We flew west between two cells, the more promising
cell on the north and another one on the south.  Reaching the west side of 
the cells, we did a 180 and headed back east.  This time the gap between 
the cells closed up and we just squirted through to the east.  After
a couple of good bumps, we decided going around next time might be a 
better course of action, and by then the ground teams were already chattering 
on their radios about the southern cell, so we looped around to the south 
and took a look as we again headed west on the south side of the storm.

As this storm still seemed unimpressive from the radar perspective, we went
further west.  After a few loops to look areound, we spotted a well-developed
tornado, back to the north in the cell we had originally choosen--too bad 
for the main tornadogenesis goals!  What we had wanted was to catch the
storm before the tornado formed, and to then collect high-resolution
observations of the storm circulations and structure as the tornado
developed.  We had done this very well on 16 May, but we were just too
late to observe the development of the 22 May case.  Nevertheless, some
good tornado observations and a lot of excited airborne weather
watchers resulted.  The 35mm camers were clicking like machine guns for 
6 or 7 minutes while we watched the tornado lower, thicken, kick up 
a large dust cloud and finally dissipate.  The ground teams had somehow
coalessed around the tornado, and the P-3 aircraft was observing from the
east side, so this should be a good set of observations of a weak, developed
tornado. 

After a couple of additional flight tracks past the storm, the whole
armada reloacted to the south to observe the southern storm.  As the 
storms re-adjusted themselves and merged to become one large storm,
the intensity of the storm increased and the circulations stregthened.

The Electra and P-3 aircraft began flying east-west flight tracks on
the south side of the storm in their familiar race-track pattern.  The 
successive passes indicated this was a very intense supercell storm,
with inflow in the >40 m/s range and very large vertical rotors of
material aloft.  (Particularly on the inflow side of the storm, we routinely
observe these circulations to extend from the tropopause down to mid-
troposphere, and they overhang the inflow weak-echo vault by 10 km
horizontally, in the stronger storms).  As with the previous supercell,
these rotors were observed to turn at up to 30 m/s and were about 5 km 
diameter (vertically).

(The turbulence in these supercell storms was extremely intense, and it is
fair to say that it would be extremely dangerous to fly into any portion of
these storms.  Anywhere!  These are the most violent atmospheric storms on
earth, and the tornadoes are only the violent eddies that we are aware of.
Our extended velocity measuring capabilities (+/- 80-100 m/s) are critical
in making these measurements.)

What is spectacular with the ELDORA radar data is the extent to which
the intense eddies exist throughout the storm, particularly in the upper
reaches.  There, extremely strong turbulent eddies can be 
observed to be shed away from the updraft.  These eddies progress both
down-wind along and through the anvil and also upwind in the large,
standing up-stream rotor, and all scales of intense eddies are observed, 
each with distinct +/- velocity couplet structure, and each with 
distinct reflectivity streamers that apparently result from the storm 
water features being stretched as they are drawn out in the turbulent process.

The ELDORA radar samples the storm with a vertical scan every 300 meters
along the flight track and at high resolution in range and elevation.
The data from the fore- and aft-looking radar beams are displayed immediately
on the aircraft, and it is fascinating to watch the intense and convoluted
structures as we fly along.  The extreme updraft strength of these storms
results in highly-stretched vertical features in which, at the center of the
meso-vortex, there are narrow vertical reflectivity and veloctiy strutures.

On the next day, back in the data lab, we reviewed the data and were able
to find the radar vertical scans that were first on one side of the tornado,
then abruptly on the other.  The tornado was at a smaller scale than
the data we collected; nevertheless, its circulation can be seen,
and the relation of its location and circulation to the larger storm
parent circulation was clear.

Roger Wakimoto and Nolan Aitkens have made some fascinating displays of
the radar scans from the two tornados and also the gridded, horizontal
flow fields.  With this experienced crew, it takes only about one day after 
the flight to analyze the data to this point.  The combination of the user
scientist and students, plus the NCAR scientists and programmers--all working
in a relatively isolated data lab--is just what is needed to have this
intense scrutiny of the data immediately after each flight.  (If we didn't
feel so beat up at the end of 8 hours of flying, we'd probably stay awake
and do it immediately, because we're all excited to see what we got.)

Problems on this flight:  The previous test flight evaluated the software fix
for the housekeeper computer, and we revised the operating mode to move the
time-series data collection gates in to 10 km range.  However, beginning
about 2 hours before the end of the flight, we had increasingly-frequent
data-recording problems.  Then, uncertain what they were, we hypothesized 
they were software related.  Most of the data for the last two hours were
thereby lost.  Today's system checkout located a defective tape drive that
failed in flight.  Our error-detection software will be upgraded to provide
clearer messages that more clearly identify these types of problems.

Altogether, it was a good flight.  It is fortunate that we weren't losing
data on a great tornado.

We most likely will fly again tomorrow.

	Electra flew a mission on Saturday (5/27/95).  The target area was
Northeastern Kansas where marginal CAPE and shear might develop in the
afternoon for tornadic storms.  Electra took off at 2 pm, flew over Enid
for radar calibration and headed north into Kansas.  Electra flew all the
way into Nebraska to find several developming thunderstorms with storm top
at about 11km.  A few race-track patterns were flown, then we headed back
to central Kansas to join the ground team.  A few thunderstorms developed
and rained out with tops up to 10 km.  Mobile CLASS reported that CAPE was
only 500-600 J/kg.  This is consistent with the observed lower-than-desired
cloud tops. 

	Sunday and Monday were two consecutive down days.  ELDORA 
and UCLA crews went picnicing at Thunderbird Lake and had a field trip
to Dallas.  Rick and I both bought a Tornado Alley T-shirt after
Saturday's miserable flight.  We hope we can somehow have Peter's luck
where he saw two tornados in three flights.  Well, Roger forgot to wear
his Tornado Alley T-shirt on Saturday; maybe that has something to do
with the weather.

Outlook: VORTEX is down on Tuesday, but Electra is still on standby hoping
         to see weather developing in TX panhandle.  Wednesday is likely,
         but the forecast for severe weather does not look promising after
         Thursday.

	Well, wearing the tornado alley T-shirt may finally have done it.
ELDORA crew saw a funnel cloud and a possible tornado or two that were
reported by residents.  We need to look at the data to confirm that.
	The synoptic condition was not good for supercell in southern OK
or northern TX.  VORTEX was down for today, but Roger decided that Electra
should fly to central TX to sample possible supercells.  Electra took off 
at 2pm, flew SW through Fredrick for the ground return check, then flew
south toward Abilene TX.  Two supercells were encountered, and NWS already
issued tornado watch.  Strong rotation was visually seen by us.  Nose radar
showed hook echo signature one after another.  Spectacular wall cloud was
seen consistently.  Finally, a funnel cloud was observed.  The funnel cloud
was very short-lived.  It disappeared in about a minute.  Just a minute
(I hope) after that, the circuit breaker of the tape recording processor was
triggered by unknown reasons.  ELDORA was down for about 25 min after that.
The exact starting time of the tape recording processor was unknown.
Unfortunately, when this happened, there was no end of tape mark written to
the tape.  Therefore, it is a nightmare to process this tape.
	We went for a second storm around 2:50 pm.  We stayed on that storm
for a good 3 hr.  The storm had a hook echo early on.  We could see a wall
cloud and blowing dust but a tornado never formed.  Three bush fires were
obviously cased by active lightning.  The storm become stratified around
7 pm and the mission was terminated.

Problems: The tape recording failed right after a possible tornado.  This
          problem occurred in two consecutive flights.  Rick will look at
          the problem tomorrow morning. 

YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE THIS:  After struggling for about 2 hours at the
data center, I finally figured out a way to get at the data on the last file 
on tape. The recording processor quit at 21:18:11.  Therefore, the last good
sweepfile is 21:18:07.  I saw a funnel cloud at 21:18, and I wrote down the
time in my notebook.  The tape processor quit at exactly the same time as
the funnel developed.

Well, my tornado T-shirt did not do it.  We will try next time.  I will
report the actual damages next time.

   I guess the Tornado Alley T-shirt really did it this time.  Electra
flew about 4 hours near a line of supercell storms while ground team 
reported tornado after tornado from about 18:30 to 20:00.  A total of at
least 3 tornadoes were confirmed.  The most intense one was F3-F4.  A train
was tipped by strong wind.  The pavement of the road was ripped by the F3-F4
tornado.  ELDORA collected good data, run almost flawlessly.  Unfortunately,
no one on the aircraft saw any of the tornadoes because of rain and blowing
dust.  These storms were so intense and nasty looking.  Electra had to stay
away at least 20 km from the nearest echo, and we still were being bounced
very badly.  Electra flew at 1000 ft initially but slowly climbed to 3000 ft
due to strong turbulence.  A few visitors got really sick.
   Everyone in VORTEX was very excited about the synoptic condition
this morning: very high low-level moisture and CAPE; trough approaching.
Electra and P3 took off at 3 pm heading toward Armorillo TX.  Electra was
forced to detour because of a supercell near OK and TX border.  Electra and
P3 ended up in eastern New Mexico before we hit lots of convections.  We 
worked our way back to TX as these storms moved eastward.  At least
3 supercells aligned N-S, and these storms were very intense with storm
tops reaching 19 km at one time, not to mention the impressive weak echo
vaults in every single storm.  I think VORTEX participants have seen 
enough of them.  From the beginning, 30-40 knot winds were reported at
the surface which kicked up dust all over the place.  Poor visibility
prevented us from seeing anything near these storms.  First tornado was
spotted at 1840 CDT.  I believe ELDORA scanned through the center of the
tornado on at least 2 passes.  Unfortunately, Electra could not get any
closer than 20 km from the nearest echo due to intense turbulence.  At this
distance, the beamwidth might be too wide to resolve tornado structure.  We
will assess the situation tomorrow.
   On our last leg, the pilots spotted a tornado track.  Roger said 
the damage pattern had to be caused by an F3-F4 tornado.  A factory was
about half mile from the track.  It was an impressive track that lasted
at least a few miles.  On our way home, we saw a spectacular sunset followed
by a lightning show.  We arrived OK City at 10pm.

Problems: Before takeoff, Aft HPA would not go to standby mode; Rick had
          to replace the system control board. 
          After we took off, Aft HPA encountered a PRT fault caused by
          corrupted code in the timing module.  Rick tracked down the
          problem, rebooted the system, and everything went smoothly.
          ELDORA wrote its first full tape in this mission.  However,
          after ping-pong to the second tape drive, something happened,
          and we had to reboot the recording processor. 

Outlook: Tomorrow is likely to be a good day.  Then VORTEX may be down for
         few days till the end of next week.  We still have about 20 flight
         hours left.  So far, everytime Roger and Rick wear the Tornado
         Alley T-shirt, ELDORA sampled at least one tornado per flight.
         We will keep the streak going.

   I knew the Tornado Alley T-shirt magic would end sometime.  It was
yesterday.  Three T-shirts on Electra cannot overcome the inversion at 725 mb.
Electra took off at 2pm.  A pronouced N-S dry line and an E-W outflow boundary
north of the dryline near Plainview TX was sampled by ELDORA for almost 1 1/2
hours.  The clear air echo was as high as 4 km but only produced a few puffy
looking clouds.  Although the radar signatures were similar crossing both
the dryline and outflow boundary, the thermodynamic variables differed
dramatically.  
   Electra went to west TX to join P3 and ground chase team on a 
supercell-like storm.  This storm went up to 14 km with ususal vault and
convergence at low levels.  The cloud base was so low (500 ft) and deep
that Electra had to climb to 5000 ft before we saw some light.  The storm
was not rotating.  After only 4 passes, Roger decided to leave this storm
and go for a storm further south which showed an overshooting cloud top.
Electra climbed to 12000 ft and approched the southern storm in about 15 min.
The structure of this storm looked worse than the earlier one. After descended
to 1000 ft, I plotted Skew-T plot and found a strong inversion at 720 mb.
We knew by then that the mission was pretty much over.  However, Electra
stayed with that storm for the next two hours hoping something would happen.

Problems: The data buffer was flushed a few times during the flight on 
          both the 110 m/s header and 79 m/s header.  We did not encounter
          this happening on the 79 m/s header before.  Other than that,
          ELDORA worked great. 

Outlook:  Next Tuesday and Wednesday look promising.  We may fly to eastern
          Colorado for our next flight or the next two flights.

   Most of you probably already heard the incident of Electra hitting
a strong downdraft. Here is some more details about this exciting but
sad final ELDORA mission for VORTEX.
   ELDORA sampled a mile-wide tornado, but that's the end of VORTEX.
Electra hit a strong rear-flank downdraft (at least 20 m/s).  Everybody
and everything was flying and hitting the roof except the pilots (thank God).
Two people got hurt seriously.  Both of them had cuts on the head and might
require many stitches.  Other crew members had minor cuts and bruises.  ELDORA 
waveguides were bent, and the damage to the system is unknown.  Data system
ran well even after the hit, but 2 HPAs had faults.  Rick will access 
the damage tomorrow.  
   Very high CAPE was forecasted in OK and TX panhandle region.  Electra
took off at 2pm and headed west.  Electra arrived OK panhandle at 2:50 pm
where a supercell was identified.  Strong mid-level rotation was reported
by NEXRAD, but it did not produce a tornado.  We stayed with this storm for
about two hours before we flew to Mclean TX, because several tornadoes had
been reported there.  At 4:30 pm, Electra approached a supercell south of
Shamrock TX.  Visibility was very poor.  5 legs later, ELDORA detected a
mesocyclone signature.  The nose radar showed a spectacular hook signature,
the best one we have seen so far.  ELDORA observed tornado signature at
6:44 pm.  We visually saw the tornado (It was big!) around 7:02 pm. Everybody
was on the right side of the Electra taking pictures.  The visibility was
poor, but one could see the monster tornado about 8 km away from us.  It
was one of the smoother flights we had during VORTEX.  At 7:16 pm, Electra
encountered the rear-flank downdraft.  VORTEX was over.  A REU (Research
Experience Undergraduate) student was seriously hurt by hitting the ELDORA
waveguide.  The scene was like the aftermath of an earthquake.  Everything was
flying.  We were flying at 1000 ft when this happened.  Thanks to the pilots,
we are still alive.  After Jerry examined Scott (the REU student), he decided
that the injury was not life threatening, so we flew back to OKC and landed
about 8 pm.  An emergency team examined Scott and transferred him to the
hospital.
   Unfortunately, VORTEX ended on a sad note.  ELDORA staff will disconnect
the computer network first thing tomorrow.  Most of the computers will 
get a ride on Electra which is scheduled to depart tomorrow afternoon.
Sherrie and I will drive the van back.  Ta will ride on Electra.  So, see
you next week. 

End of the Last VORTEX report.

Ron,

Hello.  I am looking at electra flight level data collected
during vortex95.  I am interested in plotting temperature, 
dewpoint, mixing ratio, and pressure along certain flight
legs.  However, there are more than one variable for each 
of the fields listed above.  Which variables most accurately
describe the atmosphere for the four fields listed above?

Thanks.

Nolan,

   As you may be aware, the available VORTEX data are in a preliminary form,
so I caution you regarding use of any of it, especially for critical research.
Also, RAF cannot certify these data for use in any publication.  A production
data set is forthcoming, and it will reflect the greatest accuracy we can
provide.
   Having informed you of that, the choices of variables depends to some
extent on your intended use.

   The best overall static air (ambient) temperature measurement is made
by our non-deiced Rosemount temperature sensor--ATB.  This sensor is known
to get wet when subjected to liquid water; therefore, one occasionally can
see transient temperature dips when exiting clouds and precipitation.  The
reverse-flow sensor (ATRF) fares somewhat better in these conditions, but
its response is much slower, and it as not as accurate.  Some opine that our
experimental Ophir radiometer provides a better in-cloud measurement (note
the word experimental); we have not yet certified this instrument's accuracy.
   The reference measurement used in derived calculations is ATX (normally
assigned to ATB).

   We had a Heimann Infrared radiometer on board.  It measured the radiometric
surface temperature below the aircraft (cloud or ground, if clear air).

   Dew point measurements come in two flavors:  cooled-mirror and optical.
Our cooled-mirror sensors (DPT and DPB) have slow response, but are, of
course, a true measure of dew or frost point.  Depending on their adjustment,
these sensors can develop an oscillation and only approximately track the
dew/frost point.  I am in the process of perusing the VORTEX data, so I can
recommend DPT as the sensor to use for the first 5 research flights (before
7 May 1995).  Performance of these sensors can vary from flight to flight,
so I cannot yet make a recommendation beyond Research Flight 5.
   At temperatures below 0C, the mirror condensate is assumed to be frozen,
and the sensor is measuring the frost point.  To provide a true dew point,
a difference equation (between the two Goff-Gratch vapor pressure equations)
is applied to the measurement to obtain a dew point with respect to a plane
water surface (DPTC and DPBC).
   The reference measurement used in derived calculations is DPXC (normally
assigned to DPTC).

   Mixing ratio is a derived calculation.  The variable MR comes from DPXC.
The other measurement (MRLA) comes from our optical (Lyman-alpha) humidity
sensor.  The Lyman-alpha's output is slaved to MR by a data-processing
algorithm to remove drift and provide long-term accuracy.  The Lyman-alpha
best measures high-frequency (>1 Hz) humidity fluctuations (MRLA).  (We do
not calculate a dew point from the Lyman-alpha measurement.)

   The most accurate barometric pressure measurement is PSFDC, the output
from a digital barometer.  The raw value (PSFD) is corrected for static
defect (due to non-linear flow along the aircraft's skin) by an empirical
equation that is a function of airspeed.
   The reference measurement used in derived calculations is PSXC (normally
assigned to PSFDC).

Ron,

As you or whoever process the electra data, could you 
give the flights on 17 April, 6 May, and 16 May a higher
priority?  These are the days that Roger and his students, 
along with myself are currently looking at it detail.
Thanks.

Nolan Atkins

Nolan,

I will pass that request on to Dick Friesen and Bruce Morley, who are the
managers for this project.  Right now I am doing some of their "dirty work"
which I hope will save them time after they return from the ACE-1 project
in Tasmania.  I suspect that production (final) processing of the VORTEX
data will not commence until early 1996.

What I can give you now are some per-flight comments about the basic
instruments' performance for the first two flights you wanted.  I will make
a point to peruse the 16 May flight (RF08) next and update you when I have
that information.

I am looking at the "quick-look" NIMBUS netCDF data set as well as a second
set which uses the post-project calibrations.  The data for many of the
measurements better agree using the post-cals.  See my comments below.

ADIF is better using the pre-cal coefficients.  (WI mean closer to zero.)
ATB and ATRF have occasional RFI/EMI.
ATB and ATRF differ by about 0.7C (ATB warmer) (pre-calibration).
ATB and ATRF better agree using the post-cal coefficients (0.1C).
DPTC and DPBC differ by about 0.6C (DPTC warmer) (pre-calibration).
DPBC and DPTC better agree using the pre-cal coefficients.
 21:49-22:02 DPBC seems to bottom out; DPTC overshoots a little but
 better tracks the dry air.
GPS was not working.
HGM has occasional noise when pegged at full scale.
HGME has problems--Looks like the synchro got reversed again.
IRTC  and IRBC better agree using the  pre-cal coefficients.
Lyman-alpha coefficiets should be redone.  MRLA finally begins to agree
 with MR at about 20:20.

Chris,

I mentioned to you last week a problem with the HGME data from VORTEX.  It
looks to me as though the synchro output was hooked up incorrectly to ADS,
and the coarse altitude went through some kind of 0-360 degree transition at
a low altitude.  The output (displayed by ncplot) shows large jumps to values
near 30469 M shortly after takeoff.  The altitude looks credible without the
jumps.

I'm do not know what is causing HGME to be messed up on this project.  Dick
didn't notice whether HGME looked funny when doing the quick-look evaluations
in Oklahoma.  (I haven't asked Bruce.)

Something like this happened with an old project I processed with GENPRO,
and I fixed it by using ANGCOR (similar to your modvars file) on the coarse
synchro data to keep the values continuous instead of jumping from zero to
full scale.  Something like this may fix the VORTEX problem, but we should
do some investigation of the raw data.  If the problem has a chance to recur,
When the fix is made, I'd like to have the HGME code read a value from the
Defaults file (to flag whether or not this "fix" needs to be made to the
data).

I'm hesitant to do production processing of this data set until HGME looks
reasonable.  Do you have any time this week to work on this with me?

Dick and Bruce,

I have reviewed the 1-sps preliminary NIMBUS netcdf output data from all 15
5-887 VORTEX flights (data files are /home/data/rlr*.cdf).  My per-flight
comments are in the file:  /home/local/proj/887/Production/rlr.notes.  Based
upon this review, here are my recommendations:

Reference sensors to use for all flights:  TTB, DPT, PSFD and QCR.
 (See Note #1 below regarding RF13.)

Calibrations to use for all flights:
  ADIF:   pre-cal
  BDIF:   post-cal
  DPB:    pre-cal
  DPT:    post-cal
  IRT:    pre-cal
  IRB:    pre-cal
  PSW:    post-cal
  QCR:    pre-cal
  QCF:    post-cal
  QCW:    post-cal
  SWB:    post-cal
  SWT:    pre-cal
  TTB:    post-cal
  TTRF:   post-cal
  UVB:    post-cal
  UVT:    post-cal
  XKT19:  ?  (See Note #2 below.)
 The pre-cals come from the flight tape's ADS header.  The post-cals come
  from the instrument calibrations performed after the project.  Calibrations
  were chosen based on how well mean values of like measurements agreed.

The following SDI variables appeared to have no useful data, and I recommend
 they be omitted from output:  DOUT1, DOUT2, PLWC, TA2D, TADS, TEMP1, TEMP2,
 TLSI, TMP1, TS2D,
  EVTCKP  \
  EVTCTL   \
  EVTFWD    }  I need verification for these.
  EVTOBL   /
  EVTOBR  /

I propose that the following derived variables be omitted from output:
 the flux calculations:  FLXQQ, FLXTT, FLXUU, FLXVV, FLXWQ, FLXWT, FLXWU,
  FLXWV and FLXWW;
 Others:
  DVALU, PALTF, PSURF, PLWCC and THETAV.

How do you feel about putting ADS housekeeping variables in the output
 data set?  They are:  FLOADS, FZV, FZVR, TV10, V10, V10R, V28, VDREF,
 VM15A, VP15A, VP15D, XFZV and XV10.  (I vote to put them in.)
  
Note #1:  On RF13, the usual problem with QCF existed, but on this one flight,
           QCR, which worked just fine for the first 6 hours, developed a
           problem after 26:05.  For production processing, one could just 
           substitute QCW, the only other reliable Q sensor, for QCR.  But
           rather than compromise the first 6 hours of wind data, I recommend
           that we use QCR as the reference and end the processing at 26:05.
           If data are desired after that time, I propose we process a second
           data set starting at 26:00 which would use QCW as the reference.
           (The flight data end at 26:51:14.)

Note #2:  The pre- and post-calibration equations for XKT19 are significantly
           different.  Without some kind of temperature reference, I have
           no idea which calibration best represents the sensor's true
           measurement.  The post-cal seems most logical to use, but I'd
           like more guidance.  (Do we have pre-flight checks for it?)

Note #3:  For the second tape of RF09, the flight number is zero (0) in the
           header.

Note #4:  It turns out that, when the GPS is not working, the GPS-corrected
           wind variables revert to the IRS data.  Therefore, I don't see a
           need to do anything special with the variable list for the first
           few flights.

Note #5:  DPT appears to have worked quite well during the entire project,
           whereas, DPB had frequent problems with oscillation and drift.
           In my opinion we could omit DPB from output with little, if any,
           loss in significant data to the P.I.

Note #6:  HGM was plagued with some strange hash when pegged at full scale.
           It seemed to work OK at lower altitudes.  I noticed a few "spikes"
           at lower altitudes on some flights, but I suppose they could be
           real.

Note #7:  HGME had a problem during the project.  It looks to me as though
           the synchro output was hooked up incorrectly to ADS, and the coarse
           altitude went through some kind of 0-360 degree transition at a
           low altitude.  The output (as displayed by ncplot) shows large
           jumps to values near 30,469 M shortly after takeoff and often
           throughout each flight.  The altitude looks credible if one
           visibly removes the jumps, so it looks fixable, if Chris can work
           on NIMBUS.  (Refer to the email I sent to Chris this morning.)

Note #8:  PLWC/PLWCC was not working for the whole project.

Note #9:  Horizontal winds during (near) reverse-headings on all flights were
          virtually the same no matter which set of calibrations (pre or post)
          was used.

What was the problem with QCF?  I thought it could be icing or water
 ingestion, but it could easily have been something else.  Has the cause
 of the drift been found?

Where do we go from here?  Do either of you want to take over, or do you want
me to begin work on NIMBUS production setup?  Is there any requirement to do
HRT processing?

Dick and Bruce,

Since the GPS was not working properly on 1995-887 VORTEX flights RF01-RF03,
users should not necessarily trust the GPS-corrected wind data.  Calculations
for them normally use the humidity-corrected true airspeed (TASHC).  To give
the users the best wind data possible for those flights, I decided to change
the true airspeed dependency for the uncorrected winds (WI) to TASHC.  For
the other fights (RF04-RF15), the setup is normal (WI uses TASX, and XWIC
uses TASHC).

If you disagree with this decision, please let me know, and I'll reprocess
those flights the "normal" way.

Chris & Dick,

I just processed two flights (RF01 and RF10) from VORTEX to look at CHGME.
When I looked at the resulting data, all appeared to be working just fine with
none of the transients I saw in my final processing.  I then tried to figure
out why the Production processing had the problem.  It turns out that if one
turns CHGME's output off (using ^O), then the problem occurs; if you allow
CHGME to appear in the netCDF file, all is OK.

Now that things look OK, I should reprocess all the data and add CHGME
to the output file.  But CHGME is really useless to a user, since it
measures only the synchro angle.  I don't really want that output in
the processed data set.

I thought that turning an output variable on and off only affected whether
its output appeared in the netCDF file, not in the processing that occurs
within NIMBUS.  Have I found a bug, or does NIMBUS work this way with other
variables, too?

Dick & Bruce,

I have finished the production processing and data review of all the research
flights for 5-887 VORTEX.  I have composed a QC report which you are welcome
to peruse.  (It is the file:  /home/local/proj/887/Production/README and is
an ordinary text file, not in WP format.)

I have archived the production netCDF data files to the SCD Mass Store System
(MSS), and I am now preparing to archive the NIMBUS processor and all the
NIMBUS support files for this project.

If you approve of the QC report and agree that the data are ready to ship,
the next step is to prepare the Project Summary binder(s), collect pertinent
papers in the Project Folder and ship things out the door.  (Have I forgotten
anything?)

When can we get together to plan the last steps?

This is a result of the way HGME (and PSFD) are processed.  In theory the
easy way around this is to add the following two lines to the DependTable:

HGME	CHGME
PSFD	PSFD1 PSFD2

Then you should be able to turn off the unwanted variables with impunity.

Bruce,

What data format does Nolan require:  ExaByte or round tape (density?)
or MSS access?

Do we need to advise any other PIs or users about these data being ready?

Ron,

Here is how Nolan would like access to the data.  I will let you know more when
I here from Roger Wakamoto.

Bruce,

if you can tell me where the data is on the mass store and how
to retrieve it, that may be the most efficient method for 
me to retrieve the data.  Otherwise a low-density exabyte
tape will work.  I forwarded your message to Roger, so
he will most likely contact you with regard to data access.
Thanks.

Nolan

It should have been taplog.887.

Nolan,

Here is information you requested about the QC'd Electra data for the VORTEX
project.  The data are in netCDF at a rate of 1 sample per second.  Acquire
the Mass Store bitfiles transparently.  If you need help with netCDF or MSS
bitfile acquisition, please let me know.

As the log below shows, the data bitfiles are in the Mass Store directory:
`/RAF/1995/887/LRT' with names of the form `fltno.cdf.'  The list of "fltno"s
runs down the left side of the list.  An example bitfile name would be:
/RAF/1995/887/LRT/RF01.cdf

Other bitfiles you may find interesting are:
/RAF/1995/887/LRT/README          <-- original QC report (soon to be updated)
/RAF/1995/887/LRT/varlist.887     <-- variable list:  name, units and
                                       description for every variable
                                       in the netCDF files

Unfortunately, I have no experience obtaining data from the mass store.
So any information you could give me on how to grab the data from the

Nolan,

First, since you are at NCAR, it makes things a lot easier.  You need
a MIGS account to access the files.  If you don't have one, see your
system administrator.  (Dan Hansen is MMM's Mass Store Advisory Committee
representative.  I'm sure he can be of help.)

The command to retrieve one of our netCDF bitfiles from the SCD Mass
Store System (MSS) is:

      nrnet msget <localfile> l df=tr r flnm=<MSS bitfile name>

Example for VORTEX Research Flight 4:
      nrnet msget rf04.cdf l df=tr r flnm=/RAF/1995/887/LRT/RF04.cdf

This will retrieve our bitfile from the MSS and put it in your file
`rf04.cdf.'

Your system administrator may have restrictions on where you can put these
retrieved files, so work with him/her to get things straightened out.

The bitfiles (Files on the MSS are referred to as "bitfiles.") are netCDF,
so you should have utilities in MMM to work with them.  I am reasonably
sure that Al Cooper's Xanadu package can handle them, and there are a
bunch of other software packages, too.

Ron,

Here is a message from one of Rogers graduate students.  I have the video tapes
and will send them to him.  Would you please take care of the Exabyte tapes?

Thanks,

Bruce

Hi Bruce,

Roger forward me your e-mail regarding the flight level data and video tapes.
Would it be possible for you to send us the Exabyte and the video tapes?
We will play the video very careful. Thank you for your help.

Ching

I do not know what density Exabyte tape Ching would like.  Do you want me to
ask or will you do that?

For your info Ching is a guy.

into one large tar file.

Our tape drive can read either high- or low density. Individual tar for
ecah file seems the best option.
Thank you for your help.

    I guess I assumed that the video tapes were shipped with the exabyte
data to Wakimoto. Usuually we are not in the business of copying video but
send requestors to the PI who received the tapes and let them work it out.
So, I seems to me that we should ship the tapes to Wakimoto and tell Ching
to get the tapes from him and make copies if necessary. They work together 
at UCLA.

Ching,

I am making arrangements to ship you the ExaByte tape with the VORTEX
flight-level data from the Electra.

I have two questions:
  Do you want high- or low-density ExaByte tape(s)?
  Do you want the individual data files put into one large "tar" file?
    I recommend it, because the tar file is self-documenting.  However,
    if you have no way to recover individual files from a tar file, then
    we can make you a binary tape with all the netCDF files concatenated
    on it and include a paper listing of the files and their order.

I will begin the tape copies when I get this information.

Thanks.

Ching,

I apologize for not writing sooner.  It's been a busy month.

In your previous reply you requested an individual tar file for each data
file.  Do you have a problem extracting individual files from within a tar
file in which all the data files are combined?  (The choices I originally
gave you were a tar file or individual binary files concatenated on the tape.)

While we can arrange to put our data on tape as individual tar files, it is
much more efficient to package all the data files into a single tar file, and
that is the easiest form for us to ship your data.

As of now, I have arranged to make one tar file for all the data.  If that is
not satisfactory, please let me know.

I hope to have your data shipped to you within a few days.

Ron,

Our tape was labeled incorrectly..it should be May 3rd.  I do not
know how to get the file off of the Mass Store..could you give
me some hints??  Thanks!

Ron, 

I was recently reading the Data Quality Report prepared by you for
the VORTEX data.  I am looking at one of the VORTEX cases myself,
specifically the data collected on 6 May (RF05).  I would like to 
know how accurate are the horizontal winds?  I noticed in your notes
that you used data collected from a box maneuver from 23:30-24:00
to compare horizontal winds.  Could you elaborate on what you did 
for the comparison?  Thanks.

Nolan

Nolan,

Sorry for the delay in responding to your email, but I've been on vacation
and have been trying to catch up since.

Regarding the wind analysis:  I did nothing elaborate, because I was looking
for gross errors caused by a sensor malfunction.  My basic method for
evaluating the wind data is to compare the winds between upwind and downwind
legs of a reverse-heading maneuver at constant altitude.  Since no calibration
maneuvers were done throughout VORTEX, I looked for flight time periods
with potentially-uniform wind fields when the aircraft flew an "approximate"
maneuver.  For this flight it happened to be a box.

The box maneuver between 23:10 and 24:00 occurred at roughly the same
altitude, so I assumed that the wind field also would be somewhat uniform.
(That may not be a good assumption for this project, especially if the box
was flown around an inflow or outflow field!)

I looked at the east (UI) and north (VI) components of wind using the legs
corresponding closest to the upwind and downwind components.  I also compared
the values of the longitudinal (UX) and lateral (VY) components during those
reverse legs.  I wanted the mean values (visually averaged from a plot) of UI
to be the same in each direction (likewise for VI).  The values of UX and VY
should have been of same magnitude but opposite sign for these legs.

This was by no means a perfect test, but I was satisfied that no gross errors
were present.  I cannot absolutely verify an accuracy figure (e.g., +/- 1 M/s).

I'm willing to discuss this further with you, if you want.  Normally, I spend
Tuesdays at FL-1, so that should make things easier.
