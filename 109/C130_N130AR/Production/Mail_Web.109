Jorgen,

The AIRS-II web site prototype is available at the URL:
      http://www3.atd.ucar.edu/AIRS2/

Instead of cloning it for later, I'll make a gziped tar file of the entire
directory and keep it.  Then it still will be easy to restore if needed.
I should save a copy of the MySQL data base, too.

To all,

I am in the process of developing a "real-time" web site for AIRS-II
patterned after the IDEAS-3 web site.
      http://www3.atd.ucar.edu/AIRS2/
At present, this site is available only within ATD and not to the outside
world.  I expect to request activation next week.  As of now there are
still many links that need updates.  Again, as for IDEAS-3, this is a work
in progress.

Registered web site users within ATD should be able to use the live
chat link for today's flight.  (You also can use your own IRC client
by connecting to "syrah.atd.ucar.edu" using port 6667 and the "#AIRS2"
chatroom.)

If you need a login, you can use the "create one" link below the login
text boxes on the upper left corner of the web site or the registration
link on the lower right side.  On the other hand, you can also let me
know, and I'll set one up for you.

Ron,

one of those trivial to fix but otherwise pesky issues. A trailing slash was required in the URL, that's
all. I noticed that was the issue as well with IDEAS3, but you added it in the link.

I felt that could confuse users so I figured out how to make either URL work. Now it should work
correctly with/without trailing slash. Check it out.

Santiago,

Thanks for all your work.  I'll provide links on our web site and test it
at home, too.

Your request #5942 was updated by newbery:

Ron,

this is done, I committed the changes into CVS, restarted httpd
on linus, tested looks good.

Only thing left to try is to test it via my ISP.

To all,

The AIRS-II web site is now up and available to all:
      http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/AIRS2/
You may encounter a permission problem when accessing some of the pages,
and we are working to correct it.  If you have trouble, please let me
know, including details (what page you were trying to access, etc.).

For those of you who participated in the IDEAS-3 project, your login and
password remain the same.  For new participants, I will send individual
login/password messages so you can gain access to more of the web site,
including calendar, forum and news article postings.

I welcome your suggestions about this site.  There is a special forum
topic for it.

Ron

Hi Ron,

When visiting this URL:

http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/AIRS2/

I get a page with only this message on it:

Warning: Failed opening 'modules/Gary_Granger/index.php' for inclusion 
(include_path='.:/php/includes:/usr/share/php') in 
/var/www/html/AIRS2/index.php on line 127

Any ideas what's wrong?

Hi Sonia,

Yes, I am happy about the web site also. There is access to the first 
data files from there - please inform us if it doesn't work as planned. 
We have some problems testing access from outside the firewall, as we 
are mostly inside the firewall.

The 260x is indeed on the plane, located on the center of the right pod.

Let me know how it goes - Jorgen

Hi again Ron,

I'm working from home today.  In checking out the airs2 web site, I can view 
the current month of the calendar, but the links on the calendar itself 
point to www3, which I can't access since it's behind the firewall.  For 
example, the link to the next month, the links to individual calendar 
entries, and the links to view a particular week all point to www3.  Is this 
intended?

Thanks,
gary

Same behavior with the IDEAS3 site.  The calendar links point through www3.

Most of the web site is working to the outside world, but I found that
the cgi-script (C130_status.pl) located on syrah doesn't work outside
of ATD.  May I move it somewhere else, so Jorgen can access it from
Cleveland?

To all,

The AIRS-II web site is now up and available to all:
      http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/AIRS2/
You may encounter a permission problem when accessing some of the pages,
and we are working to correct it.  If you have trouble, please let me
know, including details (what page you were trying to access, etc.).

For those of you who participated in the IDEAS-3 project, your login and
password remain the same.  For new participants, I will send individual
login/password messages so you can gain access to more of the web site,
including calendar, forum and news article postings.

I welcome your suggestions about this site.  There is a special forum
topic for it.

Ron

Gary,

Yes! It has happened to me, too.

For anyone who has used Susan's ATD MSS Data Retrieval web site, that page
creates/uses a number of browser cookies.  One in particular breaks the
PostNuke web site used for AIRS-II (and the old IDEAS-3).  If you are
running Mozilla (perhaps other browsers have this feature, too) you need
to remove the "name" cookie owned by "atd.ucar.edu"

Mozilla task bar:  Tools --> Cookie Manager --> Manage Stored Cookies
Find "atd.ucar.edu" under the "Site" column and "name" under the
"Cookie Name" column.  Click to highlight it, then click on the
"Remove Cookie" button at the bottom of the window.  Close the window
and try the web site again.

At our last RDP staff meeting, Susan said she would change the cookie name
to something more specific (rather than just "name").  I guess she hasn't
had time to update it yet.

Hi Sonia,

Yes, I am happy about the web site also. There is access to the first
data files from there - please inform us if it doesn't work as planned.
We have some problems testing access from outside the firewall, as we
are mostly inside the firewall.

The 260x is indeed on the plane, located on the center of the right pod.

Let me know how it goes - Jorgen

Bill,

Were you accessing the AIRS2 web site?
      http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/AIRS2

I just tried your login/password with Mozilla, and it let me right in.

If you have some browser-specific password length issue (like 8 characters
or less), I can reset it to something shorter.

George,

Sorry -- my mistake.  Your login should not be your email address,
just "nicoll".

Gary,

No, it isn't intended.  How about doing me a favor:  See if you get the
same response with the IDEAS3 web site:
      http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/IDEAS3/
If so, then it's a problem with a proxied PostNuke web site.  It will
take a PHP or PostNuke expert to help me fix that.

Thanks.

Gary,

Thanks for the help.  I guess it's now time to find an expert who may be
able to fix this.

Jorgen,

Here's the URL for Dave Roger's generic aircraft configuration diagram
with an added table:
      http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/IDEAS/ac_config_2.html
This version also uses a mouse-over feature to add text messages in the
brownser's status bar at the bottom when the mouse is set at particular
points on the diagram.

I can easily adapt this for AIRS2.

Steve,

I've got the form up and running for the AIRS-II project.  See the URL
      http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/AIRS2/

Thanks a bunch for letting me use it.  It seems to fill the bill, and
you saved me much development time.

At present the script is running on an internal server.  I was wondering
if you have written this script with security in mind.  I'd like to put
it on an ATD exposed host, so our project scientists can access it from
the field during the AIRS-II project.  However, I'd like it not to be
exploitable by a hacker.  (It's URL will only be available to registered
users of our web site, but the script will be in our cgi-bin directory
in case a hacker can find it there.)

I obviously made some changes (in addition to the project-specific HTML)
specifying new directory paths for:
   line 26: $DOCROOT =
   line 27: $REAL_DOCDIR =
   line 28: $DOCDIR =

   line 30: $FOOTER =  (minor html code change)

   line 35: $FILE_TEMPLATE =
I created a second-copy file template (without the time stamp label):
            $FILE_TEMPLATE2 =

I activated (uncommented) the save-state and specified its directory path:
   line 39: $STATE_FILE =

I also changed these file paths
   line 81:  $oldfile =
   line 148: $file_dir =

I added code to make the second copy:
   after line 224:
      $title2 = $FILE_TEMPLATE2;
      $file2 = "$file_dir/$title2";
      system("/bin/cp $file $file2");

I'm not sure how to verify that the script is "secure."  I don't really
see any obvious holes, but I'm no perl expert.  I know that the -T option
at the top of the file is helpful.  From other scripts I have used Jen
Oxelson (our former web administrator) was worried about certain "special"
characters in input strings as well as buffer overflows.

Do you know whether JOSS ran this script on an exposed host and whether
or not there was any problem?

Thanks!

P.S.  I've attached my latest version in case you're interested.

Ron-

I would like to suggest changing a few weather links on AIRS-2 web page.
There are probably others that would be useful, for example from MSC?

Dave,

I am using the "Web Links" link in the "Help and Resources" section which
I ignored in IDEAS-3.  However, I like the one-click Wx links on the left
side, so I'll be making the changes you suggest.  I wasn't aware that the
CSU CIRA loops were programmed for anything but Colorado.

Do you have a cabin floor plan?  I'm working to update the front-view
instrumentation, but I don't know where everything is.  The ADS header
is helpful but not all-inclusive.  Perhaps Allen can help me, too.

Here's some more,
wx forecasts
 MSC Quebec - http://www.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/forecast/canada/qc_e.html
radar
 MSC radar - http://www.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/radar/index_e.html

The CIRA GOES-E 4km IR loop includes the AIRS region, so it's useful.
There didn't seem to be any 1-km CIRA stuff for Cleveland area.  There are
satellite imagery links off the MSC site, but I didn't explore to see if
they have loops.

No, I haven't built a floor plan but can do that -- maybe today (depending
on whether there's a flight, etc.).

Sonia,

I can give you direct URLs for data download (and other links you find
useful) if the web site continues to give you problems.

Do you have the latest version of Mozilla (version 1.5)?  I don't know
whether that's the answer, but I've been running it here at NCAR on my
Linux workstation, and all is well.

You could try playing with Mozilla's preferences, especially the
"Advanced" "Cache."  I have the browser comparing the cache and the
network "Every time I view the page."  I also set the "Link Prefetching"
checkbox.

Just as another check, you could try accessing our previous "real-time"
website for the IDEAS-3 project at the URL:
      http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/IDEAS3/
(I just added you as a user with the same default password.)  I would
expect it to have the same troubles. If so, then the problem may be due
to the way we have configured the web site.

Thanks for your input.  We'll do our best to get things working correctly
for everyone.

Ron

Hi Ron,

The website looks great.  I'm having a problem though.

I can access everything fine from my laptop, which is a Mac running OS X 
and using Netscape for a browser.

When I try to follow links on the AIRS2 website using my Dell running 
Linux and using Mozilla as a browser, it tells me "file not found".  It 
also gives me this response when I just try to log in.

I'll be downloading the data files as they become available onto my 
Dell, so I need to figure out this problem.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Sonia

Hi Ron,

Get this.  I've been waiting to get a Mozilla update, and looking for 
other browsers to try.  I *could* access the IDEAS site, and its links, 
but not the AIRS site.

I noticed that the address you gave me below for the IDEAS site had a 
slash (/) at the end.  I put one at the end of the AIRS address, and now 
all the links work!

I thought you might be interested in this info, in case others have a 
similar problem.  Bizarre!

Thanks!
Sonia

Sonia,

Thank you for letting me know.  Our system admin people supposedly made a
change so it would work either way (with or without the trailing <SLASH>),
but they obviously failed.  I'll send the word along.

I think you'll find that some other functions on the site still don't work
correctly either, like posting to the calendar or accessing the forum.
We're trying to fix it, but it could take awhile.

Ron

Ron,

Also, when will the link to the AIRS2 Weather Info Page work with our 
passwords?  Right now I can't get in.

And another question, for those of us monitoring operations mainly from 
our home institutions, when a research flight is planned on a particular 
day, will an announcement be posted on the website before the flight 
actually happens?

Thanks-- you guys are doing a good job with this!
Sonia

Sonia,

It takes a special login/password pair.  Here they are:

    Login:  AIRS2
Password:  AIRS2web

We certainly intend that.  I was expecting our project manager (Jorgen
Jensen) to do that, so I may have to remind him.  It's also possible
that he cannot add that to the web site from Cleveland, and I'll have
to do it here from NCAR.  At any rate, a test flight is occurring right
now!

To all,

As promised at todays RDP Staff Meeting:

The Canadian Met Service's Ontario Region Weaterh Centre is hosting a
special AIRS-2 web site:
     http://metapage.on.ec.gc.ca/
    Username:  AIRS2
    Password:  AIRS2web

It's quite impressive.

Can you insert the complete instrument list in the AIRS2 web site; I can only 
see the generic list with state, microphysics, etc. (7 in all).

Thanks, Jorgen

Jorgen,

I updated the list without any status, but it now has all the separate
instruments you gave me last week.

Hi Ron,

Yes, I think that we should distribute the ROPI files; in fact, I saw that you 
already have added some of them to the web page. I did respond directly to 
Greg, and sorry if you were not cc'ed.

I will try to forward the ROI files from RF1 and (soon) RF02 from here 
to /jnet/data, and maybe you can make them accessible from the web site as 
well.

We are still trying to get set up with many things, so there have been some 
delays in data processing, emails, etc.

Cheers, Jorgen

Ron,

I just tried to log on, with and without the exclamation point.  I was
unsuccessful.

The error message was as follows:

File Not Found



The document you requested cannot be found on this server. 
You may have typed the URL incorrectly, or perhaps the page has been deleted
or moved.
We hope one of the hyperlinks below may help you. 
Any suggestions?

Hi Ron,

It's Peter at Mirabel ground. We see the C130 performing its spiral descent.
I'm also following the real-time data plots. Would it be possible to add a
2nd lon,lat plot centred on YMX with +/-40km extents?

Oh and I was unsuccessful login as per below.

Thanks, Peter

John,

Sorry you're having such problems.

Here's a thought:  Have you been using a <SLASH> character to the end
of the URL:
    http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/AIRS2/

Some have found this to "fix" the web site for them.  If you're already
doing that, then I'll await your new account request.  I assume you will
be doing that from the "create one" link on the home page.  Once you are
a registered user, I must change your status to "Participant" for you to
be able to gain access to some special access links, like "Online Chat."

To all,

As promised at todays RDP Staff Meeting:

The Canadian Met Service's Ontario Region Weaterh Centre is hosting a
special AIRS-2 web site:
     http://metapage.on.ec.gc.ca/
    Username:  AIRS2
    Password:  AIRS2web

It's quite impressive.

Ron,
Thank you for your reply.  I am forecasting for the AIRS2 project with Ben
Bernstein.  My thinking was that I could use his login to get into the
chat room during the flight when he leaves next week.  However, he will
likely also still be logging in from home to keep up with things I'll
probably need my own login.  I was attempting to use his password
yesterday and that's when I was getting the error page.  I can see the
realtime C-130 data with no problems, it's the chatting capability that I
don't have.  When I try to log in as Ben I get directed to the page:
raf.atd.ucar.edu/user.php and it says File Not Found and refers me to the
webmaster.  This is on Internet Explorer on a Windows 2000 system.  Would
it be possible for you set me up with my own login?  I apologize for not
asking for it earlier in the project.  Could you also possibly give me
some direction for getting the chat feature working?  I realize that
you're probably plenty busy today because of the power outage so whenever
you have time to get to this is fine.  I probably won't need to chat until
tomorrow or Friday.  I could also call you at a convenient time.  Thank
you very much for your help.

Cory

When I try to log in on the AIRS2 RAF site for chatting, etc. I get directed to a page that says the requested page is not found.  Any ideas what might be happening?  Thank you.

Ron,
Thank you for adding me to those systems.  There are still a couple of
problems.  I am on a laptop running Linux as the operating system.  In
there I am able to log in normally using the new account you set up.  I am
not sure if I will be able to chat though because it's Linux.  Do you know
if I can make this work?
I also tried logging into my account on a couple of Windows machines
around here.  One is Win2000 and the other is WinXP and they are both
running Internet Explorer.  I get sent to an error page whenever I try to
log in on them.  Any ideas?  If the chat won't work on Linux then those
are my only other options right?  Thanks for any help you can provide.

Cory

Cory,

I set you up with a separate AIRS2 account:
      http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/AIRS2/
      Login:  cwolff
   Password:  ChangeMe!
I recommend you change the password, since it's generic.  Also,
I recommend you use a new password, one you are not currently
using for any NCAR system.

Once you're logged in, you will see an "Online Chat" link appear under
the "Collaboration" heading on the left side.  After clicking on that,
a new frame will appear with a "Chat" button to the right of your name.
Click on that, and you're chatting.  One note:  if you leave that page,
either by going back or linking to a new page, your chat session ends.
I suggest that you open a separate browser window exclusively for chatting.

I also added you to our moderated AIRS2 email list.

Let me know how it works for you.

Ron

Cory,

First, you should have no trouble chatting via the web browser, since
it is treated like any other web page.  I am writing to you from a Linux
desktop, and I have "xchat" loaded on it.  I normally use "xchat" from
within the NCAR firewall, and I've had no problems with it.  ("xchat"
won't work in Cleveland.)  However, I also can chat from my web browser
(Mozilla 1.5) without problems.  (I use "xchat," because I use it to log
the session.  I'm sure it will work with any reasonably current Linux web
browser.

Second, when accessing our AIRS2 site, please be sure to use the trailing
<SLASH> character at the end.  Something quirky happens if it's omitted.
I'm not sure if you can have two or more logins to the same user.  That
also may make the web site act funny.

What is the specific error page you get when using IE?

Also, are you here at NCAR, or are you on site?

Ron

When I try to log in on the AIRS2 RAF site for chatting, etc. I get directed to
a page that says the requested page is not found.  Any ideas what might be
happening?  Thank you.

----- End forwarded message -----
Cory,

When you specify the URL for the AIRS2 web site, please use a trailing <SLASH>
character.  That may fix your problem (unless you've been doing that already.)
    http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/AIRS2/

We are aware that certain pages will not work for some people because of
firewall issues.  We have yet to figure out a way to fix it.  Since you're
inside the UCAR perimeter, I'm surprised you're having trouble.

(I would have replied to you sooner, but I was at ML for two meetings.)

Ron,
I'm on site in Ottawa providing forecasts and guidance.  I tried the
trailing '/' this morning and it seemed to work fine on Explorer.  Thanks
for your help.

Hi Ron,

Can you set up Dave Marcotte so that he can access our real-time chat + data
while they are flying?

Thanks, Jorgen

Hi dave,

We have had some communications problems with NCAR due to the wind-strom, power
outages + a plane clipping power wires at ATD. 

I have asked Ron Ruth to set up the account. Hope that it will work,

Cheers, Jorgen

Dave,

I set up an account for you on our AIRS-II web site:
      http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/AIRS2/             <-- use trailing <SLASH> !

     Login:   dave.marcotte
  Password:  ChangeMe!

After logging in, please use the "My Account" link to change your password.

The "Online Chat" link will be on the left side under "Collaboration."
Once you click on the link, a new frame will appear with a "Chat" button
next to your name.  Click on it, and you're in.

Please be aware that if you leave the browser window (either via the
"back" button or by going to a new web page), your chat session will end.
Therefore, I suggest that you open a separate browser window just for that
purpose.

Hope to see you chatting on our next flight.

Ron

Jeff,

Allen told me you need login information for the AIRS-2 Web Site to access
the Online Chat.

Here is your Username/Password for accessing the AIRS-II Web Site:
    Username:  stith
    Password:  ChangeMe!

Please login and change this password at your earliest convenience.
Clicking on the "My Account" link on the left side will take you to
a page with a "Change your info" link.  Click on that, and on the new
web page you can change your password at the very bottom.

If you have any trouble with the site, please let me know, including
details (what page you were trying to access, etc.).

FYI, the chat line today for RF07 has been inactive.  No one from the
C-130 is chatting.  At 9:23, hercules-c130 and grendel-c130 joined,
but they both quit with "Ping timeout" about 9:36 with only one message
(asking John Cowan about chat).

Janet,

On the IDEAS3 web site, my "Data Access" html file:
     /net/www/docs/raf/Projects/IDEAS3/data_access.html
has a link
"CPI and MCR Data and Software  -- Viewing Instructions and Data Download Links"
to your html file:
     /net/www/docs/raf/ION/html/cpi-mcrdata.html
In that file on lines 35 and 37 you specify the ftp download path which
points to the AIRS2 data path instead of IDEAS3.

The file
    /net/www/docs/raf/ION/html/cpidata.html
referenced in the AIRS2 web site also points (correctly) to the AIRS2
data files.

I remember you changed things for AIRS2, but since there are no MCR
data there, you created that second html file.  So I guess the first
file now only needs to be used for IDEAS3.

Joe/Ron/Janet,

I understand that they are having some chat problems in AIRS.  I did 
restart the mysql daemon manually after the power outages, but I did not 
know that pircd also needed to be restarted -- Ron, was this always the 
case?  When I went to test the chat via the AIRS-2 web site, my screen 
had a black background (it is usually white) which seemed odd.  I 
noticed the following result from a "ps ax |grep irc" on syrah:

8 syrah:/etc/rc.d-> ps ax |grep pircd
 2921 pts/9    S      0:00 /bin/bash ./pircd restart
 2922 pts/9    S      0:01 initlog -q -c /opt/pircd/pircd -l /var/log/pircd
 2923 pts/9    S      0:10 /usr/bin/perl /opt/pircd/pircd -l /var/log/pircd
28142 pts/17   S      0:00 grep pircd

and then I checked and found no file called /var/log/pircd.  So, I did a 
"touch /var/log/pircd" and then restarted the daemon with a 
"/etc/rc.d/init.d/pircd restart" on syrah.  After this, when I went to 
chat, my background was white again.  The log file is still completely 
empty, though.  Weird.

Anyway,  when I talked to Ron, he was unsure if it was related to 
changes made to the satcom antenna, but I thought I'd look into the 
server stuff, too.  Maybe we can give it another try now?  Have people 
been able to chat from within ATD on the ground (using a combination of 
xchat and the web chat)?

Mike

Janet/Ron,

Just a followup on my message last night.  I did try to chat in two 
separate windows (there I go talking to myself again ;-) and it seemed 
to work.  Then I noticed gaps in the ION time series data from 
yesterday's flight.  So it looks like they are having some satcom 
dropout problems?!?  Hardware (not software) fails again!

Mike

Mike,

Chat has been working locally virtually all the time.  When last week's
power failure occurred, pircd didn't get restarted until I manually
restarted it (via sudo).  Since then, Joe added autostart for it when
syrah reboots, so hopefully that won't be a problem any more.

I agree with you re hardware.  At this point I'm afraid people are going
to have to choose between WSI and chat, because chat is losing now.

Mike,

Could there be a problem with the NCAR RAS?  I wonder if their timeout
could be short, so any loss in signal would drop the line.  Should I
contact SCD to see if that could be part of the trouble?  (I'm not sure
what SCD could do to help.)

Just wondering.

Mike,

In my Linux version of xchat, use:

Top menu:   User Modes
Settings:   Auto ReConnect to Server  (check on)
            Never-Give-Up ReConnect   (check on)
            Auto Open Dialog Windows  (check on)

Ron,

I think it would be worthwhile to check into it to see if SCD changed 
anything.  I think that is what we're looking for since it was working 
OK and then suddenly failed.

Janet,

The login from the airplane is not "ads."

Do you know exactly which SCD login name is used?

Donnie from NETS will then get us the log entries.

John,

Ron and Janet have kept me informed about the chat problems you're 
having out there.  As you've heard, everything on the server end appears 
to be working.  Ron is checking into the RAS to see if there are clues 
there since, even though the message is "Disconnected (Remote host 
closed socket)", it still could actually be a RAS disconnect that has 
nothing to do with the server.

One thing we all agreed would be nice aside from what Janet has already 
relayed to you is that the chat client machines should be set to 
automatically reconnect to the chat server if the connection is 
dropped.  From Ron, here are instructions on how to do this, but since 
there are a variety of clients, YMMV and the settings may be named 
differently.

Top menu:   User Modes
Settings:   Auto ReConnect to Server  (check on)
            Never-Give-Up ReConnect   (check on)
            Auto Open Dialog Windows  (check on)

In any event, this should help us diagnose the problem and prevent you from having to do anything with the chat clients onboard (such as restart them) if a disconnect should occur.  Please let us know if this is successful.

Hope other things are going well for you,
Mike

hi ron,

after reviewing the log i see nothing particulary out of the ordinary. 
now, in this case ordinary is a relative term. there is a 
disproportionate number of "Lost Carrier" disconnects compared to 
"normal" users who are dialing in from home. given that your people are 
using a satellite phone, many disconnects are not out of the ordinary 
and are in fact indicative of this type of connection. typical speeds 
you are getting are 4800 bps each direction. occasionally you get 
connections up around 21Kbps.

the data does not appear to show a difference in the percentage of 
successful connection attempts both before and after the power outage up 
here. of course, this was eyeballed and not strictly calculated.

i've attached the ras logs for november concerning the user "rafgs1". 
this is a somewhat unwieldy text file but i encourage you to look at it 
if you want more information. things to look/grep for:

disc-cause=1  <-- normal user request disconnect = good
disc-cause=2  <-- carrier disconnect = bad

please look this over and if you continue to have questions, don't 
hesitate to ask! i'm leaving for today but i'll be happy to get back to 
you on monday.

Janet,

Here is the RAS log in case you're interested.  I'm not sure what all
of the attachement fields are, but Donnie does explain two disconnect
modes (good/bad).  Seeing all the lost connections makes me wonder how
we will ever be able to chat reliably.

Ron

hi ron,

after reviewing the log i see nothing particulary out of the ordinary.
now, in this case ordinary is a relative term. there is a
disproportionate number of "Lost Carrier" disconnects compared to
"normal" users who are dialing in from home. given that your people are
using a satellite phone, many disconnects are not out of the ordinary
and are in fact indicative of this type of connection. typical speeds
you are getting are 4800 bps each direction. occasionally you get
connections up around 21Kbps.

the data does not appear to show a difference in the percentage of
successful connection attempts both before and after the power outage up
here. of course, this was eyeballed and not strictly calculated.

i've attached the ras logs for november concerning the user "rafgs1".
this is a somewhat unwieldy text file but i encourage you to look at it
if you want more information. things to look/grep for:

disc-cause=1  <-- normal user request disconnect = good
disc-cause=2  <-- carrier disconnect = bad

please look this over and if you continue to have questions, don't
hesitate to ask! i'm leaving for today but i'll be happy to get back to
you on monday.

donnie

Thanks for the info.  I'm sure it will be a great help to us.

Donnie,

How about giving me the RAS log entries for "rafgs1" from about 7:00 a.m.
today until noon MST.  It looks like we have a much better connection with
fewer drops than our previous flights.  I plan to compare the drops with
aircraft weather encounters and attitude angle (pitch, roll, etc.) shifts.

Thanks.

Ron

here is what i have for your user, attached as "raf.log". the decode

apply. let me know if there's anything else you need.
