Dec 01 11:59:37 <georgeisaac>	Are you still planning on going to Mirabel.  The Convair is going to take off around 1945Z and work the snowsqualls over Georgian Bay, just north of where you are presently.

Dec 01 14:12:27 <ruth>	Hi John.  Looks like the C-130 satellite linke is really unstable today.

Dec 01 14:13:23 <ruth>	Hi John.  Looks like the C-130 satellite link is really unstable today.

Dec 01 14:14:06 <cowan-hotel>	Hi Ron.  Is it just chat or is ION being unstable as well?
Dec 01 14:15:11 <ruth>	I haven't monitored ION that closely, but the XY track looks OK.  Let me take a peek at the time-series plot
Dec 01 14:15:11 <cowan-hotel>	We see the track plot and it looks okay from here.
Dec 01 14:17:36 <cowan-hotel>	From the look of it they got into some icing.  The track plot looks good as well.
Dec 01 14:18:41 <cowan-hotel>	I did a test today and found out that the Ping time from the C-130 to that chat host and back was between 1 and 4 seconds. Could that be part of the trouble?
Dec 01 14:19:55 <cowan-hotel>	I also talked to Larry on the flight and he was having trouble getting the chat on Hercules to restart. I will be interested to see what he says when he gets back.
Dec 01 14:20:38 <ruth>	John, no major dropouts noticeable in the time-series plots either, after a brief check.
Dec 01 14:21:11 <blanc-c130>	Hi, John and Ron, glad to hear that data transmission is OK.
Dec 01 14:21:23 <cowan-hotel>	I also had a thought that since chat is running through AC tracker is it only getting sent out once a second like the data packets.
Dec 01 14:21:53 <cowan-hotel>	Yes the data look good from here. Are you heading back soon?
Dec 01 14:22:29 <ruth>	Ping times of 1 sec may be normal.  I would hope that timeouts contolling hangup would be a lot longer, but I have no idea if/where set.
Dec 01 14:23:57 <cowan-hotel>	I have not seen anywhere to set the timeout on the chat servers.  The Ion stream is not effected since it's just downlinking the data to you.  Maybe Janet or Mike D knows how long the pings can be.
Dec 01 14:24:12 <--	blanc-c130 has quit (Ping timeout)
Dec 01 14:24:34 <cowan-hotel>	Generally the ping time was at least 1.5 to 3 seconds with times of 5 to 8 seconds being seen.

Dec 01 14:29:38 <cowan-hotel>	Looks like the plane got into some nice icing today..???
Dec 01 14:32:48 <cowan-hotel>	Well I have to head back to the airport.  I will let everyone know when we get there.
Dec 01 14:32:57 <cowan-hotel>	Bye fior now.

Dec 01 14:33:47 <blanc-c130>	Yes, icing OK/moderate only. Still not returning to base.
Dec 01 14:33:47 <blanc-c130>	Convair is below us - somewhere.

Dec 01 15:26:11 <cowan>	They are about 15 Min out.  I am logging out for the night.
Dec 01 15:27:07 <cowan>	Looks like the mean time of login for Blanc was about 5 to 10 minutes.
Dec 01 15:27:45 <cowan>	I will look as to why Hercules was not trying to re-establish chat on it's own when the plane gets in tonight or tommorow.
Dec 01 15:28:15 <cowan>	Ron If you have any infor please let me know.
