Ron, 

I got back the print messages from all of the tape stages for FIB, and only
two of them worked.  10 of them had "uncrecoverable fatal errors", and a 
couple others seem to be longer than 195 MBytes.

I don't know what to do from here.  Could you look at the files?  They are in
my ~sloss/genpro/fib directory, and are the SLOSSprint# files.

I appreciate any help you can offer about this.

Thanks.

Thanks for the help.

RF01 doesn't exist, so there is no job for it.

About all the -B6500's, I copied those lines out of a coare job file, and I
didn't realize that that option was there.  I will go back and re-edit the
file and resubmit it this afternoon, except RF03.

Thanks.

I am curious why the tapes are staging so quickly -- they seem to be reading
in very few records into the files, like only 6 or 7 hundred at a time per
tape.  This doesn't seem quite right for 4 hour flights, even on the king-air.

If you have any ideas, let me know, like if not all of the files on the tapes
are actually being read or something.

Thanks.

Ron, 

I retrieved the last printjob file (SLOSSprint23) for RF03, and I can't tell
if it actually finished or not.  it read 6700 records, wrote almost 195 MB, 
but I don't know if it stopped there, or finished, or what.  

It is in my /sloss/genpro/fib directory.  When you get a chance, could you look
at it and see if it requires another segment to run?  If so, should I rename
the first half to RF03A?

Thanks.

PS:

I looked at the file again, and it failed to terminate normally, and says that
it didn't close the bitfile properly.  Does that mean that it didn't write the
file afterall?

Joel,

My guess is that NO bitfile was written because it read more than 195Mbytes.
You need to separate it into two jobs:  RF03A and RF03B.  On the first one,
read 6500 records and no file mark.  On the second one skip 6500 records and
read to EOF.  You should have examples of each of these.  Just submit them as
separate jobs waiting for one to finish before submitting the other one.

Joel,

You may use guint to stage the tapes, but it may take longer to set up than
you want.  Do any of them exceed 195 Mbytes in size?  If so, you need to break
the jobs up into pieces.  So it may be easier for you to start with an extant
file and modify it for your use.  A suitable example would be:
          /home/local/genpro/projects/coare/tp2ms.817job2

Change the account number to have the correct tail number of the plane.  Then
duplicate the lines for each flight/segment (according to our file-naming
principles) and change appropriate tape numbers and path names.  Even though
they are low-density tapes, I'd recommending using the high-density drives
(QD), since there are more of them and the staging should go faster.

If you've forgotten the naming convention, just remember that, for these ADS
tapes, there is never a segment with more than one letter (e.g., NO RF01AA).
If you want, I can specify the MSS path names for you.

Tell Sue Jensen to inform you when the tapes are ready.  Then, just before you
submit the staging job, send email to 'tapelist@ncar' with the list of tapes
you are going to use (and your name, in case they need to contact you) to let
the operators know that a bunch of ExaByte mounts are coming.

I'll get to them just after lunch.  I'm working on getting a 3-226 job sent to
the Cray for Bruce Morley.  More than likely the failures could be due to a
lack of EOFs as well as the 195Mbyte boundary.  I'll review them and let you
know what to do next.

It's also possible that the new MSCP installed yesterday could have something
to do with things.

You made some mistakes, obviously, but your requests found at least one tape
with a problem, which is good.

If a tape for RF01 exists, you'll need to set up a job for it.

For flights RF05 - RF14, you need to remove the -B6500 option from the msimport
command and resubmit them.  RF11 may fail again; if it does so at record #193,
I'd set up a job that deletes the msimport option -N1 and adds the option
-R192.  If there is reason to believe that more data exist than msimport wants
to read, we should bring the tape back to Jeffco for analysis.

For RF03, it appears that you wrote the second part.  What is strange to me is
the MSS report said a total of 6731 records were read and written to the MSS.
If records are skipped (as you had requested), the usual report shows many more
records and bytes read that were written.  I'll send this to Kathy Fryberger
for analysis.  Perhaps you should not resubmit RF03A until I get word back from
her.  As a preparatory measure, change the msimport command to create
.../RF03A/... by skipping zero records (omit -B6500) and reading 6500 records
(-R6500) and no files (omit -N1).  If I find that the first stage was
successful, I'll rename the RF03 you created to be RF03B.

Joel,

You may ask Krista or Ed Brown how long the flights lasted.  With 600-700
records you're getting about an hour or a little longer.  Typically there
is only one file per tape with ExaBytes.  It could be that the tapes'
characteristics have changed and they cannot be read beyond that point.
Did anyone give you a log of all the flights and their lengths?  You can
compare that with 6-seconds per record.

Joel,

I looked at all the files.  Apparently, ...print0 through ...print12 are
leftovers from previous runs.  I'd get rid of them.

At present there are bitfiles in the /RAF/1992/280 directory for the following
flights:  RF02, RF04 - RF14.

RF07 seems a bit short in length, but it is probably OK.

The SLOSSprint1 file showed a problem with RF03.  It was one of the early tries
where you asked it to skip 6500 records then read to EOF.  It seems to have
read 6731 records before quitting.  The summary shows that it found an EOF, but
it apparently did that before the 6500 records were skipped.  I would resubmit
that job to just read one file like you did with the others.

If I recall correctly, there was no RF01.

Otherwise, it looks like FIB staging is in good shape.

         Quick Overview of NIMBUS Production Processing Procedures
            for Project Managers and Data Management Personnel
        -----------------------------------------------------------
                           Ronald L. Ruth
                          RAF Data Manager
                           rev. Mar 1997
        -----------------------------------------------------------

  Note:  Production processing is unique.  Do not use the `nimbus' login
          unless you are prepared to set up and perform production (final)
          processing.

 A)  The master raw ADS data tapes need to be archived to the SCD Mass Store
      System (MSS).  Make sure this is done before doing any production
      processing.  (See Ron for assistance.)
 B)  Peruse the entire project's data using quick-look tools.  Identify all
      changes that are needed for production processing.
   1)  Use whatever tools you want, including NIMBUS, ncplot, WINDS, PV-Wave,
        MATLAB, Xanadu, etc.
   2)  Make a list of instrument anomalies, failures, etc., that occurred
        during the project.
   3)  Make a list of equipment changes made during the project.
   4)  Edit the `Defaults' file in the project's directory
        (`hl proj/### ; vi Defaults') to make changes that reflect the
        typical flight.  (This file has reference constants used for
        making derived calculations.)
   5)  Make a list of per-flight changes needed for production.  Examples
        include:  new calibrations, reference variable substitutions, unique
        Defaults values.
   6)  Using information from B)5), create groups of flights which all need
        the same setup and whose processing will be identical.  (A group
        consists of one or more flights.)  Select one reference flight from
        each group.
   7)  If you use NIMBUS during this time, be sure to use your own login (not
        the `nimbus' login).  You may want to save setup files in your own
        processing directory.  (Make a list of those you want to recall for
        production processing.)
   8)  Completely summarize all the information needed for production
        processing (basically, all the above information); put it in a
        Project Production Setup document (or file); and send a copy to Ron.
        (Include the project's instrumentation list and ADS setup table.)
 C)  Set up NIMBUS for the default, low-rate processing (no matter what the
      final output rate will be).
   1)  Login as user `nimbus.'  See Chris Webster or Ron if you need the
        password.
   2)  Change to the project's directory (`hl proj/###'). 
   3)  Edit the `Production/FlightGroups' file to agree with B)6).  See Chris
        or Ron if you need help with this.
   4)  Edit the `DependTable' file to make changes that reflect the typical
        flight.  (This file determines the reference variables used for
        the derived calculations.)
   5)  If you will be doing high-rate processing later, make appropriate
        changes to the project's LowRateVars file, if necessary.  (This file
        determines which derived variables are to be unconditionally output
        at low rate.)
   6)  Please make sure that the project's VarDB file is up to date.  You
        may have to add and/or change extended definitions to the variable
        dictionary (using the command:  `vared VarDB').
   7)  Get the reference raw ADS data sets from the MSS.  One can use the
        "msget" or "msgetads" script for this.  If a data set is split into
        contiguous segments, retrieve all of them.  NIMBUS will process the
        entire flight as one output file by sequentially reading each ADS
        data set.
   8)  Run NIMBUS with each reference flight to create the reference setup
        files.  Refer to the ADS Reference Manual, Chapter 5, or the NIMBUS
        `walkthrough' document (located in the `nimbus' home directory), if
        necessary.
     a)  If present, load appropriate setup file from B)6) above, and check to
          make sure it makes no inappropriate changes.  (It can change rates,
          defaults, calibration coefficients, dependencies, variable output
          on/off.)  Multiple setup files can be loaded, one after another in
          case multiple changes are necessary.
     b)  From within NIMBUS, edit the Defaults file, if necessary.
     c)  Make appropriate changes to the calibration coefficients.
     d)  Make appropriate changes to the dependencies.
     e)  Carefully choose which variables are to be output to or omitted
          from the production netCDF file.
     f)  Be sure all output rates are correct.
     g)  Save the setup.  (You will not be asked for a setup file name,
          since, in production mode, it is predefined.)
     h)  Repeat for the next reference data set, if necessary.
 D)  Preproduction test
   1)  Make one production run using a representative flight.
     a)  The output data set will be put in the directory
          `/home/productiondata,' and its name will follow the prescribed
          naming convention:  ppptFnn[H].cdf  (Example:  120rf03b.cdf)
          where:  ppp = 3-digit project number
                    t = type of flight (f=ferry, r=research, t=test)
                   nn = flight number and possible segment letter
                         (e.g., 03b)
                  [h] = suffix letter to indicate high-rate data
                         (Example:  120rf03bh.cdf)
   2)  Peruse the production log file in the project's `Production'
        subdirectory created during the NIMBSU run.  (See Ron for help,
        if needed.)
   3)  Peruse the netCDF header.  (Use `ncdump -h <file> | more'.)
     a)  Make sure that the variable list is correct.
     b)  Make sure that no variable has "units" of "Unk" or "Unknown" and
          "long_name" of "No title".  If any do exist, repeat step C)8).
          (Within the `more' comand, use the `vi'-like command:  "/Unk" and
          "/No title" to find them.)
   4)  Review output data using ncplot, WINDS or other available tools.
   5)  Note changes that are needed to the processing, and rerun, if
        necessary.  Update the associated setup file.
   6)  Repeat this section using the reference example from each flight group.
 E)  Production
   1)  When all is ready for production, check available disk space to make
       sure that room exists for the processed data.  (You may have to do
       production runs in sections and have the output data archived before
       continuing.  Also, other project processing may compete for the
       available disk space which may require negotiation with other users.)
   2)  Use NIMBUS to process each flight/segment.
     a)  NIMBUS now has automatic output file naming, and if a flight has
          to be processed in segments, one must rename each output file to
          add the segment's letter, for example, 120rf05.cdf --> 120rf05a.cdf.
     b)  If necessary, rename the production log file for this segment, too.
          It will be located in the project's `Production' subdirectory.
     c)  Thoroughly peruse the output from each production run, looking for
          errors and things overlooked in setup.
     d)  When flight/segments have been processed to your satisfaction, have
          Ron archive the output files to the MSS.  (This may have to be done
          in sections if disk space is at a premium.)  It is recommended that
          all the low-rate files be archived before commencing with high-rate
          production processing.
 F)  If high-rate processing is required, repeat steps D) and E), but
      select the `high-rate' button in the NIMBUS window before starting
      the processing.
   1)  You may need to make alterations to the setup.  One example would be
        setting the output rates for variables like VEW and VNS to 10 sps.
        A separate and independent setup file could be loaded to make these
        changes (and set the "high-rate" flag, too).  (For an example, see
        the file `HRT.convert' in the `870/Production' directory.)
   2)  NIMBUS now has automatic production output file naming, so one should 
        not have to rename the low-rate output file to avoid overwriting
        extant data.
   3)  Check a representative sample of high-rate, processed data using
        appropriate tools.  (This may include spectrum analysis.)
 G)  When all data have been processed to your satisfaction and archived to
      the MSS, prepare the final documentation binder(s) for shipment to the
      Principal Investigator(s).
 H)  Determine the type of output product(s) needed by PI(s) and schedule RDP
      to copy and ship the output data.  (See Ron for instructions.)

Ron,

Thanks for all the processing information.  Thanks also for saving the existing 
project 280 files for me.  After they have been archived to the mass store (or 
moved somewhere else), you may delete the following files:

280DF11.cdf      280HR11.cdf.gz   280RF13.cdf.gz
280HR12.cdf.gz   280RF14.cdf.gz

Teresa,

All the files have been archived to the SCD Mass Store System, so I have
deleted the files you mentioned.  Since your names didn't conform to RAF's
current naming convention, I renamed them so I could more easily archive
them.  Below is a map that relates your original file names to the MSS
bitfile names and, for those files that were not deleted, their names in
the "/home/productiondata/old280/" directory.

I have fixed up all the file ownerships in the project "280" directory and
subdirectories that pertian to NIMBUS processing, so you should be able to
set up everything correctly.

Call, visit or write if you have questions or problems or if you need any
assistance.

Hi Ron,

Here is a list of the files which currently reside in the old280 subdirectory 
of productiondata and should be saved to the mass store.  You will notice that
the files with an Apr 11 creation date have already been saved, and thus may
be removed.  There also several extraction scripts which may be removed, since
I have copies saved elsewhere.  

I also agree with you that it would make sense to change the current MS 
directory names from OLDHRT -> HRT and OLDLRT -> LRT.

Thanks much for your patience in this matter!

Teresa

Teresa,

I have archived to the SCD Mass Store System (MSS) the files you requested
in your recent email:
  Source directory:       mistral:/home/productiondata/old280/
  Destination directory:  MSS:/RAF/1992/280/
      280rf02.cdf  -->  LRT/RF02.cdf
      280rf02h.cdf -->  HRT/RF02.cdf
      20rf02ah.cdf -->  HRT/RF02A.cdf
      280rf04.cdf  -->  LRT/RF04.cdf
      280rf04h.cdf -->  HRT/RF04.cdf
      20rf04ah.cdf -->  HRT/RF04A.cdf
      280rf06.cdf  -->  LRT/RF06.cdf
      280rf06h.cdf -->  HRT/RF06.cdf
      20rf06ah.cdf -->  HRT/RF06A.cdf
      280rf07.cdf  -->  LRT/RF07.cdf
      280rf07h.cdf -->  HRT/RF07.cdf
      20rf07ah.cdf -->  HRT/RF07A.cdf
      280rf09h.cdf -->  HRT/RF09.cdf
      20rf09ah.cdf -->  HRT/RF09A.cdf
      280rf10.cdf  -->  LRT/RF10.cdf
      280rf10h.cdf -->  HRT/RF10.cdf
      20rf10ah.cdf -->  HRT/RF10A.cdf
I took the liberty to change file names beginning with "20r" to "280r,"
since it was obviously some kind of typo.  To efficiently do the archiving,
I first moved them from the "old280" subdirectory into the main one.

I also moved the following MSS bitfiles as we had agreed:
  Source directory:       MSS:/RAF/1992/280/
  Destination directory:  MSS:/RAF/1992/280/
    OLDHRT/RF05.cdf     --> HRT/RF05.cdf
    OLDHRT/RF05A.cdf    --> HRT/RF05A.cdf
    OLDHRT/RF08.cdf     --> HRT/RF08.cdf
    OLDHRT/RF08A.cdf    --> HRT/RF08A.cdf
    OLDHRT/RF11.cdf     --> HRT/RF11.cdf
    OLDHRT/RF12.cdf     --> HRT/RF12.cdf
    OLDHRT/RF13.cdf     --> HRT/RF13.cdf
    OLDHRT/RF14.cdf     --> HRT/RF14.cdf
    OLDLRT/RF05.cdf     --> LRT/RF05.cdf
    OLDLRT/RF08.cdf     --> LRT/RF08.cdf
    OLDLRT/RF09.cdf     --> LRT/RF09.cdf
    OLDLRT/RF11.cdf     --> LRT/RF11.cdf
    OLDLRT/RF12.cdf     --> LRT/RF12.cdf
    OLDLRT/RF13.cdf     --> LRT/RF13.cdf
    OLDLRT/RF14.cdf     --> LRT/RF14.cdf
    OLDLRT/RF11OLDER.cdf --> OLDLRT/RF11.cdf

An updated MSS bitfile directory listing can be found in the file:
  /home/local/proj/msfiles/msls.280

I am presently in the process of updating the master RAF MSS bitfile
directory so the "msget" scripts can find them.  It should be ready
before the end of the day today.

I got the impression that, once archived, you do not require ANY of the
project 280 files to remain in the "productiondata" directory.  Please
let me know whether or not this is the case.

Thanks.

Ron,

I'm writing to request that some ASCII and netCDF files be added to the FIB
(project 280) archives on the mass store.  As soon as the files are saved and
I am able to ftp the ASCII files to the Forest Service, I will delete them.
If space on /home/data becomes a problem, please let me know and we can work
something out.  I would be able to free up space immediately, but the FS
computers are off line until sometime within the next 2 weeks.  Let me know
what will work for you.  Also please let me know where the files end up on
the mass store.  Thanks very much for your help and patience,

Teresa

Teresa,

I already archived HRT files to the SCD Mass Store System (MSS) that seem
equivalent to ones with the above names.  They are different, though, because
they have different sizes.  Our normal names for these HRT data files are:
   /RAF/1992/280/HRT/RF11.cdf
   /RAF/1992/280/HRT/RF12.cdf
   /RAF/1992/280/HRT/RF13.cdf
   /RAF/1992/280/HRT/RF14.cdf

Please let me know if you want your new data files to supersede (overwrite)
the ones presently on the MSS or if you want them saved in addition to the
ones presently on the MSS.  (If the latter, we have to devise a naming
scheme for them.)

For all the files you have listed below, I can create an ASCII subdirectory
in the project 280 area and save these files with names very similar to
what you have given them.  I will remove the 280, since the main directory
structure has that designation already.  Here is an example:

   "/home/tmp/campos/280rf02.track.lwc.asc"  will be archived as
   .../280rf02.track.lwc.asc --> /RAF/1992/280/ASCII/rf02.track.lwc.asc

 If you don't like this naming convention, please let me know, and I'll
consider something you suggest.

> 	/home/tmp/campos/280rf13.track.lwc.asc
> 	/home/tmp/campos/280rf14.track.lwc.asc

The files below have HR and TR as part of their names.  Do they have
significance?  Normally "RF##" appears in our naming convention for
research flights.  Due to the special nature of these files, however
I'm not terribly worried about their names.  It would be nice if you
could create a README file that describes each of the files.  I would
archive that in the ASCII subdirectory along with all these *.asc files.

If all goes well, I can probably archive them early next week.  I'm a bit
swamped with data this week.

Ron,

Thanks for your quick response.  I am ftp-ing the files to the Forest Service
now, so it will probably be okay to remove them as soon as they are archived.
I will let you know when they are all sent.

Regarding the HRT netCDF files, there are already two sets of .cdf files
archived to the HRT directory for all flights except flights 11-14.  These
smaller files have the naming convention RF??A.cdf.  They are a small subset
of each flight's data which I use to extract the ascii information for the
forest service.  If I use the whole data file, PV-wave complains (and the
system groans).  I'm saving the subset as a time saver if I have to reproduce
my work.  Hope this is okay.

The naming conventions you recommend for the ASCII files make sense to me.
I've created README files for each flight, explaining the naming structure of
the HR and TR (as well as the a-? letter appendage) for each flight's file.
I will move these to my /home/tmp/campos directory for your convenience in
archiving them.  The significance of the naming conventions TR and HR are as
follows:
	TR implies low rate time variables (hour minute second)
	HR imlies high rate variables
For some reason the FS wanted them separate if I remember correctly.

If you need anything else, please let me know.  Thanks again,

Teresa

Ron,

I omitted one set of HRT ascii files from my previous request.  Please add the
following files to the pile.  (I've also moved a README file for this flight
into the /home/tmp/campos directory for your convenience.)
	/home/data/280HR09[a-f].asc
	/home/data/280TR09[a-f].asc

Thanks,

Teresa

Teresa,

I have archived all the files you requested to the SCD Mass Store System
(MSS).  I also archived some of the README files I found there.  Following
is a list of the original file names followed by their MSS bitfile names.
I basically created an /RAF/1992/280/ASCII directory to hold all the ASCII
files and the few README files.  The 4 new netCDF files were put into our
standard directory with a suffix letter A to keep them from interfering
with your original versions.

We now can delete these data from RAF's disks.

Teresa,

Within the last week I recall you telling me that you have more FIB data to
