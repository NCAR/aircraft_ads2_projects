		Running and modifying dninp.eb

Running:

	1.  To output CO as both volts and ppm use the M1 command
		to add variable CO.

	2.  Add the correct calibration coefficients for the flight
		using the CA command.  Remember that the signal from
		the A to D converter is inverted so the sign of the
		slope (calcoef2) must also be inverted.



Modifying:

	1.  /home/local/amlib/user/co2c.c   contains the CO2 code.

	2.  /home/local/amlib/std/ssrd.eb.c   contains the sideslip
		correction factor (currently 0.35)

	3.  /home/local/amlib/std/init_ac_dep.eb.c   contains the modified
		radome pcor using mach number and attack (line 116)

	4.  to make a new version of dninp.eb after making modifications
		to any of the above files execute the following commands:

		cd /home/local/dap/source/input
		make -f make280
