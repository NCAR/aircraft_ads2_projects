This summary has been written to outline basic instrumentation problems
affecting the data set and is not intended to point out every bit of
questionable data.  It is hoped that this information will facilitate
use of the data as the research concentrates on specific flights and
times.

The following report is organized into three sections.  The first
section lists recurring problems, general limitations, and systematic
biases in the standard RAF measurements.  The second section lists
isolated problems occurring on a flight-by-flight basis. The third
section provides information on the special RAF supplied experimental
instrumentation.

Special pieces of both RAF and User supplied equipment were used  during
the project and have been identified in the Research Instrumentation
list included in this document.  These data require special handling and
it will be necessary to obtain access to the on-board operator notes for
this information to be of use during the analysis phase.  No attempt has
been made to evaluate the performance of that equipment in this summary.

A special DLR DIAL lidar was used to measure aerosol backscatter and
water vapor profiles.  Those data were recorded independently by the
User, and no attempt has been made to evaluate the performance of that
equipment.  Information on, and access to these data can be obtained by
contacting Dr. Gerhard Ehret at DLR through the Interned at
pa2v@dlrvn.bitnet.

An intermittent sampler was deployed by Dr. William Cooper at NCAR.  For
further details, contact Dr. Cooper at (303)497-8939.


Section I:  General Discussion

 1.  The wind data for this project were derived from measurements taken
     with the radome wind gust package.  As is the case with all wind
     gust systems, the ambient wind calculations can be adversely
     affected by either sharp changes in the aircraft's flight attitude
     of excessive drift in the on-board inertial reference system (IRS).
     Turns, or more importantly, climbing turns are particularly
     disruptive to this type of measurement technique.  Wind data
     reported for these conditions should be used with caution.

     Special sets of in-flight calibration maneuvers were conducted on
     flights 5, 9, 13, 17, 18, and 25 to aid in the performance analysis
     of the wind gust measurements.  The calibration data identified a
     systematic bias in the sideslip variables.  This offset, which
     resulted in roughly a 10 to 15 degree error in calculated wind
     direction, has been removed from the final data set.  All of the
     remaining information, including the summary of IRS performance,
     indicated that the wind measurement system was performing within
     standard RAF specifications.  The time intervals for each set of
     maneuvers have been documented in both the flight-by-flight data
     quality review (See below.) and on the individual Research Flight
     Forms prepared for each flight.

     As an additional enhancement to this data set, a correction was
     applied to the wind data using position updates provided by the GPS
     positioning system.  Both the GPS corrected and uncorrected values
     are included in the final data set.

 2.  A Trimble Global Positioning System (GPS) was used as a more
     accurate position reference during the program.  The reliability of
     this system depends upon regional coverage by the number of
     navigational satellites arrayed above the research area.  Coverage
     over the local research area was generally good during the program.
     Generally, position (GLAT, GLON) and ground speed (GSPD, GVEW,
     GVNS) were readily available, but occasional dropouts did occur.
     Such dropouts are easy to recognize and will therefore not be
     specifically identified in the flight-by-flight summary.

 3.  RAF flies redundant sensors to assure data quality.   Performance
     characteristics differ from sensor to sensor with certain units
     being more susceptible to various thermal and dynamic effects than
     others.  Good comparisons were typically obtained between the two
     standard temperatures (ATB, ATRF), three dynamic pressures (QCWC,
     QCRC, QCFC), two radiometric surface temperature sensors (RSTB,
     XKT19), and the two dew pointers (DPT, DPB).  Exceptions are noted
     in the flight-by-flight summary.  The differences observed in the
     static pressures (PSFDC, PSWC) were somewhat excessive for this
     type of project with the Model 1201 pressure transducer (PSWC)
     exhibiting even more temperature sensitivity than normal.  The
     reference pressure used in all of the derived variables (PSFDC)
     was obtained with a Model 1501 unit which was unaffected by these
     problems.

 4.  Temperature measurements were made using the standard   unheated
     (ATB) Rosemount and  NCAR reverse flow (ATRF) temperature sensors.
     These standard temperature sensors performed reasonably well,
     encountering the usual problems with sensor wetting during cloud
     passes.  A comparison of the data sets yielded an good correlation
     in instrument signatures and only small differences in absolute
     value (+-0.2C) through out the program.  A comparison of pre- and
     post-program calibrations indicated that all units maintained
     stable and independent calibrations.  Due to its reliability and
     fast response, the Rosemount temperature (ATB) was selected as the
     reference value used in calculating the derived variables.

 5.  Humidity measurements were made using two collocated thermoelectric
     dew point sensors and a Lyman-alpha fast response hygrometer.
     Generally speaking, all of the humidity sensors performed well when
     they were available.

     The bottom EG&G dew pointer (DPB, DPBC) was much less responsive
     during periods of large dew point depression than the  two-stage
     G.E. unit used in the top location (DPT, DPTC).  A number of cases
     occurred where DPB was essentially pegged out when the actual dew
     point was significantly lower.  Much of the fine scale humidity
     signature was also lost in DPB at the low dew points. Due to these
     factors, the top dew pointer (DPT, DPTC) was selected as the
     reference sensor in calculating the derived humidity variables for
     most flights.

     Lyman-alpha hygrometers are susceptible to in-flight drift in the
     instrument's bias voltage.  Due to this problem, RAF uses a special
     data processing technique to remove the bias drift by referencing
     the long term humidity values to one of the more stable
     thermoelectric dew point sensors.  This technique can result in
     occasional large spikes in the derived lyman-alpha data (RHOLA,
     MRLA). Short (2-3 sec) intervals around these spikes should be
     considered as bad data, but the remaining data points, as recorded
     on magnetic tape, will be valid.  For programs requiring routine
     cloud penetrations, the rapid changes in humidity or wetting of the
     sensor windows can trigger a reset of the coupling technique at an
     inopportune time.  Information on this technique and literature
     references on high rate humidity measurements are available in RAF
     Bulletin No. 22.

 6.  A set of upward and downward facing radiometers were used to
     measure shortwave, ultraviolet and infrared irradiance.  It should
     be noted that all units are hard mounted and that none of the data
     have been corrected for changes in the aircraft's flight attitude.
     Care should be used in identifying the aircraft attitude to
     determine a relative sun angle.

 7.  The measurement of the surface temperature was made using both a
     Barnes PRT-5 (RSTB) and a Heimann KT19 (XKT19) radiometric sensors.
     The PRT-5 measurements are typically influenced by fluctuations in
     the reference cavity temperature (TCAVB), the radiative "blackness"
     of the surface and overhead sky conditions,  and the contribution
     of water vapor in the sample volume which is moisture content and
     altitude dependent.  These somewhat complex corrections are left to
     judgement and skill of the investigator, since they must be handled
     on a case-by-case basis.  Overall, the sensor performed extremely
     well.  However, the dynamic range of the PRT-5 sensor is somewhat
     limited and a specific operating range had to be designated.  By
     targeting the instrument's range to the expected surface
     temperatures (0 to 50C), the unit's best resolution was obtained.
     However,  due to the highly variable nature of the surface
     conditions encountered  the unit's minimum limit was exceeded on a
     number of occasions.  The Heimann range is not limited but the
     measurement loses some accuracy at temperatures below 0C.   A
     comparison of the data sets yielded an good correlation in
     instrument signatures and only small differences in absolute value
     (+-0.5C) during Phase II & III of the program.  The Heimann
     radiometer was not available during Phase I.

 8.  Three types of alternate altimeter were used during the program.
     The Collins altimeter (HGM) is only functional from 0 to 780 m AGL.
     At altitudes greater than 780 m the instrument is pegged full
     scale.  The Stewart Warner altimeter (HGME) on the other hand is
     functional from 150 m to 21,000 m AGL.  At altitudes less than 150
     m the instrument's performance becomes intermittent due to
     excessive signal refections off the surface.  Care must be taken
     with HGME since the output will vary randomly but look fairly
     realistic in this altitude region.  Differences between HGME and
     the calculated pressure altitude (PALT) can be attributed to either
     surface terrain features or the typical differences between the
     surface pressure and the reference value of 1013 mbar.  The default
     surface pressure and the NACA Standard Atmospheric lapse rate were
     used in the calculation of PALT to provide an accurate comparison
     with similar computations used for measurements taken by the other
     aircraft.

     The GPS positioning system also provides an altitude readout
     (GALT).  This output requires coverage by at least four satellites
     for accurate measurements.  Due to the uncertainty in satellite
     coverage, GALT defaults back to PALT values when the fourth
     satellite is lost.  This results in periodic jumps in the value of
     GALT.  In addition, the GALT signal has been "detuned" by the
     military and may  exhibit an oscillation of +-100 m.

 9.  A hot wire liquid water sensor was used on the Electra during the
     BOREAS program.  The PMS King Probe (PLWCC) worked well during the
     program, with the exception of flights 1-8.  Special note should be
     made of the fact that this instrument is calibrated for a specific
     range of aircraft speeds.  When the speed of the aircraft falls
     outside that envelope, a shift in the zero baseline value will
     occur.  This is typically limited to takeoff and landing intervals,
     but there may be other situations where this occurs.

     Due to the nature of this sampling technique, it should be clear
     that water contained in ice particles will not be observed.  This
     fact should be taken into account when comparing data from these
     sensors with the calculated liquid water content obtained from the
     optical particle probes.

10.  The RAF was responsible for the ozone and carbon monoxide air
     chemistry measurements conducted on the Electra during the program
     (TEO3C, CO).   These occurrences are fairly obvious and have been
     identified in the flight-by-flight summary.

     CO data for RF09 - RF16

     Report by Greg Kok

     Carbon monoxide measurements were made using a modified TECO 48 CO
     analyzer.  The modifications include, enhancement of the optical
     system, thermostatic control of the optical bench, flow control of
     the sample flow, and addition of a heated Pd zero trap.  The
     instrument operates on a five minute measure cycle, followed by a
     two minute zero.  The raw signal is recorded as the variables, CO,
     and the zero/sample mode as the variables CMODE.  When CMODE is
     greater than 0.1 volts, the instrument is in the zero mode, and
     the data should be discarded.

     Data processing in done in a two-pass process.  The raw signal is
     first zero corrected, and then the zero baselined data are
     calibrated to get the final signal.  The variables COZRO is the
     zero baseline derived from fitting a cubic spline to the data when
     the instrument is in the zero mode.  This is subtracted from the CO
     signal to yield the zero corrected signal, COCOR.  A linear
     calibration is applied to this signal to give the calibrated data,
     COCAL.  The concentrations given are in ppmv.   The instrument was
     calibrated several times during the program with a standard
     cylinder of CO span gas.

     The instrument response is about 30 seconds.   Turbulence will
     increase the noise on the signal, and this is present in the BOREAS
     data.  The data are updated at 1 sps (samples per second) but needs
     to be averaged in 10- or 20-second periods for the most useful results.
     The concentrations obtained in the BOREAS program are reasonable for
     what would be expected in an environment like northern Canada.

11.  The measurement of small CN size aerosol particle concentrations
     can be influenced by two effects.  Droplet shattering during cloud
     penetrations can increase indicated CN   concentrations by several
     orders of magnitude.  For this application the CN inlet was altered
     to a reverse flow configuration.  This inlet format seems to have
     reduced  this problem significantly.  However, care should be used
     when examining the quantitative values of CONCN during the cloud
     passes.  The instrument uses Butanol to activate CN particles so
     that they can be included in the measurement process.  Indicated CN
     particle concentrations can decrease during intervals where the
     Butanol level falls below the critical level.  This is typically
     not a flight-to-flight concern as a fresh Butanol supply will
     usually last for up to 50 hours of operation.  However, scattered
     intervals of questionable data were noted during the QA review and
     have been identified in flight summaries of Section II.

12.  Generally speaking, the two PMS particle probes (FSSP, PCASP)
     worked relatively well.  Some specific details on each of the
     probes are summarized below:

     PCASP -  Aerosol concentrations measured with the PCASP probe are
     highly dependent upon the sample flow rate of the instrument.
     Recent modifications to the probe/ADS interface now allow RAF to
     monitor fluctuations in this flow rate directly (PFLW).   Generally
     speaking, the size range of the CN counter is much broader than,
     but is inclusive of the sampling range of the PCASP probe.
     Therefore, intervals where CONCP exceed the value of the CN
     concentrations (CONCN) will be suspect.

     FSSP -  The FSSP cloud droplet probe functioned extremely well
     through out the entire project.  Like all 1-D optical probes,
     however, the FSSP has no way to distinguish between ice and water.
     Therefore, the liquid water content calculated from this probe
     (PLWCF) should be used with caution in mixed phase clouds.

13.  Spectral Vegetation Radiometer (SVR) Calibration.  Background and
     results by Krista K. Laursen.  This report was prepared during
     February 1995 to aid the BOREAS investigators for deriving the
     vegetation index such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
     (NDVI).  The respective radiances of wavelength 650 nm (WV650) and
     862 nm (WV862) were recorded in the data set as voltages.

The spectral vegetation radiometer (SVR) was calibrated at RAF using the
ratio-Langley technique, which is discussed by Bannehr and Glover
(1992).  Briefly, this calibration method involves making direct
measurements of the SVR output voltage under clear, stable sky
conditions for a range of air masses, m, between 2 and 6.5.
Calculations are then carried out using these measured voltages to
determine the calibration factor Vo (i.e. the voltage signal V for an
air mass of zero) for each of the three channels.  The calibration
calculations are performed using the program "vegcal" written by Lutz
Bannehr.

Figure 1 shows the data collected during the SVR calibration performed
on 24 February 1995.  Table 1 gives the results from the calibration
calculations.

Following are the calibration-factor results for each of the three
 channels:
          Vo, 650 nm:  229.46 mV
          Vo, 760 nm:  453.90 mV
          Vo, 862 nm:  614.09 mV

Table 1 also gives the calibration factors that must be multiplied
by the 650 and 862 nm signals.  The values of these two calibration
factors, denoted "C_650" and "C_862," were determined to be 2.5279 and
0.5951, respectively.

[Editor's note:  Figure 1 and Table 1 cannot be reproduced in this text
file, and, therefore, are missing.  See the Project Documentation Summary
notebook instead.]


General Discussion

It should be noted that the voltage values recorded during the 24
February calibration of the SVR are significantly smaller than the
values recorded during the last recorded calibration of the instrument
(17 September 1991).  During the 1991 calibration, recorded voltage
values for the three SVR channels were on the order of one to two
thousand mV, rather than several hundred mV as were recorded during the
most recent calibration.  This significant difference in the magnitude
of the voltage readings is believed to be due to both filter degradation
for each of the channels and contamination (i.e. dirt) on the aperture
glass for each of the channels.  These two problems were left
unaddressed for the calibration of the SVR, however, to obtain
calibration data from the instrument while it was in the same
operational status as during the BOREAS flights.

14.  Data Quality Report by Teresa Campos on the LI-COR CO2 measurements:
     A detailed report on instrument performance and on the flight-by-flight
     data processing procedures.

     The LI-COR Model 6262 CO2 and H2O analyzer measures CO2
absorption of 4.26 æm and H2O absorption of 2.59  æm infrared
radiation.  It is a differential non-dispersive IR instrument.
The optical bench consists of a single source, two absorption
cells, and a lead selenide detector for each analyzable gas.
Ambient air samples are introduced into the sample cell, and
hydrocarbon-free zero air is introduced into the reference cell
to provide a measurement of transmittance in the absence of
analyte absorption.  The broadband source alternately illuminates
the sample and reference cells.  The output voltages, XCO2S and
XLH2OS, are proportional to the difference in optical
transmission between the two channels.

     Correction must be made for cell temperature, pressure and
water content.  These are recorded as variables XCO2T, XCO2P and
XLH2OS.  The temperature sensor is a thermistor affixed to the
gold-plated aluminum flow cell.  Ports for direct measurement of
cell pressure were tapped near the center of the cell.  Pressures
were measured using Rosemount 1201F absolute pressure sensors and
recorded as variables XCO2P (sample cell pressure), and XCO2RP
(reference cell pressure).

     Calibration of the instrument was performed by introduction
of a certified standard gas (about 350 ppmv) or a CO2-free
synthetic air mixture into the sample cell.  When possible the
front panel gain and offset amplifiers were adjusted to enable
front panel display of the corrected CO2 and H2O concentrations.
This was not possible for many BOREAS research flights.  It is
believed that the cause of this problem was cell contamination.
This theory is supported by reports from the LI-COR technical
staff when the unit was returned for post-intensive cleaning and
calibration checks.

     Immediately prior to IFC-1, the unit was returned to LI-COR
for replacement of amplifier filter components to enable a true
10 Hz response for the CO2 channel.  Subsequent spectral analyses
of data gathered during research flights indicate that these
modifications did not bring about the desired result.
Manufacturer specifications indicate an accuracy of 1 ppm, a zero
drift of 1 ppmv/hr and a span drift of 0.12 ppmv/hr.  Many
flights showed drift in excess of specifications.

     LI-COR recommends the use of the following equation for
conversion of raw voltage into CO2 mixing ratios:

     XCO2C =[ (146.02 * x)+(11.167*x2)+(6.7154*x3)+(-0.89997*x4)+
             (0.059722*x5)] * w * (273.15+XCO2T)/309.05                    (1)

where
     x = XCO2S * 1013 / XCO2P / w                                          (2)
and
     w = 1 + 0.5 * XLH2OC / 1000                                           (3).


The expression recommended by LI-COR for converting XLH2OS to
XLH2OC is:

     XLH2OC = [(7.3525*y)+(3.4691*y2)+(0.0028791*y3)] *
               (273.15+XCO2T)/313.85                                       (4)

where
     y = XLH2OS * 1013 / XCO2P                                             (5).

From the results of ground tests, discussed in the immediately
following paragraphs, the CO2 pressure correction was modified to
better reflect the instrument pressure dependence over the broad
range encountered during BOREAS flights.

CO2 Notes:

Flux bias estimates:

     A test of flux bias was conducted during three flights of
the third intensive.  Calibration gas was introduced into the
sample cell for 5 to 20 minutes of a low altitude flux leg.  The
"flux" during this interval was calculated to give an indication
of the systematic bias to be expected from flux measurements
using this instrument.  The results are summarized below:

     Flight              Observed detrended "flux"
       22                -0.010    ppmv-m/s
       24                -0.003
       25                -0.004

     From this limited data set, it can be inferred that the effect
is not strictly reproducible.  It would perhaps be best to state
the bias estimate to be -0.01 ppmv-m/s.


Modifications to pressure corrections, and justification:

     On 22 September, 1994, the intermittent sampler and front
cabin LI-COR instruments were calibrated from the same plumbing
and pressure control configuration.  Both instruments were
connected to the intermittent sampler distribution manifold.  The
front cabin LI-COR was connected to intermittent sampler data
lines, with replacement names indicated as follows:

                                                       Sampling
     Int. Samp. Variable Name      818 Var Name        Frequency
     XISVLA                        XCO2S               25 sps
     XSEAFL                        XCO2P                 1
     XISTHC                        XCO2T                 1
     XISTEO3                       XCO2F                 1
     XISSUPR                       XCO2RP                1

     Span gas was introduced into the sample plenum and
measurements were recorded as the pressure was changed both
continuously and in steps.  The data were then processed using
the LI-COR recommended polynomial equation applied to the raw
signal only (i.e. x = XCO2S in the aforementioned equation; w =1
since synthetic gas mixture was measured).  Since the
temperature, XCO2T, varied only 2øC over the course of these
tests, a reasonable assumption was made that the variations in
output were dependent on the instrument pressure response.  A
power law fit to the ratio of standard pressure (1013 mb) to
ambient yielded the following equations:

     x = XCO2S
     XCO2C =[ (146.02 * x)+(11.167*x2)+(6.7154*x3)+(-0.89997*x4)+
             (0.059722*x5)] * (273.15+XCO2T)/309.05 *
             (1013/XCO2P)1.3                                               (6)

     The equation used for final data processing is a
modification of equation (6) to compensate for calibration and
zero drift over the course of the flight.  These adjustments were
based on pre-, post- and intra-flight calibration and zero
measurements using cylinder gases.  It was assumed that the drift
would have a linear time dependence.  Also, the water correction
for dilution was modified to reflect a LI-COR calculation error
discovered by Ken Davis.  For most flights the water mixing ratio
used was XLH2OC.  However, low rate data for flights 13,17,19-21
used MR for water correction.  All high rate files used XLH2OC.
No treatment was incorporated to compensate for the dependence of
[CO2] on the pressure broadening of the water absorption line.
The final equations are included below, followed by flight
specific values.

     x = XCO2S
     q = XLH2OC/1000
     XCO2C =[ (146.02 * x)+(11.167*x2)+(6.7154*x3)+(-0.89997*x4)+
             (0.059722*x5)] *(273.15+XCO2T)/309.05 *
             (1013/XCO2P)1.3 / (1-q)
     XCO2C = XCO2C * (Cal. factor + cal drift * time) - (Offset -
              off drift * time)                                            (7)

Note:  CO2 instrument found to have a 4-s time constant,
greatly reducing frequency response.  The manufacturers claimed
that we didn't observe a 10 Hz frequency response in IFC-I
because they had incorporated the 0.05-s time constant amplifier
into the back panel output labeled "4-s."  The instrument was,
therefore, modified for IFC-II to select the output from the 4-s
channel.  Spectral analysis of flight data showed that the data
collected from the 4-s channel had an approximately 0.2 Hz
frequency response.  This implied that the amplifier improvements
had not been properly implemented.  Affected research flights are
RF09 and RF10.

H2O Notes:

     The H2O channel was not measuring ambient during the intervals listed
in the previous discussion.

Comparison with MR:

     The trends in XMRLI mirrored those of MR, however, during many flights
an offset was observed to occur between the values of the two sensors.
Typically the water mixing ratio measured by the LI-COR was higher.  The
table below lists the mean offset for each flight.

Recommendations:

     Much has been learned about the behavior and drawbacks of using the
LI-COR CO2/H2O analyzer for aircraft measurements.  However, some issues
remain unresolved.  In spite of modifications to the pressure correction of
ambient data, a residual pressure/altitude effect remains.  This effect is
variable and seems at first glance to be affected by the calibration factor
and drift, as well as by the offset and offset drift.  Additionally, the
effect of changing water mixing ratio on the measured CO2 concentration
needs to be characterized or water removal from sampled air needs to be
effected.

     Apparently, the instrument performed well enough during this project
(818) to produce flux measurements of reasonable quality.  However, the data
should be used with extreme caution for evaluation of mean levels, and for
comparison of measurements as a function of altitude.  Clearly, further
development effort needs to be undertaken before this instrument is
supported for airborne CO2 measurements.

The fast ozone instrument is based upon the reaction of nitrogen oxide (NO)
with ozone (O3).  The reaction produces light principally in the infrared;
a small portion of the light produced can be detected by the red-sensitive
photomultiplier tube (PMT) used as the measuring device by this instrument.
This method is also used in the reverse direction in most instruments
measuring low concentrations of nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere.  The
flow rate of sample gas through the fast ozone instrument is kept high to
be useful in eddy-correlation flux estimates where a response rate of at
least 10 Hz is desired.  The signal level is also relatively large in the
fast ozone instrument;  the PMT voltage can be measured directly, rather
than by photon counting which is usual in nitrogen oxides analyzers.

For the BOREAS project, two fast ozone instruments were operated in
parallel to compare their performance.  The unit whose output was used to
produce the derived variable XO3FC uses dry ice cooling;  the other unit
uses refrigeration.  The refrigerated unit was coupled with a different
reactor for each of the BOREAS intensives:  during the first intensive its
reactor was nearly identical to that used on the dry ice-cooled unit;
during the second, a slightly smaller reactor of the type commonly used for
high-sensitivity nitrogen oxides detection was used;  and during the third
intensive a much smaller reactor which is usually used for "semi-fast"
ozone measurements by RAF was used.  The signals from the refrigerated
system are intended for RAF in-house use only.

Fast ozone data quality was generally good throughout the BOREAS project
with the following exceptions:  during the first four flights of the
project, a bad input card in the aircraft data system (ADS) added noise to
the PMT signals from both fast ozone units (XO3F1S and XO3F2S);  reactor
temperature control was not very good through much of the project, but a
correction for variation in reactor temperature has been added to
compensate for this problem in producing the calibrated ozone data.  The
data from the slower ozone instrument suffered from aerosol effects, which
were unexpectedly large during the BOREAS project, and its calibrated
output (TEO3C) should be used with caution.

The calibrated fast ozone output (XO3FC) was calculated by comparison with
the slow ozone data (TEO3C), with provision made for the effect of aerosols
on the latter.  As mentioned above, an adjustment for reactor temperature
was also made.  The standard algorithm used to produce XO3FC includes a
correction for the effect of humidity upon the amount of light produced by
the reaction, and is

     XO3FC(ppbv) = F1*XO3F1S*(1+3.43*EDPC/PSFDC)

where EDPC is the partial pressure of water (gas phase) and PSFDC is the
total static pressure outside the airplane.  The temperature-correction
factor by which the right side of the standard algorithm was multiplied for
the BOREAS project is

     (1-(XO3FT-F2)*F3).

The constants F1, F2, and F3 were adjusted for each of the intensive
periods as follows:

     Intensive      Flights   F1        F2        F3
     1              1-8       10.0      40.0      0.0184
     2              9-16      11.07     37.0      0.0148
     3              17-24     12.1      37.0      0.0148
     3              25        12.6      37.0      0.0148

16.  Data recording typically begins well in advance of the actual aircraft
     takeoff time.  Virtually all measurements made on the Electra require
     some sort of airspeed correction, or the systems are simply not active
     while the aircraft remains on the ground.  Typically the data
     recording was allowed to continue during stops.  None of the data
     collected while the aircraft is on the ground should be considered
     valid.
