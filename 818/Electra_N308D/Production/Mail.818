Paul,

What's happening with BOREAS?  The last I spoke with you people were
pondering the CO2 measurements.  Have the pos-calibrations been done
yet?  When do you anticipate that we can begin setting up NIMBUS for
the production processing?  Will you need help from Allen or me?

I have a request, and I'm not sure of the best way to carry it out.  I'd
like to have the files put into the $PROD_DATA directory with a specific
naming convention.  That way, I can run a script I wrote to produce a "tape"
log which will make a file that lists flight number, date, start and end
times, etc. for all the files.  I think the easiest way to do that would be
for you to add world write permission to those files.  Then I should be able
to move them to the $PROD_DATA directory and run my script.  I would make
`nimbus' the owner and restore write permissions.  That way, it will reflect
the true production status of those files.

Would that be OK with you?

In the future, I also request that, any time you are running a "production"
job, that you run `nimbus' or your skeleton program when logged in as
`nimbus,' and put the output files in the `/home/local/data/production'
directory.  That way, they are better protected, and if non-standard file
names are chosen, I can rename them easily, so my scripts will work.

Thanks.

I added global write permission to the skel-modified netCDF files, for your
convenience.  Your plan sounds fine to me.

I will run all future files with the nimbus login, as you recommend.

Teresa and Paul,

Teresa mentioned to me today that she is preparing to do high-rate
production processing for BOREAS.  In anticipation of that I reviewed a
low-rate netCDF file header and found minor problems with the low-rate
processing.
  1)  Two of the LRT output variables have no definitions:  DVALU and
       XO3FDG.  For the high-rate processing, these should be fixed
       (by adding them to the `VarDB' file or eliminating them from
       output). 
  2) Some of the special variables (XISCO2T, XISSP1, XISSP2, XISSUPR
       and XISTHC) have units of "V" instead of "Vdc."  These are not
       worth changing.

Changes needed for high-rate processing:
  1)  You need to choose the output rate for the following variables:
       CNTS, CONCN, COCAL, COCOR, COZRO, XCO2C, XLH2OC, XMRLI, XO3FDG,
       VEWC and VNSC.
  2)  The proper output rate for VEW and VNS is 10 sps.  Both need to
       be set manually since they default to 1 sps.

When I prepared for high-rate processing of 4-870 WISP-94, I created a
special setup file which I called `HRT.convert.'  (The file is in the
`.../proj/870/Production' directory in case you want to look at it.)  It
contained the unique changes necessary for high-rate processing (including
setting NIMBUS to "high-rate").  I manually loaded it before each production
run.  Because of the `FlightGroups' file and the individual `Flight_xx'
setup files from the low-rate processing, all the other unique changes were
brought in automatically without having to do anything else.  (This, of
course, assumes that all the setup files are correct.)  If you would like
to do something similar, I can help you set it up.

Teresa, before you do any production high-rate processing, please see me
for some additional pointers.  Thanks.

Ron,

I have generated 4 HRT .cdf files.  They range from 250-300 M.  

I have talked with John Lind regarding project 201 .cdf and .asc files.  He has 
one more processing task which he must perform before we can delete the .cdf 
files.  He has promised to finish everything by the end of work today, and will 
then delete all the 201 files.  I have plenty to do in the meantime with the
files already in /home/data, so I don't foresee any problems with this plan.  
What do you think?

As per our recent conversation, I will not archive these files yet, since
you have found space to put them in /home//staticdata.  Please let me know

Teresa and Paul,

I have archived the NIMBUS production netCDF files from 4-818 BOREAS
that Teresa specified via email yesterday.  I have archived both the
original NIMBUS-produced files and the production output files after
output from Teresa's skeleton program was merged into the original
data.

The Mass Store System bitfiles have the following names:

Original, unmodified data (from directory `mistral:/home/productiondata'):
/RAF/1994/818/ORIG/LRT/RF13.cdf
/RAF/1994/818/ORIG/LRT/RF14.cdf
/RAF/1994/818/ORIG/LRT/RF15.cdf
/RAF/1994/818/ORIG/LRT/RF16.cdf
/RAF/1994/818/ORIG/LRT/RF17.cdf
/RAF/1994/818/ORIG/LRT/RF18.cdf

/RAF/1994/818/ORIG/HRT/RF17.cdf

Final "skeletonized" data (from directory `chinook:/home/tmp/campos'):
/RAF/1994/818/LRT/RF13.cdf
/RAF/1994/818/LRT/RF14.cdf
/RAF/1994/818/LRT/RF15.cdf
/RAF/1994/818/LRT/RF16.cdf
/RAF/1994/818/LRT/RF17.cdf
/RAF/1994/818/LRT/RF18.cdf

/RAF/1994/818/HRT/RF17.cdf

Since these have now been archived, I suspect it is OK to remove their disk
file copies here at Jeffco.  I archived these data from the directories
`/home/productiondata' (original) and `/home/tmp/campos' (skeleton).

Some previous data have already been archived to the MSS.  I suspect, with
your current processing, that you will want me to overwrite these.  Please
let me know.  I have already overwritten two of these.

Already overwritten:
/RAF/1994/818/LRT/RF17.cdf
/RAF/1994/818/LRT/RF18.cdf

To be overwritten:
/RAF/1994/818/LRT/RF19.cdf

Ron,

Thanks for your email confirming archiving of BOREAS data files.  I'm glad we
can remove the Jeffco copies, because of serious memory limitations in the

As you suspected, the files we wrote to the mass store a while back should be
overwritten.  Below are listed some more file ready for archiving.

Ron,

Some more files are ready for archiving.  I have used up available space on /home/
tmp, so two of the files are in /home/data.

LRT	/home/tmp/campos/818RF12b.cdf
	/home/tmp/campos/818RF09b.cdf
	/home/tmp/campos/818RF08b.cdf
	/home/data/818RF11b.cdf

HRT	/home/tmp/campos/818RF13Hb.cdf
	/home/tmp/campos/818RF12Hb.cdf
	/home/data/818RF08Hb.cdf

Thanks,

Teresa

Teresa and Paul,

I have begun the archive process for the following files (and the original
NIMBUS parent files prior to your skeleton processing).  These files should
be archived over the next few hours, barring any undue problems with file
transfers over the network.  As of now, about 60% of the files have already
been transferred.  (The larger HRT files will take the longest, because they
are large and get put at the bottom of the queue.)  I'll let you know when
they have completed.

Ron, 

The following files are ready for archiving.  You will notice that the LRT and HRT
files for RF08 are being overwritten.  I discovered a math error in my skel 
program and re-processed both .cdf files.  Bon appetit!

Teresa and Paul,

I assume that you, Teresa, ran only your skeleton program for RF08, not
the original NIMBUS processing, too, and therefore, only the final output
files need to be rearchived.  Please let me know if this is NOT the case.

I also assume that you reprocessed the LRT data for RF11, since you are
includinga it in the list above and the file is dated Mar 30 21:24.
(I had already archived it yesterday).

Just for your information, in addition to the files mentioned above, the
following MSS bitfiles will be overwritten by this request:

/RAF/1994/818/LRT/RF22.cdf  (archived 28 February 1995)
/RAF/1994/818/LRT/RF23.cdf  (archived 28 February 1995)
/RAF/1994/818/LRT/RF24.cdf  (archived 28 February 1995)
/RAF/1994/818/LRT/RF25.cdf  (archived 28 February 1995)

I have included these in my latest series of MIGS archive jobs which I
submitted about 3:00 p.m. today.  As before, I'll let you know when
these jobs have completed.

The only file which is ready for archiving is listed below.  I am in the
process of moving it to /home/tmp/campos and things are proceeding slowly, so it 
might be awhile before it arrives there.

Teresa and Paul,

Just thought I'd give you a summary of the production data files that
are present on the Mass Store.  This should tell you what is left to
be done.  The dates in the first column are the date of last access.
(For us that is probably the creation date.)  All the following bitfiles
are in the MSS directory:  /RAF/1994/818/

The bitfiles in the HRT and LRT directories are merged files from Teresa's
 skeleton:
03/31/95 -W-S 293381092 HRT/RF07.cdf

Ron,

Greetings.  Two more files to be archived reside in /home/data.  I have only two
more flights to skeletonize, then hopefully BOREAS can be laid to rest.  

HRT	/home/data/818RF02Hb.cdf
	/home/data/818RF04Hb.cdf

Thanks,

Teresa and Paul,

The following files have been successfully archived to the MSS:
   $PROD_DATA/818RF02H.cdf --> /RAF/1994/818/ORIG/HRT/RF02
   $PROD_DATA/818RF04H.cdf --> /RAF/1994/818/ORIG/HRT/RF04

   $DATA_DIR/818RF04Hb.cdf --> /RAF/1994/818/HRT/RF04

The following raw ADS data files are still present in the following
MIGS directories:

../campos:
818rf25.ADS

../chris:
818rf08.ADS

../paul:
818rf01.ADS   818rf03.ADS   818rf05.ADS
818rf02.ADS   818rf04.ADS   818rf06.ADS

I'm pretty sure Chris was using RF08 as a test case, so it should remain.
I remember archiving the processed from most of the other files, so if
they are no longer needed ...

Thanks.

Teresa and Paul,

I have just looked at the MSS directory listing following completion of
the archive jobs, and I found a file-size discrepancy

   $DATA_DIR/818RF02Hb.cdf --> /RAF/1994/818/HRT/RF02
                 274528116     274528192

To avoid a potential problem, I will rearchive this file, so please
don't remove it from the system.  I'll let you know when it transferred
successfully.

Thanks.

Teresa and Paul,

I have just looked at the MSS directory listing following completion of
rearchiving the following file, and their sizes now agree.

   $DATA_DIR/818RF02Hb.cdf --> /RAF/1994/818/HRT/RF02
                 274528116     274528116

So, I think I am finished with all of the 818 archiving as of now.

Ron,

Thanks for noticing the problem with HRT RF02.  I noticed a problem after sending
you the archive request.  The original file hadn't yet been merged with the
skeleton output.  I tried to make the necessary changes before it was actually
archived, and obviously I didn't make it.

The final BOREAS files are finally ready to be archived.  I think also there is
a LRT file that hasn't been included in an archive request.  If I'm in error,
please disregard that part of this request.  Also, if any flights seem to be 
missing from the archive, please let me know.

LRT	/home/data/818RF02b.cdf
		  /818RF05b.cdf
		  /818RF06b.cdf

HRT	/home/data/818RF05Hb.cdf

Hi Ron:thanks for your archiving efforts and keeping a sharp eye on all
the bits and pieces.When you have a chance could you organize this 
information in a log form for both LRT and HRT processed flights.
Many thanks.

Teresa and Paul,

   $DATA_DIR/818RF06Hb.cdf --> /RAF/1994/818/HRT/RF06

I just looked at the MSS directory, and these are the only files
that have not yet been archived to the MSS.  Once these complete
you will have archived the entire data set.

To Paul:  I have a complete MSS bitfile log for the LRT data.  I will
          have to retrieve some data sets from the MSS to complete one
          for the HRT data.  (The start and end times will be different
          for those data.)  I thought I was getting this information
          often enough, but a few flights slipped throgh the cracks.
          FYI, I'm missing HRT info for RF07, RF09, RF11-RF18, RF20-RF22
          and RF24.

Paul,

   I know you want to include in your QC report some information about
the strange operation of the NIMBUS GPS-correction software.  Below is
the explanation that Chris Webster gave me.  It is important to note that
only the high-rate processing is affected.  The result is that I would not
recommend that any of the GPS-corrected data (LATC, LONC, VEWC, VNSC, UIC,
VIC, WIC, UXC, VYC, WDC and WSC) be used for critical research.
   I don't know whether I can simplify what he said below, but the gist of
it is that he was making too many correction passes through the data.  It
may mean that the "corrected" values follow the GPS too closely.  As we
discovered, it can also create short (~ 1-minute) excursions away from the
other two measurements that are obviously incorrect.
   If you want further information, perhaps you and I should get together
with Chris for a talk.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The directly-affected variables were LATC, LONC, VEWC, & VNSC, then whatever
derived variables they fed into.

The problem was that the variables are not generated each pass into the amlib;
rather, they are iteratively refined.  I was not storing the low-rate pass data
separately from the high-rate pass data; therefore, the high-rate pass was
drastically affecting the low-rate pass.  I would also hazard a guess that
the low-rate pass was nominally affecting the high-rate pass.  In other words,
there were 26 iterative refinments per second to one variable when there
should have been 1 for the low-rate data, and 25 for the high-rate data.

Teresa,

Looks OK to me.

I strongly urge you to write your `nimbus' production output files to the
`/home/productiondata' directory.  I also recommend that you move the
files you have already created to that directory.   Ultimately, I don't
want anyone writing production data to /home/data unless the
`/home/productiondata' directory is full.  Right now, the
`/home/productiondata' directory is only about 50% full (2Gbytes
available).

I have a request in to Chris for the next NIMBUS release that would preset
the file paths for input and output in the initial NIMBUS window.  For
production files, it would have already suggested a file name based upon
the input ADS file header and the login name.  That would save a lot of
confusion on the part of those running NIMBUS.  I have not yet figured out
NIMBUS would treat high-rate processing, since that choice comes after
selecting an output file name.  If the user has absolutely no choice in
the matter, the file name could be chosen by NIMBUS after one clicks the
GO button.  I have to talk with Chris about this.

Chris,

I have a few plots showing "glitches" in LATC and LONC when it appears that
no corresponding changes occur with either GLAT, LAT, GLON or LON.  I'm
wondering if there might be something strange going on with the NIMBUS code.
I put example plots in your mailbox which include comparisons to the low-
rate processing.  (The low-rate "corrected" GPS latitudes and longitudes
look considerably different from the high-rate versions, too.)

Ron,

The files you listed which are in the nimbus home directory are not mine.  It 
looks like they may well belong to greg, or were generated by his skel program.

The amlib* files in the 818 directory do indeed need to be archived.  I also have
the files produced by the skeleton program, which are stored in /home/tmp/campos.
Please let me know how I can save them to the mass store (and suggestions about
where they should reside).  Thanks for all your help,

Teresa

There are a number of files in the `nimbus' home directory that I'd like
to move.  Can you tell me if any are yours, and, if so, what is their
purpose?  I assume that the 818 subdirectory has your skeleton processor
(which I should archive).

Teresa,

Thanks for the prompt reply.  Greg owned up to the files and has already
moved them.  How's that for efficiency?

I hope you are `touch'ing those files in /home/tmp!  Otherwise, they could
disappear at any time, and they are NOT backed up.

Normally I take responsibility for doing the archiving.  Since all this
information is related to the Boreas project, I think it best to create a
subdirectory off the home/local/proj/818 directory and stashing stuff there.
The ~nimbus/818 directory can be moved to the 818 directory and renamed to
something like "CO2skel."  (I assume the skeleton improved the CO2 data.)
The skeleton output data is another matter.  It's too large to put in the
project's directory, so I should move them directly to the MSS.  I need to
come up with a subdirectory name for them.  Since I have saved the original
output files to the MSS as well as the ones modified by the skeleton output,
are you sure that you want me to save these data, too?

Ron,

Since we are saving the original data files and the code used to produce the 
skeletonized data files, it sounds like we don't have to save the data files
produced thereby.  If (perish the thought) we are required to re-run any of the
BOREAS files, it would not take an inordinate amount of time to re-skel the 
new data files.  So, it's ok by me to let them be removed.

Sorry about the confusion.

Paul,

Steve called me a short time ago, and we discussed the NIMBUS processing.
I looked at the BOREAS output files that we still have here, and the NIMBUS
header for both those flights show the sample rate for VLA was 50 sps for
RF01 and RF02, not 5 sps.  Apparently VLA was only put through a 1Hz filter
prior to sampling.  Therefore, the QC report is wrong when discussing
anomalies for RF01 and RF02.  I have already pencilled in the correct
sample-rate information in our local Project Summary binder.  I'm not sure
whether this is something that needs further dissemination.

Steve,

At your request, I am assembling the electronic (mostly WordPerfect)
documentation for the BOREAS project.  Once I collect everything together,
where would you like me to put it?  I can send you 3.5" PC disks or put it
in a directory you can access.  (Other suggestions welcome, too.)

I put the pertinent files on "stout" in the directory:  "/dt/ron/boreas"
All the files except "taplog.818" (the Mass Store Bitfile Log) are in
WordPerfect 6.1 format.  taplog.818 is a UNIX ASCII file.

These files should be the text portion of all the sections of the BOREAS
Project Summary binder.  If anything is missing, please let me know, and
I'll try to get it for you.  (We have misplaced our own copy of the BOREAS
Project Summary binder, so I cannot verify it myself.)

Steve,

The `stout' disk partition in which I put all the Boreas documentation for you
is subject to scrubbing.  So if you find the files in `/dt/ron/boreas' missing,
you may grab them from the stout directory `~ron/boreas.'  I put a copy of all
the files there.  (I'll be on vacation from 14-23 August 1996.)

Ron,

I've checked through the documentation files and they look good.
The only gaps I saw were:
- RAF Bulletins
- NCAR Tech. Notes
- The actual slides (obviously!)
- Output Tape Format (from ncdump -h)
- Figure 1 and Table 1 from Krista's Section 13 of the Data Quality Report
Of these, I was only surprised by the last, but it certainly isn't
serious.

Thanks a lot for making these available...Steve

Barb,

Here is the latest information from the Boreas project.  I thought you
may be able to use the information below instead of having to retype
all the numbers, since I've already done it.

I've put the information in two forms:  one the way it appears on the Data
Tape Log that Krista gave me and one the way I want it.  (I didn't add
Krista's remsrks, however.)

Rob says that NCAR graphics is installed on zappa already (as I had thought
before).  Chris also was unsure if he took the groundsystem maintenance
manual.  This manual hasn't been updated for Solaris yet, because of staff
limitations.  I would grab your notes from the sysadmin class you took and use
the "whatnow" command on zappa to determine SunOS<>Solaris differences.

Ron,

  My memory is hazy on what led me to think NCAR graphics was
not present on zappa.  I'm fairly sure that I did such things
as "which ctrans" and found none, at least using the normal
path settings for a "user" login.  If it's there, maybe the
problem is environment variables.  I do remember looking where
I thought it should be, and not finding it.

  Might be good to carry along a copy for installation, just
in case.

The code is on mistral in /home/local/src/ncarg_3.2  I will not be able to help
with this since I have a crucial deadline to get our system maintenance
contracts updated before I leave on vacation next week.  There should be
documentation in the directory structure under ncarg_3.2/man

Subject: Release of BOREAS Data
Cc: paul, ron, krista
Status: RO

Dear Don, Jakob, and Steve:

After conversations with Paul Spyers-Duran and Ron Ruth out
here at RAF, I wanted to email you further information regarding
the RAF policy for distribution of data.  As has been pointed
out by Ron, it is not our policy to archive data on the Mass
Store until it has gone through our final quality analysis here
at Jeffco and we have certified and processed it for release.
Only then do we place it on the Mass Store for general use of
the public.

As Ron pointed out, we do not wholly approve of preliminary
data having been placed on the Mass Store.  We therefore ask
that you place a read password on the data you have already
placed there, and further that you notify either Ron, Paul, or
myself before you give out the password to anyone else.  By
way of explanation for our decisions--and so you do not think
our policy to be at all arbitrary--I would like to explain
why this policy has been implemented at RAF.  In the past,
we have released preliminary (what we often call "quick look")
data to the public after having stressed that it is only
preliminary and should not be used for publication.  Despite
our emphasizing that the data are preliminary, we have had
people come back to us later and complain that the data does
not look right and were not processed correctly.  Despite
having been "on the record" as having classified the data
as quick look, numerous people here have had to spend a
considerable amount of time doing damage control to explain
what was found in the data.  It is for this reason that RAF
is now trying to exert greater control over to whom the 
preliminary data are released.  We are not trying to prevent
you from using the data; rather, we are simply trying to
make sure that the general public is given only the best
quality data.

Having outlined our reasons, we would like to make the following
requests:

1) If you decide to release some of the data to researchers at
OSU, we ask that you restrict the release of data to a very
small number of people, perhaps only one person.  We also ask
that you make very clear to whomever wants the data that it
is preliminary *only*, and as such *is not to be widely distributed
or used for publication*.

2) We also must assert that, in future, all requests for preliminary
data should be made to either Ron Ruth, Paul Spyers-Duran, or
myself out here at RAF.  In this manner, we will be able to keep
track of who all has received preliminary data and can make
sure that they receive copies of the final data when we have
finished processing it.

As I stated above, we are not trying to be overly hardline or
exert undue control over use of the data.  We simply want to make
sure that users do not become confused by too many data sets
floating around on the Mass Store and that users are provided
with the best possible data for the project.

Please contact any one of us out here at Jeffco should you have
any further questions.

Krista

A couple hundred floats is not going to equal several hundred kilo-bytes.
The new version is from the development and has debugging information compiled
into it.

You are running version 1.6 + current developments in 1.7.  Which includes
PSFD support for the DSM's, a re-arrangement in the way SDI variables are
handled internally, and a fix for the disk full problem.

We've got a better idea...Rob is installing the disk here, hopefully 
with everything you'll need including the "finish" portion of onboard
install. Then we'll mail the disk and all you need do is install it
physically into galileo's box. This is still all assuming that the 
disk is actually the problem. If that doesn't get it, Larry says
to simply contact a Sun rep (chris webster knows where one is in
Canada, I think) and pay him, it comes out of the deployment fund
which makes Larry happier than losing me out here for the 2-3 days it
would take. Given my schedule with Buckley shuttling, test flights,
etc., and the inefficiency of working via phone/email with you in
a process that likely would not be without its glitches, I'd say this
approach is the best one at the moment.

Robb should have this completed by sometime Thursday morning, to be shipped
out by the p.m. to you guys.

Slight change in plans.  We're going to send out an entire CPU to you rather
than just the hard drive.  This means that we need to have the old galileo
shipped back here ASAP.  The new machine will be installed as galilieo and
you should be able to just plug it right in.

If you have an questions/concerns please let me know.  I'll be reading my
email all day, although I won't be in the office past 11:00 MST.

Hi Ron;I am sending you this message,since I know you will check it.
This morning I put in for 8 hrs "Holiday Worked" for all the RAF Exempt Employees.These are Barber,Boynton,Campos,Ruth,Schanot,Taylor,Tejcek.
For Kurt,Bob,and Bill need to be indicated on the weekly time sheet.
(May I suggest to you,not to advertise this with non-RAF folks,since there
maybe different interpretation by some others since we didn't fly etc.)
I don't know whether I mentioned to you,that I wrote the weekly report
last Sunday.Since no copier was available I didn't leave a copy in Sask.,
I hope all is well at Saskatoon.I am leaving for a conference I'll be back
in the office Thursday p.m.Feel free to send me messages.Regards.Best wishes
to the gang.Paul

Teresa asked me to write you in her absence.  She's flying right now.

She apologizes for not writing sooner and plans to update you on
instrument performance after today's flight (RF-23).  (Please be
patient, as there is always a run on this email lap-top after each
flight, especially now with the ASR due.)

Teresa also wanted me to inform you that the equipment from Brazil

Paul,

If things go as planned, our last research flight will be tomorrow.  We
will then either pack up the ops center during that flight or the day
after.  That means we will be returning Thursday or Friday.  (RF-24 is
presently going on, and time remains for one more flight which is planned
for tommorow.  In jest, I think, Don mentioned doing an additional 1-hour
jaunt to finish up his alloted hours.)

Allen wanted me to write you about the potential transportation problem
at Buckley when we return.  He asked that the van you are presently using
as the C-130 shuttle be kept for our arrival.  Since it probably won't hold
all the people coming back on the Electra, I was planning to have Judy (my
wife) bring our van.  Potentially we could take four more people with modest
luggage or three more with a lot of luggage.

Please let us know your plans so we can make ours.

Thanks.

HI Ron;
Good thinking and planning ahead!The C-130 is planning to depart to Seattle,
on Thursday around 1 p.m.We will have the vehicles out at Buckley.It is a 
good idea to have Judy come out,since the pickup truck will have to bring
back some or most of the luggage,if it is rainy we can put some of it in your
Van.
Let me know about the plans as they unfold.I will let you know from this end also.Regards Paul...
P.S.(Assuming that C-130 leaves around 1 p.m. it would be good if you guys
can come in shortly after that.)
You might want to suggest to the Germans to make an advanced reservation for 
the car.Andi had problems before w/o reservations.
Ask them also,whether Barb needs to make room res.,or they will take care of it.
Plse let me know.Regards Paul

Paul,

Hans and Kris would both like room reservations when we return, and they
are planning to make their own car reservations here.

The decision about whether to fly tomorrow (last flight) will be made
early tomorrow morning.  If not tomorrow, it is likely we will fly
Thrusday.  We'll keep you posted on progress, so you know when we will
be coming in.

Thanks for your note.There are istrumentation problems w/ C-130,it is unlikely
that it will leave on Thursday(tomorrow).This might complicate the pick-up
for you guys at Buckley,as far as the GSA van/pickup is concerned.
If needed,can Don arrange for his people for a pick-up?
Ron,can you give me a headcount how many returning on EL?
Barbara is out with sick child,it might be the best if the Germans make their
own reservations,(I can do it,if needed).
Last time they stayed at LaQuinta(303) 425 9099 in Westminster,this will
only take a long distance phonecall,and they can give their own creditcard
rather than using mine.

Paul,

Today is a no-fly day, so we will be delayed, too.  It looks like 13 of us
will be returning on the Electra.

>From RAF:
Jerry, Henry, Harold, Bob, Allen, Ron, Teresa, Bill and Kurt.

>From MMM:
Don, Ken, Hans and Kris.

Regarding Buckley, if we come at a weird time (i.e., when no one is down
there), would a GSA vehicle be there for us to use, or would someone have
to contact RAF for a pickup?

I will query Don about MMM pickup arrangements and let you know his reply.

Ron;Although it is not official yet,Bruce M.told me that most likely that
they will leave on Saturday.That would be ideal,since they can leave 3 vehicles
for you guys,if you would arrive on the same date.C-130 will have 13 people
also.(We are not superstitious!).
The keys to the vehicles can be left at base ops. at Buckley in an envelope.
How does this sounds?
Paul

gents,

I've done some things that you'all should know. LD_LIBRARY_PATH was
recently cleaned up, as per a previous memo. One thing done was to
remove ucb libraries path from it so WINDS would run correctly. A
side effect of this is that without it, xautolock won't run. I've 
installed a workaround in my own .openwin-init file as follows:

#
# screen saver - temporary need for ucb library
#
SAVELIB=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/ucblib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
toolwait xautolock -time 10 -locker "xlock -mode flame -nice 6 -nolock"
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SAVELIB
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH


I've also changed the password for operator to "exadump", since I didn't
know what it had been changed to since the last time it *was* exadump.
BTW, the operator account has exceeded its quota...I didn't know what
to remove, so I didn't do anything. But tape labels on the solaris_netback
are not getting written since operator can't create anything new.

I've used the $LOCAL/scripts/solaris_netback utility and made some more
improvements to it, seems to work OK backing up scraff via mistral. Haven't
tested multiple hosts yet. One thing missing is the ability to fsck
some disks, since they are mounted and operator doesn't have permission to
umount them. fsck simply refuses to check disks that *can* be umounted,
ostensibly by root. 

Marley is coming off the net soon, either disks today or early tomorrow.
I want to run a LAN test with the Suns going to BASE, then back up marley
and finally pack it up. Packing should start, then, late morning or early
afternoon. Any help is appreciated!

Paul,

Bruce is our contact regarding where the vehicle keys will be put,
assuming we arrive after the C-130 departs.  So, I guess you are
out of the loop.

Tomorrow is a research flight day.  We plan to do some packing while
the flight is going on and complete it after the plane returns.

Barb,

I have received your message and will pass the hotel information on
to Hans and Kris.

There will be thirteen (13) of us coming back plus luggage.

I had mentionted to Paul that my wife, Judy, would be willing to come
down to Buckley with our van to help pick up people.  (We could probably
take 3 others + luggage with us.)  But after talking with Allen, he said
that if one hasn't been to Buckley before, it isn't a good idea to go
down there.  However, if you people have to make a special trip to pick
us up, I'm sure Judy would be willing to come to Jeffco and follow someone
down there, if needed.  If Julie or Bruce would like to enlist her aid,
I would ask that someone give her a call today to make the arrangements
(469-0841).

The spare NC6600 memory card must be on the airplane, because Kurt could
not find it amongst the grey boxes in the hangar.  We will isolate it
after the flight today and hand-carry it back to Jeffco tomorrow afternoon.

We have just about everything packed up.  The box of office supplies and
manuals is here along with this laptop PC.  Ken Davis has all his stuff
to pack, but it should not take too long once he returns from today's
flight.

Thanks for all the help from your end.

to drive out the Van.(he wants to get off the fast-O3 reactor from EL.)
Bruce is flying now w/130.,we do not know tomorrows schedule yet whether
further work is required on the C-130.
Greg would like if someone will call him tomorrow morning at his office
at ext 1070.He might be out in hangar,so leave a message on his phone about
your ETA.
Please tell DLR folks,that Barbara spent hrs.,of time to be able locate
room for them in the Bldr/Brommfield/Westminster/Stapelton area.I don't 
want them to think that we didn't put in an effort to find resonable rates.
This arrangment was the only one with reasonable rates.
Good luck!
Please acknowledge reading of this message.Thanks.Paul
P.S.I'll be out of town this weekend,otherwise I would be part of the 
welcoming committee.
Allen should check w/Bruce later today about schedule/GSA car availability,

Ron,

Well, I hope you either check this or get your messages from the hotel.

Anyway,  No problem getting picked up.


It will work best if you cal me before you leave so I have an idea of 
when to get to RAF. 


Greg Kok and I will be coming.  I have left a message for your wife to 
call me to see if she would like to come along also.  If not,  I think 
Greg and I can do it.


My home number is 303-428-6057.  If your wife wants to meet us here at 
RAF to go to Buckley, I will call her in the morning after I hear from 
you.  I will also let Greg know.  

I somewhat expect a call from you (or someone) between 8:30 and 9:30 a.m.

See you then.

barbara

Paul,

I got your message from about 12:30 p.m. today.  There is also a message
from Barb regarding tomorrow's transportation arrangements.  She wrote
that she and Greg will come down to pick us up with the possibility of
my wife, Judy, coming along, too.

I guess we'll call Barb from Aerocentre if a phone is available, else the
hotel.  Our ETD is 9:00 a.m. MDT.  I expect an arrival at Buckley about
1:00 p.m. unless we get unduly delayed going through Customs at Great
Falls, Montana.

I'm replying to this message even though I just talked to you.  As a
verification, we will call you either from the hotel probably before
8:00 a.m. or from Aerocentre just before we leave, probably before 9:00 a.m.

Thanks again for your help in all this, especially your travails at getting
the Germans a place to stay.

See you soon!

     We can either do this by email or in person, but I would like you to
give me your thoughts on RAF maintenance of Mosaic and any thoughts for 
the future on the BOREAS project. Sort of a mini-critique. As far as BOREAS
anything that might improve service to users, better procedures, shortcommings,
and, of course, what we are doing right.

Barb,

Following this message is a summary with as much information as I have
regarding the Boreas project ADS data tapes.  I thought perhaps it would
save you some typing, since I have dates and start & end times for all
of the research flights and some of the tests and ferries.

Hope you and Jackie are feeling much better soon!

Could we get a copy of both the low- and high-rate files to play with?

Steve,

I did run RF25 through NIMBUS at low rate using only the ADS header
information and the local BOREAS Defaults file (without the pitch bias
change or the new Lyman-Alpha hygrometer coefficients).  I just wanted
to get accurate start and end times.  The netCDF header does NOT have
the disclaimer, so please be careful with it.

Zappa is still in its large box on the Electra, and I don't know when
it is due to arrive at Jeffco.  Therefore, all the changes we made to
zappa's BOREAS NIMBUS files are also stashed away.  I'll contact Al
Schanot to see if he has the new Lyman-Alpha coefficients here somewhere.
The low-rate file here on chinook or mistral is:
   /home/local/data/818rf25.cdf
If there is writeable space somewhere on an FL-1 machine (e.g., stout),
I could do a quick `rcp' for you.

If these deficiencies are not important to you, I can also run the
high-rate data for you.

Please let me know what you want me to do.

When did you make it back to Boulder?  Did you get any sleep on the way
(besides at the wheel)?

Steve,

Al hasn't found the Lyman-Alpha coefficients yet.  He said he had some
notes at home that, he hoped, would have those numbers.

Therefore, I'll run the data through low-rate nimbus again with only the
pitch bias changed.

Steve,

This morning I got the proper Lyman-Alpha coefficients from Al Schanot.
I also had to add some variables to the NIMBUS data base so you get proper
names and units in the netCDF header.  There are still quite a few
discriptions missing (like all the fluxes and some of the air chemistry
variables).  We'll straighten that out before final processing.

I am presently transferring the low-rate file for RF25 (81825.cdf) to your
`/sssf4/oncley/boreas' directory on stout.  I'm not sure how long it will
take to transfer the file, but the low-rate data are taking quite a bit
longer than I thought it would.  I am presently running NIMBUS on the
high-rate data.  If that succeeds, I will transfer the file tomorrow
morning; it should be ready by then.

Ah!  The low-rate transfer just finished!  It took less than 15 minutes.
It may take a good part of the morning to transfer the high-rate file.

If the timing works out, you might want to copy the high-rate data
to tape and "black-bag" it to here, to save the network some anguish.
...Steve

P.S. Could you inquire about 2 tickets to Saturday's Verdi performance
for me?

Steve,

You may be correct, except that Jeffco doesn't have "black bag" service.
About the best I can do is to put it in the noon mail.  Normally they
deliver that to FL-1 about 2:30 p.m. if they get a chance to sort it
beforehand.  The other option is for someone to hand-carry it.

Personally, I'm not worried about loading down the network a little,
so I've started a transfer already.  The file will be called 81825hr.cdf
and is 394387452 bytes long.


I'm certain that the Verdi tickets are selling well, so I don't expect
to be able to get the $1 comps.  (Also I won't know that until next
Tuesday or Wednesday.)  If I buy the tickets for you, I can get a 15%
discount off the regular prices of:  $8 to $33.  The better seats will
cost more than $20 each except for the rings (which I like, but which
others may not, because they are so high and isolated).  Personally,
I like Mezannine 4,5,6&7 better than Orchestra; they are higher,
albeit a bit farther away.

After inquiring, tickets are available in all sections of the hall for
Saturday's performance.  Please let me know what you want me to do.
