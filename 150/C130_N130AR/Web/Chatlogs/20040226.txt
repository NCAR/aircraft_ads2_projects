Feb 26 09:10:09 <darrel-c130>	Al, I've been chatting with Daniels and he is giving a presentation at 9:30 for the RICO meeting. He will probably ask differrent folks to check in but already has scheduled me to say hello from c130. Will check on ADS.
Feb 26 09:10:23 <darrel-c130>	Looks fine on this terminal
Feb 26 09:10:58 <schanot>	probably at SATCOM glitch.  won't be very interesting for Michael
Feb 26 09:11:04 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Al it looks like it was a quick drop.  I noticed that Darrel did a time out just s few minutes agao.  Could have been ac tracker also.

Feb 26 10:12:01 <djama-c130>	Thanks Al, we have so far been able to follow the jet core
Feb 26 10:13:23 <schanot>	no help from this end.  looks like a solid case, but your flight plan is changed from the normal.  no map of the jet core this time?
Feb 26 10:13:57 <schanot>	normally you tansect out and work your way back in
Feb 26 10:14:17 <schanot>	when are you going to drop the sondes?

Feb 26 10:19:08 <schanot>	This is Michael Rosengaus, talking through allen schanot slot. How high are the waves? 
Feb 26 10:20:38 <djama-c130>	basically doing 4 x-wind legs at 100' at each "station" starting from close to shore all the way outbound when we dtermine that the wind/wave action has subsided. At that point we will climb to 4000' and head inbound while dropping 10-12 sondes.

Feb 26 11:32:31 <schanot>	Lowell- I just sent you the crew manifest for the return ferrry.  it has the information you require.
Feb 26 11:33:28 <schanot>	Janet- I sent you something on the RICO requirements for computer space.  advise when ready
Feb 26 11:33:59 <anstett>	i'm looking at it.
Feb 26 11:34:23 <schanot>	Larry- we have pulled the plug on the Satelite link.  the "pros" did no better than you did

Feb 26 11:47:49 <anstett>	So you have a png file on the laptop on the airplane that you want to get on a system on the ground?
Feb 26 11:49:38 <darrel-c130>	Hi Janet, we did a print screen then saved it as an image in png format. It seems to have been saved inthe /ads directory. This a winds screen on the front right laptop.
Feb 26 11:51:15 <darrel-c130>	I think the machine is calledblanc. I'd like get the filesince it really is a nice example of how to use winds.
Feb 26 11:53:53 <anstett>	ftp to hercules as ads user; cd to /jnet/r1; you should see .ads files for today flight named 150rf??a.ads where ?? is the number of the research flight; put your png image here; cd to /jnet/r2; put your image here also; that way your image will be on both removables and then have allen get the file off of the removable for you after the flight.
Feb 26 11:58:55 <darrel-c130>	Thanks. I'll give it a try.

Feb 26 12:17:28 <darrel-c130>	Got it
Feb 26 12:22:46 <darrel-c130>	We have a memory lapse at the moment, but Al will be here at the end of flight and can probably help us.
Feb 26 12:26:25 <anstett>	The password for ads is the new password, similar to the old password, but different color and tree.
Feb 26 12:27:55 <anstett>	The directory on hercules to put the image in could just be /r1 instead of /jnet/r1.  If you see the data file from today's flight, then you know that you are in the correct directory.
Feb 26 12:28:56 <stith>	Looks like you guys are having a good flight
Feb 26 12:29:25 <stith>	The RICO group really liked the demonstration, BTW

Feb 26 12:32:40 <hercules-c130>	Here is a question for people at home : How can  I got the Long and lat from fly map computer
Feb 26 12:33:26 <darrel-c130>	Janet, mission accomplished. It took two guesses but I figured it out. It wasn't steel magnolias!
Feb 26 12:34:18 <darrel-c130>	Jeff, how was Olga's presentation?
Feb 26 12:34:20 <schanot>	everything still on track for a 1630 return?
Feb 26 12:34:56 <darrel-c130>	I'll ask
Feb 26 12:36:26 <stith>	Darrel, Olga did great.   I hope we can coordinate our measurments with her. 
Feb 26 12:37:23 <stith>	I'm off to return to the RICO meeting.   Keep up the great work.   And pass along my thanks to the flight crew for their hard flying efforts.  
Feb 26 12:39:54 <sabl-c130>	Mike or Bruce, is it ok/safe to lase down at 4000 feet over the coast?
Feb 26 12:40:40 <darrel-c130>	Al, pilots estimate between 4:15 and 4:30.
Feb 26 12:41:22 <schanot>	Mike is out for a while.  I don't think reflection will be a proiblem with this sea state.  should be no eye safety issues over the water.
Feb 26 12:41:44 <schanot>	Thanks Darrel.
Feb 26 12:42:32 <schanot>	Jonathan, it will be 20-30 minutes before Mike returns.  I assume you need an answer before then?
Feb 26 12:44:03 <sabl-c130>	20-30 minutes should be ok. Thanks.

Feb 26 12:59:18 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Al, I don't think that Hercules has the new password. You might start with the old one and then try the new one.
Feb 26 13:00:19 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Ta, You have the Lat Lon on ADS.  Are you looking for some way to see them on the Jeppsen chart?
Feb 26 13:01:25 <anstett>	i'm 99% sure that hercules has the new password.
Feb 26 13:03:35 <anstett>	anyways, darrel said that he did figure out the password on hercules.  Hercules is the new one and most of the laptops on the plane are most likely the old password.
Feb 26 13:07:58 <hercules-c130>	Yes!John PI want lat&long able display on Jeppsen gird chart
Feb 26 13:09:14 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Let me see if Larry knows.
Feb 26 13:09:47 <hercules-c130>	Also Just let you know ADS have a new Password 
Feb 26 13:13:03 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Ta, We cannot figuar it out here because we do not have a Jep display.  They should be able to see that Lat Lon on the laptop.  You could mess with the computer by you and see if you can get it to come up.  Sorry.  Thanks for the info on the pasword. I'm glad you klnow what the new one is.
Feb 26 13:15:30 <darrel-c130>	If Larry is around, I forgot to acknowledge his questionon RDMA. It seems healthy, biggest problem is maintaining 80% humidity on neph.
Feb 26 13:16:23 <hercules-c130>	Okay!Thanks John. I will try
Feb 26 13:20:15 <schanot>	mike is back.  Jonathan
Feb 26 13:22:09 <schanot>	jonathan, do not lase down over land except in the lagoon area at the north end of this track
Feb 26 13:23:37 <schanot>	jonathan, if you are 1000 meter above ground over the lagoon it is ok to lase down
Feb 26 13:24:13 <sabl-c130>	OK, that is what I thought, Thanks!
Feb 26 13:25:11 <schanot>	how deep is the boundry layer today?
Feb 26 13:25:24 <sabl-c130>	just to make sure, just hte lagoon and not the coast line, is this right?
Feb 26 13:28:03 <schanot>	you probably will not be above 1000 meter on ferry to/from airport. the rule is no lasing over ground except in the lagoon area and no lasing looking down if below 1000 meter

Feb 26 14:14:53 <schanot>	OK. they just left to get set up.  I will monitor chat until 1540. then leave for the airport.
Feb 26 14:21:41 <genzling>	Al, Shelley says we need to book the hotel rooms and charge the credit cards for the Rico Projedt now. Should we doit now. Shannon wants some guidance

Feb 26 14:24:27 <genzling>	al, the reeason we are asking is that 3 days will be charged to the card.  Shannon is seeing Gerry to see if we can use another credit card to hold them all

Feb 26 14:25:07 <schanot>	Yes, but! I thought the plan was to have NCAR prepay the rooms.  This will be very hard for people to handle on personal CC.  Which do they propose?
Feb 26 14:26:14 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Looks like the 130 went offline.
Feb 26 14:26:16 <schanot>	i thought the rooms had to be completely prepaid months in advance, if not immediately on booking
Feb 26 14:27:47 <schanot>	on some projects NCAR just pays all the rooms on a contract.  then people just gets the base perdiem for the rest.
Feb 26 14:28:24 <schanot>	that would be best in this case.  jORGEN HAS THE TRAVEL SPECIFICS ON EVERYBODY
Feb 26 14:29:42 <schanot>	I don't think my credit card can handle any more at the moment.  particularly since the phone lines from here are part of my bill and I don't know what that is going to come in at!
Feb 26 14:29:46 <genzling>	Shannon is calling the hotel to see if we can use one credit card to reserve all of the rooms 
Feb 26 14:30:39 <genzling>	Shannon has the dates and the people but that could change if some one quits or new hires etc
Feb 26 14:30:54 <schanot>	OK.  We do need to take action right away, though.  BB says there will be over 104 non-NCAR researchers on the island for RICO.
Feb 26 14:31:25 <schanot>	we'll just have to adjust with necessary changes.  better to have rooms in hand for the rest
Feb 26 14:31:34 <genzling>	That means we really do need ot get our foot in the door!
Feb 26 14:31:45 <schanot>	i agree
Feb 26 14:33:27 <schanot>	John:  ION data feed is also down.  you want to try and call them via the std SATCOM?
Feb 26 14:35:31 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	I can try Al. I will have to try and find the number.
Feb 26 14:35:44 <schanot>	they had a fairly long drop out earlier
Feb 26 14:36:28 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	I saw that also, but not all the computers dropped off chat at once.  I think I have the file online.
Feb 26 14:36:32 <schanot>	they are due back between 1615 and 1630 local anyway.  just nice to know they are still safe and flying
Feb 26 14:38:15 <schanot>	got to go in five to make the airport in time.  grid lock on the road today according to kurt.  they didn't move for 5-10 minutes.  said it was clearing though
Feb 26 14:38:52 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Okay Al I will try and give them a call.  If I cannot get thru or find them I will call you on your Cell.
Feb 26 14:41:16 <schanot>	thanks. i'm out of here!
Feb 26 14:41:55 <schanot>	cell phone coverage is spotty on the road to the airport.
Feb 26 14:42:52 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	I'll just keep trying.  I'm still trying to find the numbers.
