Feb 12 09:14:42 <unam-c130>	Hey Janet you still there?
Feb 12 09:14:54 <anstett>	I'm not running xchat here because of firewall issues, so I don't know offhand how to change text size.
Feb 12 09:15:33 <unam-c130>	I need to know how to get rid of a "chat room" named airs 2 on Clyde.  Do you know how?
Feb 12 09:15:54 <sabl-c130>	Thanks - I don't have any news aboutthe seatainer

Feb 12 09:16:55 -->	cockpit-c130 (~ads@ras60.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 12 09:17:07 <anstett>	so are you saying that the xchat automatically logs into airs2 on clyde?
Feb 12 09:17:14 <--	cockpit-c130 has quit ([x]chat)
Feb 12 09:18:28 <unam-c130>	It tries to.  There are 2 chat rooms, one being #C130 the other being #AIRS2.  You have to choose the #C130 one.  If I get rid of the #airs2 it will just come up to #c130.
Feb 12 09:18:41 <unam-c130>	tHIS IS jOHN btw.
Feb 12 09:19:45 <anstett>	there is an option in one of the menus to bring up the server list.  then find the syrah server and select the airs2 chat room and delete it.
Feb 12 09:21:31 <anstett>	I think the syrah server is in the list as C130 chat.

Feb 12 09:22:05 <sabl-c130>	hi sabl is online
Feb 12 09:22:30 <sabl-c130>	we figured out how to change the font size
Feb 12 09:22:40 <unam-c130>	I cannot find the syrah server.  we use irc.perl.org? I know that you configuar to connect to these chanels on startup.  I will keep looking.
Feb 12 09:23:12 <sabl-c130>	sam says if teresa is at hotel ops center
Feb 12 09:23:39 <anstett>	do you have the server list up?  there should be a separate entry for C130 chat server.  It is a main entry, not a sub entry.
Feb 12 09:23:54 <anstett>	teresa left for the airport about 20 minutes ago.
Feb 12 09:24:12 <sabl-c130>	sam - thanks
Feb 12 09:24:49 <anstett>	There are lots of options in xchat to change almost anything.
Feb 12 09:25:06 <unam-c130>	I see that.  It is called C130 chat server.  When I click on iy I see a #airs2 channel.  Should I just delete that?  I do NOT see the #c130 channel.
Feb 12 09:25:53 <anstett>	just delete the airs2 channel and then log out and restart the xchat session to see what it does.  c130 channel can always be added again.
Feb 12 09:26:23 <unam-c130>	Okay I will give that a try.  Changing now.
Feb 12 09:27:26 <unam-c130>	\It's changed.  I will restart.

Feb 12 09:28:42 <clyde-c130>	It did.  I had to edit the channel list.
