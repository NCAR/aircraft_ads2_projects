Feb 09 11:23:58 <Ron>	Allen, I'm here now
Feb 09 11:29:43 <schanot>	Hi Ron.  Fun never ends.
Feb 09 11:30:01 -->	jbj (~80755411@linus.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 09 11:30:07 <jbj>	G'day Al,
Feb 09 11:30:12 <schanot>	Can you get Shannon for me?  We want to know specifics on Ed Ringlemans arrival
Feb 09 11:30:15 <jbj>	At leas one thing is working
Feb 09 11:32:05 <jbj>	Shannon is not here, we will get Patsy online within a few minutes
Feb 09 11:32:49 <schanot>	Can you call Mike Daniels and get him linked up?  We have to decide about Jody
Feb 09 11:35:20 <schanot>	Ron.  Are you still there?  It looks like it
Feb 09 11:35:52 <Ron>	Allen, yes
Feb 09 11:36:01 <Ron>	I'm trying to get Patsy set up.
Feb 09 11:36:20 <schanot>	Hi Jorgen.  We are currently washing the C-130 and I can't reach the mechs
Feb 09 11:36:56 <schanot>	We will discuss shipping plans at the meeting to be held at 1300 your time
Feb 09 11:37:56 <jbj>	OK
Feb 09 11:38:14 <schanot>	we need to know arrival info on Ed Ringleman.  It chged late in the prep.  we think today.  time?
Feb 09 11:39:50 <jbj>	Al, if a truck delivers all the goods, can you store it there; i.e. by not hasving a seatainer?
Feb 09 11:41:34 -->	ruth (~8075541b@linus.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 09 11:42:09 <ruth>	Chat test from PostNuke on ron's workstation
Feb 09 11:42:25 <ruth>	OK.  Now to try Patsy's
Feb 09 11:43:24 <schanot>	yes.  we have a big space.  getting it in will be very difficult.  bad access for heavy stuff.  now lifting equipment
Feb 09 11:44:25 <schanot>	location at opposite end of airport.  it will be secure, but i'm thinking it's a bad option
Feb 09 11:46:18 <jbj>	OK, will let you know. kerry is phoning through to the Mexicans once more. It sounds like the situation is unclear - maybe the truck is already on the road in Mexico, maybe not.
Feb 09 11:46:25 <schanot>	as we continue to think, big problems moving the pieces around.  
Feb 09 11:46:43 <jbj>	Can you rent a pick-up?
Feb 09 11:48:00 <schanot>	won't help.  we are talking major hernias.  reloading at end major problem as well.  most stuff is backup and not
Feb 09 11:48:51 <schanot>	likely to be used.  We hoped not to move most pieces at all.  that was the nice thing about keeping the seatainer on truck
Feb 09 11:49:26 <jbj>	Can you rent an empty seatainer to put right outside?
Feb 09 11:50:36 <schanot>	not likely.  still have problems moviing the stuff.  best option likely return most to JeffCo and air freight key pieces

Feb 09 11:55:12 <jbj>	Hi Al,
Feb 09 11:55:36 <jbj>	is myc hat working. Last message from you detailed potential hernisa - everything later I lost.
Feb 09 11:56:59 <Ron>	Jorgen,  I've been monitoring.  No other chat.
Feb 09 11:59:04 <schanot>	this shipment of pieces will pose major problems.  that was hernias as in personal injury
Feb 09 12:01:02 <schanot>	Ron, tell Mike Daniels we have put Jody's extension on hold.  maybe have someone return later in project if part shows up
Feb 09 12:02:30 <Ron>	Allen, Will do.  He's out of town this week, so I'll tell whoever is in charge
Feb 09 12:04:25 <jbj>	I understant about hernias. Kerry is trying to find out if the shipment is already on its way. If not, then let us know what you want us to do.
Feb 09 12:05:13 <jbj>	The transfer was not authorized.
Feb 09 12:08:13 <schanot>	i'm goin g to cut chat for now.  let's get back on at 1330 your time.

Feb 09 13:03:52 <schanot>	meeting started
Feb 09 13:06:56 <jbj>	Hi Meeting here also started - Ron told me you are on, and we are awaiting news from you.
Feb 09 13:30:55 <jbj>	Any news, Al?
Feb 09 13:39:03 <schanot>	yes
Feb 09 13:39:48 <schanot>	do you have any news on where the shipment is?
Feb 09 13:40:31 <jbj>	Yes, read eamil, but right this moment I do not know if it is in the US and Mexico. repeat - delivery scheduled for Wednesday evening
Feb 09 13:41:08 <schanot>	the consencess here is we need the stuff and will deal with the consequences
Feb 09 13:41:54 <schanot>	anything new on the air freight shipment Bob Olson sent?
Feb 09 13:42:03 <jbj>	I assume)
Feb 09 13:42:24 <schanot>	what do you assume?
Feb 09 13:42:47 <jbj>	Sorry- my message scrambled. You should be able to keep box-trailer for storage where you want it.
Feb 09 13:43:19 <jbj>	Olson shipment: small box with fire detection system is caught in customs, and he may return it to here.
Feb 09 13:43:39 <jbj>	Other shipment was prepared by Shertz - have you received that?
Feb 09 13:44:16 <schanot>	no, but it takes around 7-8 days for air freight to make it through
Feb 09 13:44:31 <jbj>	OK
Feb 09 13:44:43 <jbj>	What do you want me to check from here?
Feb 09 13:45:17 <schanot>	Bob Olson had a vendor ship a fire detector to us FedEx.  No prep with Slaven.  Held for broker.  Slaven alerted. no new news
Feb 09 13:46:01 <jbj>	Yes, that is the unit Bob thinks he will have returned to jeffCo.
Feb 09 13:46:24 <jbj>	Have you read my email  regarding Wednesday delivery of large shipment?
Feb 09 13:47:17 <schanot>	no. i'll do that now.  where did shertz send the shipment?  hotel or airport?
Feb 09 13:48:43 <jbj>	Will find out about Shertz shipment.
Feb 09 13:49:48 <schanot>	problem with night time delivery.  we need this thing at the airport.  airport closed in PM after 1800 local.  need daytime even if
Feb 09 13:49:57 <schanot>	delayed another day.
Feb 09 13:50:44 <schanot>	no weather on horizon until the weekend.  Friday - Sunday look like next opportunity
Feb 09 13:50:58 <jbj>	OK, will pass message regarding airport closure to Kerry Slaven.
Feb 09 13:52:22 <jbj>	Shertz shipment is in trouble. Apparently the commercial invoice was lost, and Kerry has to create a new one. Steve assumes that it was lost by the commercial shipper.
Feb 09 13:53:35 <schanot>	I assume the box trailer is left with wheels and all.  want to bet that the stuff we don't need right away is in the front?
Feb 09 13:55:00 <jbj>	Yes, I assume so. But the order of the boxes may have been scrambled, as the Mexicans too boxes out of one seatainer and into another box-trailer.
Feb 09 13:57:43 <schanot>	it will be interesting to see how the shipping goes for NAME
Feb 09 13:58:06 <jbj>	Probably without a hitch!@#$%^*
Feb 09 13:58:33 <schanot>	the Users want us to keep Jody to get the satelite system up and running.  Mike Daniels has approved, but he needs to be
Feb 09 13:59:15 <schanot>	contacted with confirmation.  hotel is full. she may bunk of site with the SCRIPPS folks for acouple of days
Feb 09 13:59:59 <jbj>	We will contact him.
Feb 09 14:00:22 <schanot>	interesting, we never promised these guys a satelite system.  I'll be curious to see how their review of the project goes.
Feb 09 14:01:14 <jbj>	Yes - I agree.
Feb 09 14:01:25 <schanot>	we are having some problems with CO2 and the TDL.  both were noted as provisional sensors, but that won't hold water for Carl
Feb 09 14:02:11 <schanot>	sure am glad we have three!!! classic cases in hand already
Feb 09 14:02:49 <schanot>	guess we've done all we can for now.  this chat communications seems to have helped from our end
Feb 09 14:03:14 <schanot>	do you think it is too cumbersome?  
Feb 09 14:04:18 <jbj>	coffee making, etc.) , bu having Ron check it is also a great help. between us it should work well.
Feb 09 14:04:45 <jbj>	Sorry, scrambled again. Chat cannot handle backspaces. Chat is OK.
Feb 09 14:05:29 <Ron>	Chat works for me so long as I can type the characters correctly.
Feb 09 14:05:58 <jbj>	That is exactly my difficulty. Hopefully a margurita will sort that one out.
Feb 09 14:06:53 <schanot>	when you get here, i'll buy.
Feb 09 14:07:02 <jbj>	Thanx
