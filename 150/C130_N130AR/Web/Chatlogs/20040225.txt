Feb 25 09:43:15 <schanot>	hi janet.  epson still won't print.  button will not move cartridges to proper location.  moved it manually with power off.
Feb 25 09:43:49 <schanot>	i tried the cleaning routine many many many times with no joy.  this is last resort
Feb 25 09:43:50 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Bill, you ganna be a "movie start" ? <g>.
Feb 25 09:45:37 <hercules-c130>	I'm trying not to break the lens, movies and stills.
Feb 25 09:46:32 <hercules-c130>	Actually all I'm really good for is turning on and off lights..
Feb 25 09:47:42 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Quick on Hockey, the guy from the Ducks is pretty good.  He is big going 225 at 6-2. Seems to play well so far. The Blues and Pheonix fired thier coaches today. Av's lost last night.
Feb 25 09:48:05 <anstett>	if the printer is not printing at all, replacing the print cartridges may not help either.
Feb 25 09:49:50 <schanot>	looks like the cartridge change worked.  some slop on the edge, but I can use the print as is
Feb 25 09:50:34 <schanot>	the hot chocolate is still great! just finished my morning cup
Feb 25 09:51:43 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Al you are going to pay for all that chocolate.  I'm still trying to loose the weight I picked up <g>.
Feb 25 09:54:28 <schanot>	i'm sure you are right.
Feb 25 09:55:36 <hercules-c130>	me too, you guys had everything set up so nice, we haven't had to do very much
Feb 25 09:56:08 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Just wait.  Packing out will work some of it off of you <g>.
Feb 25 09:56:50 <hercules-c130>	true, so who's the other guy we got and from where, skoula went to the ducks right
Feb 25 09:58:42 <hercules-c130>	skoula for th??is big defensemen from the ducks, right, sauer is his name
Feb 25 10:01:15 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Yep.  Skoula is gone to the Ducks for, I think sauer and a draft pick in '05, fourth round I think.
Feb 25 10:01:55 <hercules-c130>	cool, and who's the other trade for and who'd we give up?
Feb 25 10:04:05 <anstett>	instructions from the epson manual to follow
Feb 25 10:04:11 <anstett>	How To / Replacing Ink Cartridges
Feb 25 10:04:11 <anstett>	To replace an ink cartridge using the printer's control panel, follow the steps below.
Feb 25 10:04:11 <anstett>		Make sure the printer is on. The power light should be on, but not flashing. (Determine which cartridge needs to be replaced as indicated by the black and color ink out light.)
Feb 25 10:04:11 <anstett>		Lower the output tray at the front of the printer, then open the printer cover.
Feb 25 10:04:11 <anstett>		Hold down the cleaning button for three seconds. The print head moves left to the ink cartridge replacement position, and the power light begins flashing.
Feb 25 10:04:14 <anstett>			Caution:
Feb 25 10:04:16 <anstett>			Do not move the print head by hand as this may damage the printer. Always use the cleaning button to move it.
Feb 25 10:04:19 <anstett>			Note:
Feb 25 10:04:21 <anstett>			If you press the cleaning button for three seconds when the black and color ink out lights are off, the printer starts cleaning the print head.
Feb 25 10:05:02 <schanot>	Bill, this Kurt.  I need you to compare the FWD video GPS time with the time on on of the DSM, FWD time card.  THe LEDS on the card and let me know if there is any difference in time?
Feb 25 10:05:35 <schanot>	Secondly, do you have an ETA?
Feb 25 10:06:52 <hercules-c130>	the time difference is approx. 1.5  seconds (best guess)
Feb 25 10:09:35 <hercules-c130>	kurt that time difference i gave you is from the display in discwin and the display on vcr monitor
Feb 25 10:10:33 <hercules-c130>	that time also matches up nicely with the time on the front of the fwd dsm 
Feb 25 10:11:37 <hercules-c130>	and the red clock numbers on the timing card
Feb 25 10:12:14 <hercules-c130>	ETA is about an hour from now
Feb 25 10:12:22 <schanot>	fine.  What is youe ETA back at Huatulco?  still 1215?
Feb 25 10:13:22 <hercules-c130>	these long flights kill me

Feb 25 10:32:48 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Don't know if it is logged on all machines.  It may have gotten lost in all the stuff Janet sent.

Feb 25 10:33:38 <hercules-c130>	if you saw it, it had to go out, oh well, headed for pictures of a weather radar station, then home
Feb 25 10:34:02 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	You get time stamps on the far left of your screen.  I don't have them on my screen at all.  I do not remember if the chat on the website has timestamps or not.
Feb 25 10:34:21 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	The message went out, it may not have had a timestamp at our end.
Feb 25 10:34:37 <hercules-c130>	ah
