Feb 27 08:04:54 <schanot>	Hello C-130.  We are up in the data center
Feb 27 08:06:09 <schanot>	Darrel- I see the well defined plume again
Feb 27 08:06:23 <hercules-c130>	howdy, fairly bumpy +- 20 m/sec.  not much more than that a the present time.
Feb 27 08:06:40 <schanot>	will check Quilscat for update
Feb 27 08:07:19 <schanot>	wind speeds look alot like yesterday.  hopefully they will increase as the flight progrsses
Feb 27 08:11:35 <hercules-c130>	wish you were on board!
Feb 27 08:13:58 <schanot>	got the edge of a quikscat pass.  looks fairly old.  hard to read swath times
Feb 27 08:15:38 <schanot>	wind direction south of 15N seems pretty steady at 030 to 035 degrees down to 10N.  more northerly near coast
Feb 27 08:15:57 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	It's supposed to be 62 today with sun.  This weekend we will have a front move through with maybe some snow.  Next week is clear highs in the 40's.
Feb 27 08:16:44 <schanot>	max speeds around 30-35 knts.  will check again later for more updates
Feb 27 08:21:16 <bruce>	Hi Mike.  I am here.  How's the boss?
Feb 27 08:21:43 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	I'm going to go work in the back lab.  I'll check for updates about every 30 min or so.  Have a good flight.
Feb 27 08:24:14 <darrel-c130>	Hi Al, Good plume indeed. Multiple passes in fron of outflow with identical signatures in particles and fast O3
Feb 27 08:26:21 <sabl-c130>	all ok tody, could you ask eric, shane, scott about their needs to work on sabl immediately after we return. jeffco people are starting to ask if we want to pull the pod asap or play with it thurs/fri
Feb 27 08:29:08 <bruce>	I will ask.  Do you know of any SABL problems that can't wait?

Feb 27 08:34:17 <sabl-c130>	all issues i know of can wait. 
Feb 27 08:36:41 <bruce>	Thanks.  I will pass that along.
Feb 27 09:06:06 <schanot>	hello Kurt
Feb 27 09:12:53 <schanot>	Kurt- we need to bring the satelite laptop back to the GALA in order to stow the antenna in the blue box/
Feb 27 09:14:08 <schanot>	we'll probably wait until we come back to pick you guys up.  then move all components back to the airport tomorrow.
Feb 27 09:17:52 <hercules-c130>	to bad we didn't think of that earlier, oh well!
Feb 27 09:24:25 <schanot>	Hi Lowell - thanks to you and Shannon for taking care of the RICO housing.  Are we confirmed now?
Feb 27 09:36:46 <genzling>	She was calling this morning and I haven't heard yet will let you know what is happening

Feb 27 09:49:39 <schanot>	Kurt- there will be a "wing stores" discussion for RICO this afternoon at JeffCO.  We are to participate via chat if possible
Feb 27 09:51:18 <schanot>	yo darrel.  looks like you caught the plume at your current distance!!
Feb 27 09:52:22 <schanot>	the wind field is more uniform today.  not as much veering with distance from shore.
Feb 27 09:54:47 <hercules-c130>	i'll do what i can from here
Feb 27 09:57:27 <schanot>	newest quikscat fails to show current event, even though we have regional coverage,  alternate pass on edge, but show some signs of what you are seeing.
Feb 27 09:59:20 -->	clyde-c130 (~ads@ras16.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 27 10:51:18 <darrel-c130>	Al, we also caught the plume out here.
Feb 27 10:57:17 <genzling>	Al, Shannon has all the rooms reserved  on my corporate account.  She wants an ocean view and a red convertible.  Sooner or late4r evceryone will have to call and give their own credit card.

Feb 27 11:17:50 <genzling>	Al, Customs called and said the overflight is approved.  I said I'd let them know your ETA as it get closer.  The phone No there is 303-271-4884 if you want to call enroute.
Feb 27 11:49:52 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Well Kurt I'm getting ready to leave.  Hop you have a good flight.  Are there plans to fly this weekend?
Feb 27 12:05:26 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Bye
Feb 27 12:05:27 <--	Jcowan-Jeffco has quit (Leaving)
Feb 27 12:15:30 <bruce>	Mike,  no chances for looking down on this flight!
Feb 27 12:21:30 <sabl-c130>	another half hour and we will start a 4000 ft leg to the coast. will take about 50 minutes
Feb 27 12:23:32 <sabl-c130>	we are getting many sun shots. none that saturate the receiver. mostly in the greens and yellows.
Feb 27 12:24:19 <sabl-c130>	mbl is a good attenuator today.
Feb 27 12:26:52 -->	allen (~c842a1c1@linus.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 27 12:27:29 <allen>	hello C-130.  how are things going?
Feb 27 12:28:56 <sabl-c130>	just started leg 61
Feb 27 12:30:18 <darrel-c130>	Seems similar to yesterday. Plume axis to west of wind core.
Feb 27 12:31:17 <allen>	we tracked that for a while.  been off line for about an hour. looks like a solid case
Feb 27 12:43:39 <schanot>	am i still up as schanot?
Feb 27 12:44:25 <--	allen has quit (CGI:IRC (EOF))
Feb 27 12:48:20 <schanot>	OK Lowell - I got the info on the RICO rooms and the customs approval for JeffCO.  That will make it a much shorter day.
Feb 27 12:49:11 <schanot>	I am going to try and arrange to pack the C-130 on Tuesday and clear Mexican customs then leaving just personal luggage for Wednesday.
Feb 27 12:50:14 <schanot>	We were going to try and get in between 1400 and 1500 MST, but will have to let you know early next week.

Feb 27 13:08:58 <jbj>	Hi Al,
Feb 27 13:16:42 <sabl-c130>	bruce, you still there
Feb 27 13:20:59 <bruce>	Mike,  I just returned.  What's up?
Feb 27 13:21:11 <genzling>	Al, I told her it would probably be about 3:00 Pm but would update as it got closer
Feb 27 13:23:31 <bruce>	I just read your comments about sun into the receiver - doesn't look like a direct shot of the sun yet 
Feb 27 13:23:58 <sabl-c130>	have you talked to others about taking racks out of c130 thurs/fri?
Feb 27 13:24:37 <bruce>	Not yet.  Is that what has been requested?
Feb 27 13:26:17 <sabl-c130>	do not know.  we need to decide what we want to ask raf. get things off before wash or after.
Feb 27 13:27:35 <bruce>	Our first choice is to put the window blank in and remove pod and racks later.
Feb 27 13:28:34 <sabl-c130>	ok, we need to tell bob olsen our intentions.
Feb 27 13:29:27 <bruce>	I sent an email to al and jens but will follow up so everyone is on the same page.
Feb 27 13:30:57 <sabl-c130>	great. we are finally looking down but not seeing much. i think we might be salted over today
Feb 27 13:33:30 <bruce>	You did spend a lot of time down low today.  You have earned yur pool time!  Check with Jefe first.
Feb 27 13:34:33 <sabl-c130>	the cockpit camera looking forward is just a grey blob. jefe approved my pool time

Feb 27 13:52:46 <--	dcrogers has quit (CGI:IRC)
Feb 27 13:54:00 <schanot>	hello C-130.  any update on ETA back to Huatulco?
Feb 27 13:57:08 <--	cockpit-c130 has quit ([x]chat)
Feb 27 14:01:10 <darrel-c130>	Dave, Today's flight was pretty muchlike yestreday's. Everything working well with both good supermicron and pollution mapping data. Diffren appears to be wind shift from NNE to SE with altitude. This gives interesting structure aloft to particle andd ozone. We will do one more mapping of plume before coming home.   Al, I'll check ETA.
Feb 27 14:02:17 <darrel-c130>	Just talked to Ed and he expects 4:10 touch down.
Feb 27 14:03:40 <schanot>	OK. thanks
Feb 27 14:04:47 <schanot>	try and get the down sun approach.  sounds like you're good and salty today
Feb 27 14:06:29 <darrel-c130>	I'll pass along the recommendation. I took a shower today, so only my humor is salty. 
Feb 27 14:08:12 <schanot>	I got salty the old fashioned way...... got dipped in the ocean.  glad you guys only got sprayed
Feb 27 14:09:14 <schanot>	Kurt- No action needed from you on the RICO wing stores right now.  Jorgen got input from Spowart on power and wiring to the wings.
Feb 27 14:09:51 <schanot>	Jorgen & I talked over some of the other impacts.  This won't be a final decision today, in any case.
