Feb 19 13:12:02 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Sounds like there are some really issues with that satellite link.
Feb 19 13:13:48 <bruce>	Mike and Jonathon  -  Have you had a chance to look down much today?  Doesn't look like it from the flight profile.
Feb 19 13:15:41 <sabl-c130>	We have been flying low most of the day.
Feb 19 13:41:36 <schanot>	yo kurt.  any update on your eta?  still 1600 local?
Feb 19 13:44:51 <daniels>	more satcom updates
Feb 19 13:45:06 <daniels>	skycasters said they are working on a software fix
Feb 19 13:45:27 <daniels>	this would allow the system to communicate w/ a different satellite
Feb 19 13:45:42 <daniels>	install would be a modem download and would take 30 min to 1 hour
Feb 19 13:45:54 <daniels>	they want to do this before sending any hardware
Feb 19 13:46:05 <daniels>	therefore, brandon is on hold until further notice
Feb 19 13:47:33 <sabl-c130>	allen, the training flight went wel.  We will only need one person to fly from now on.
Feb 19 13:50:58 <schanot>	sounds good sabl.  can you guys get us an eta for the airport?
Feb 19 13:52:18 <schanot>	mike daniels - how/who is going to make that work
Feb 19 13:55:18 <hercules-c130>	our eta from the cockpit is ~1608
Feb 19 13:57:17 <schanot>	bruce - are you on?
Feb 19 13:57:29 <hercules-c130>	john are you there?
Feb 19 13:59:12 <daniels>	allen: skycasters will contact us when the software update is ready.  they are testing it.  then, someone down there will have to download and install it on the satcom laptop.
Feb 19 14:00:00 <schanot>	and you are thinking of me?  i'm barely computer literate!
Feb 19 14:00:56 <schanot>	i think we can get sufficient help from some of the Users.
Feb 19 14:02:06 <schanot>	i assume that their are going to disable the 80% transmit shut down algorithmn?
Feb 19 14:04:23 <schanot>	going to have to head for the airport in a few minutes.  anything else?
Feb 19 14:04:31 <daniels>	yes you
Feb 19 14:04:51 <daniels>	nothing else, just that update

Feb 19 14:13:35 <hercules-c130>	tell him that the rw dsm is approaching a 2 sec gap between the others.  At what point does this become a problem? 
Feb 19 14:14:03 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Okay I'll ask.  Is it 2 sec now or just 1 sec plus?
Feb 19 14:14:25 <hercules-c130>	it's 2 sec now.
Feb 19 14:14:32 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Okay.  BRB 
Feb 19 14:15:05 <sabl-c130>	the agave laptop finally made it to a login prompt, what is the login<<</
Feb 19 14:15:32 <hercules-c130>	we have ~ 45 minutes of flight left, I don't think I want to reboot.  All appears to be working well.
Feb 19 14:16:55 <hercules-c130>	the gap is also shown on the console window.
Feb 19 14:18:11 <sabl-c130>	cowan do you know agave login and pswd
Feb 19 14:18:47 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Agave should us the standard ADS login and password.  Kurt should know those.
Feb 19 14:19:21 <sabl-c130>	he got the login but it is still fubar
Feb 19 14:19:34 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Kurt, Mike is in with Jeff.  I don't think you nhave to reboot the system.  S aimple recylce for the RW DSM is all you should need to do.
Feb 19 14:19:47 <hercules-c130>	I have the login in but it hangs
Feb 19 14:20:01 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Is it accepting the password?
Feb 19 14:20:25 <hercules-c130>	I'm not going to reboot the rw at this point.
Feb 19 14:21:01 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Janet is going to login to chat to see if she can help with Agave.

Feb 19 14:22:58 <hercules-c130>	janet was does respawning mean?
Feb 19 14:23:51 <anstett>	sounds like /var might be full. try CTRL-ALT-F1 to get the text login.
Feb 19 14:24:09 <anstett>	then log in as root and do a df - see if / is full.
Feb 19 14:24:54 <hercules-c130>	all i get is ads@agave
Feb 19 14:26:39 <anstett>	you are getting ads@agave when you hit CTRL-ALT-F1 at the same time?
Feb 19 14:27:58 <hercules-c130>	the command does nothing, if i hit the enter key i keep getting ads@agave and some script after it?
Feb 19 14:31:01 <sabl-c130>	what is the password for root?
Feb 19 14:31:09 <anstett>	can you type any commands?  are you in xwindows with multiple windows or just a black screen with a prompt?
Feb 19 14:31:37 <hercules-c130>	black sceen with a prompt
Feb 19 14:32:10 <anstett>	Does CTRL-ALT-F7 do anything?
Feb 19 14:33:24 <hercules-c130>	no, ijust rebooted..give me a minute
Feb 19 14:38:11 <hercules-c130>	Janet, rebooting gets me back to the same screen.  I don't know the root password if it's different from the ads password.
Feb 19 14:38:21 <anstett>	[]
