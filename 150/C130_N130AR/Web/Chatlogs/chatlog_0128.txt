Jan 28 12:52:04 -->	You are now talking on #C130Q
Jan 28 12:56:56 -->	jOHN (~Jcowan@dyn84-150.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Jan 28 12:58:45 -->	dcrogers (~807554c7@linus.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Jan 28 12:59:16 <dcrogers>	yo, John -- are you on c130?
Jan 28 13:01:37 <jOHN>	No I'm on the ground Dave.
Jan 28 13:02:34 ---	jOHN is now known as Jcowan
Jan 28 13:03:24 <Jcowan>	Larry in the only tech on board today.
Jan 28 13:04:39 <Ron>	John, will Larry try to activate Chat on the C-130?
Jan 28 13:06:43 <Jcowan>	Ron, We asked him to before they left.  I hope he does.  George said that he tried chat on the last flight but that no one on the ground was there.
Jan 28 13:07:25 <Jcowan>	If not I guess we can check it on the ground friday morning before they leave.
Jan 28 13:16:44 -->	DaveR (~dcrogers@vivaldi.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Jan 28 13:17:26 <DaveR>	I'm here twice -- once through the web page and once by using xchat on vivaldi.
Jan 28 13:21:43 <Jcowan>	Dave, does that mean we will twice the work out of you today?
Jan 28 13:21:55 -->	cockpit-c130 (~ads@ras15.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Jan 28 13:22:07 -->	hercules-c130 (~ads@ras15.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Jan 28 13:23:04 <hercules-c130>	John, are you on?
Jan 28 13:23:36 <Jcowan>	Hey Larry.  We see you do you see us?
Jan 28 13:24:03 <--	cockpit-c130 has quit ([x]chat)
Jan 28 13:24:24 <hercules-c130>	Yeah, I'm here.
Jan 28 13:24:57 <Jcowan>	Good.  We were wondering if there was a chat problem.  Hope your flight is going well.
Jan 28 13:25:18 -->	cockpit-c130 (~ads@ras15.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Jan 28 13:26:43 <Jcowan>	Are you having some phone dropouts?  It looks like if from the ion display.
Jan 28 13:27:18 <hercules-c130>	Good flight so far. Cockpit is having trouble with Chat. Al gets a "no Channel joined" message when he trys to type in the Chat window.
Jan 28 13:27:58 <Jcowan>	Ask Al if his channel is #C130Q?
Jan 28 13:28:02 <hercules-c130>	No Satcom prob detected.
Jan 28 13:30:21 <hercules-c130>	I can see hin join in as cockpit-c130 and it says "has joined #c130Q".
Jan 28 13:31:05 <Jcowan>	I see him  also.  You might try having him type again.  It sure looks like he should be hooked up okay.
Jan 28 13:31:31 <cockpit-c130>	this is Al,  Do you read?
Jan 28 13:31:48 <Jcowan>	I see you now Al, do you see me?
Jan 28 13:32:11 <cockpit-c130>	yes. operator error before
Jan 28 13:32:49 <Jcowan>	Ok.  Well it looks like chat is working fine then.
Jan 28 13:33:07 <hercules-c130>	Looks good from here.
Jan 28 13:33:41 <hercules-c130>	Can I eat my sandwich now?
Jan 28 13:33:51 <Jcowan>	Looks like you are doing a reverse heading atm this time on Ion.
Jan 28 13:34:39 <Jcowan>	Yes, I'll leave you be <grin>.
Jan 28 13:36:18 <DaveR>	wait, wait -- what kind of sandwich?
Jan 28 13:37:02 <hercules-c130>	Opps, Its gone and I forgot!
Jan 28 13:37:05 <--	dcrogers has quit (CGI:IRC)
Jan 28 13:37:33 <DaveR>	Actually, I didn't quit the chat, I'm still on the xchat.  
Jan 28 13:38:02 -->	dcrogers (~807554c7@linus.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Jan 28 13:38:32 <--	dcrogers has quit (CGI:IRC (EOF))
Jan 28 13:40:09 <DaveR>	ION shows CONCN looks okay. Can't tell about SPP-300 because huge start-up spike makes for goofy scaling.  How is SPP-300?
Jan 28 13:40:43 <DaveR>	Same question for SPP-200
Jan 28 13:40:46 <cockpit-c130>	can't tell till we drp into BL
Jan 28 13:41:03 <cockpit-c130>	200 looks OK
Jan 28 13:55:55 <Jcowan>	Hmmm,  Round and round you go and where you stop nopbody knows <grin>.
Jan 28 14:07:04 <Jcowan>	Larry let us know if you get an ETA please.
Jan 28 14:15:43 <--	cockpit-c130 has quit ([x]chat)
Jan 28 14:16:50 <hercules-c130>	about 2:45 eta
Jan 28 14:18:25 <Jcowan>	Thanks Larry.
Jan 28 14:18:40 <hercules-c130>	revised ETA: 1500 local.
Jan 28 14:20:59 <Jcowan>	Ok, thanks again.
Jan 28 14:21:04 <hercules-c130>	John, are we supposed to end diode voltages from the 260x?
Jan 28 14:21:28 <Jcowan>	I'm not sure let me chaeck.
Jan 28 14:22:45 <hercules-c130>	300 and 100 look OK.
Jan 28 14:23:25 <Jcowan>	Larry, Kurt and I think that you should be getting the N-diodes.  Bill is not here so I cannot ask him.
Jan 28 14:25:27 <hercules-c130>	Wel it's a little confusing because I am getting a consistent temp reading of 27.7 but no other housekeeping on the 260.
Jan 28 14:27:01 <Jcowan>	Hmm that is interesting.  We will have tyo let Bill know tommorow and see what he says.
Jan 28 14:28:30 <hercules-c130>	I think that we are not able to get housekeeping on the 260 anymore. I think that I remember that.
Jan 28 14:29:05 -->	cockpit-c130 (~ads@ras15.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Jan 28 14:29:45 <Jcowan>	It could be.  I'm really not sure.  We flew it in AIRS but I don't remember looking at it.
Jan 28 14:31:30 <DaveR>	As I recall, the 260x cabling was converted back to standard, which removed the housekeeping data.
Jan 28 14:32:20 <hercules-c130>	I think that you are right on Dave.
Jan 28 14:34:30 <DaveR>	OW and AIRS variable lists do not have any end element voltage or laser power, etc., for the 260x.  2D's and FSSP's have that stuff.
Jan 28 14:36:16 <Jcowan>	That could well be true.  It looks like then the 260X temp variable needs to be removed as well maybe?
Jan 28 14:38:25 <hercules-c130>	Well, my list does have P6E01 and P6E64_RWI and listed as 260X End Diode voltages.
Jan 28 14:38:38 <cockpit-c130>	we have turned for home.  is the beer cold?
Jan 28 14:39:44 <Jcowan>	Hmm, I'm not sure there is any left <grin>.
Jan 28 14:41:01 <Jcowan>	Are you still looking at 1500 ETA?
Jan 28 14:41:03 <hercules-c130>	IF 260X housekeeping is not available, then we should take them all out of the varible list.
Jan 28 14:41:24 <hercules-c130>	Si, Senor.
Jan 28 14:41:39 <Jcowan>	Goo deal.  See you then.
Jan 28 14:44:27 <DaveR>	Okay - looking at AIRS rf02 file, there are variables P6E01, P6E64. Values -0.048 to -0.065 entire flight.
Jan 28 14:47:43 <hercules-c130>	That's pretty much non-existent. Thanks.
Jan 28 14:48:53 <DaveR>	But - rf08 has values that look real.  EE voltages drop when in snow.
Jan 28 14:50:12 <hercules-c130>	R U sure that that is for the 260x?
Jan 28 14:51:26 <hercules-c130>	There was 2D probes on AIRS.
Jan 28 14:55:51 <Jcowan>	P6 would be the designation for the 260X probe.  The 2D's are 2C and 2P.
Jan 28 14:56:35 <hercules-c130>	New ETA: 15:10
Jan 28 14:58:15 <Jcowan>	Thanks for the new ETA.
Jan 28 14:58:54 <DaveR>	It looks like chat has been fairly solid throughout this flight. Is that right?
Jan 28 14:59:46 <hercules-c130>	I would agree.
Jan 28 15:01:19 <DaveR>	Also, there don't appear to be any holes in the ION real-time data. Janet will be please to know.
Jan 28 15:02:27 <Jcowan>	It looks like the problems from AIRS are gone.  The Ferry will be a good test as well.
Jan 28 15:02:41 <Jcowan>	See you on the ground Larry.
Jan 28 15:02:45 <--	Jcowan has quit (ChatZilla 0.8.31 [Mozilla rv:1.4/20030624])
Jan 28 15:03:14 <--	hercules-c130 has quit (Client Exiting)
Jan 28 15:03:57 <--	cockpit-c130 has quit ([x]chat)
Jan 28 15:09:31 <DaveR>	ciao.
Jan 28 15:09:40 <--	DaveR (~dcrogers@vivaldi.atd.ucar.edu) has left #C130Q
