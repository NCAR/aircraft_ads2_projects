Feb 23 07:40:42 <daniels>	hello
Feb 23 07:40:50 <daniels>	i've been waiting...
Feb 23 07:41:19 <schanot>	welcome my friend to the show that never ends!
Feb 23 07:41:31 <daniels>	i'm so very happy to be here
Feb 23 07:41:34 <daniels>	ha
Feb 23 07:41:56 <daniels>	what time do you want to get started?
Feb 23 07:42:00 <schanot>	OK.  I emailed Baker asking him to set a schedule for today.  nothing back from him yet
Feb 23 07:42:22 <daniels>	you have to call his cellphone -- he was not in the office over the weekend
Feb 23 07:42:31 <daniels>	he was willing to do this from home
Feb 23 07:42:53 <daniels>	i can try to call if you are ready
Feb 23 07:43:12 <schanot>	I understood that.  I indicated a potential problem on the Hughes end of things
Feb 23 07:43:28 <daniels>	what do you mean?
Feb 23 07:44:19 <schanot>	Baker said that it sometimes takes Hughes awhile to coordinate this kind of change in satelite
Feb 23 07:44:39 <daniels>	so you already talked to him?
Feb 23 07:44:58 <schanot>	this was from an email he sent to me on Friday
Feb 23 07:45:09 <daniels>	ok. got it.
Feb 23 07:45:29 <schanot>	i figured we could hit it hard today while we were all on station
Feb 23 07:45:30 <daniels>	when i talked to him on the phone he said this procedure should not take long at all
Feb 23 07:45:57 <daniels>	he said 10-15 minutes for the connection and then a few minutes for offline configuration
Feb 23 07:46:07 <schanot>	so, the gist is that we need to hook the satelite laptop to a modem line, right?
Feb 23 07:46:10 <daniels>	i just used 1 hour as the worst case
Feb 23 07:46:16 <daniels>	that is my understanding
Feb 23 07:46:33 <daniels>	he said he needs to do some sort of configuration from that laptop
Feb 23 07:46:39 <schanot>	should we just hook into one of the unused lines Jody set up here?
Feb 23 07:46:45 <daniels>	yes
Feb 23 07:47:28 <daniels>	who will be doing it?
Feb 23 07:47:36 <schanot>	OK.  Let me work on that and lets give Baker awhile to contact me
Feb 23 07:47:46 <daniels>	ok
Feb 23 07:47:54 <daniels>	is jorgen around?
Feb 23 07:48:29 <schanot>	manpower consists of me, Kurt, and The NASA guy.... but I'm the only one in the room at the moment
Feb 23 07:48:50 <schanot>	yes.  but not in the room at the moment.  what do you need?
Feb 23 07:48:59 <daniels>	i wanted to tell Jorgen that Ron Ruth's review is due to the Director's office TODAY and I haven't heard back from him on my first draft
Feb 23 07:49:31 <schanot>	roger that.  he's working on mine too.  when did this pushed so early?
Feb 23 07:49:59 <daniels>	there was an email sent quite a while ago about this.  I can check to see when...
Feb 23 07:50:15 <schanot>	didn't this used to be an april-may thing
Feb 23 07:51:09 <daniels>	not for associate scientists.  they have always been early and due the first round
Feb 23 07:51:20 <schanot>	Jorgen just came in.  he says it's on his list
Feb 23 07:51:53 <schanot>	he/we are also prepping for the RICO meeting
Feb 23 07:52:01 <daniels>	me too
Feb 23 07:52:16 <daniels>	btw, the email came out 1/29 and stith and albright were copied
Feb 23 07:52:33 <daniels>	when are you coming back?
Feb 23 07:55:31 <schanot>	am i still on?
Feb 23 07:55:37 <daniels>	yes
Feb 23 07:55:48 <schanot>	two messages dropped on this end
Feb 23 07:56:12 <daniels>	i just mentioned that the performance appraisal email came out 1/29 and stith and albright were copied
Feb 23 07:56:13 <schanot>	jorgen is new on this review thing
Feb 23 07:56:24 <daniels>	then I asked when you are coming back to CO?
Feb 23 07:56:40 <schanot>	3/3/04
Feb 23 07:57:03 <daniels>	i didn't know you were there for the duration!
Feb 23 07:57:30 <schanot>	yes, worked it out with Jorgen.  he took all of AIRS-II in Cleveland
Feb 23 07:58:00 <schanot>	Carolyn is certainly enjoying herself
Feb 23 07:58:10 <daniels>	on the beach?
Feb 23 07:58:21 <schanot>	ofcourse
Feb 23 07:58:38 <daniels>	happy to hear that!
Feb 23 07:58:53 <daniels>	what does she think of huatulco vs mazatlan?
Feb 23 07:59:12 <schanot>	how about i get the satelite system on the line and we meet back here in one hour?
Feb 23 07:59:38 <daniels>	how about 1.5 -- i've got to get the kids off to school before i leave for work?!?!
Feb 23 07:59:44 <schanot>	each has its charms.  long term - Maz has more to do
Feb 23 08:00:11 <daniels>	i have been on this chat since shortly after 7am (waiting for you!)
Feb 23 08:00:12 <schanot>	that's fine
Feb 23 08:00:17 <daniels>	see ya
Feb 23 08:00:39 <--	daniels has quit (Leaving)

Feb 23 09:28:23 -->	satcom (~d1f8cbfb@linus.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 23 09:28:52 <logger>	hi, is that you john
Feb 23 09:29:05 ---	logger is now known as daniels
Feb 23 09:31:02 <satcom>	Hello...yes it is.
Feb 23 09:31:23 <daniels>	we are expecting the hualtulco folks to respond very shortly
Feb 23 09:31:36 <daniels>	allen?
Feb 23 09:31:37 <satcom>	OK...just testing this chat
Feb 23 09:32:09 <daniels>	ok, great.  
Feb 23 09:33:22 <daniels>	i am giving them a call now
Feb 23 09:36:53 <daniels>	they will be on chat in 2 minutes
Feb 23 09:38:24 <schanot>	I'm back on line
Feb 23 09:38:30 <daniels>	john, are you there?
Feb 23 09:38:57 <satcom>	I'm here
Feb 23 09:39:37 <daniels>	ok, do you think it is worthwhile to try and give the configuration instructions over chat?
Feb 23 09:39:49 <satcom>	yes...we can try
Feb 23 09:39:52 <daniels>	allen?
Feb 23 09:41:56 <schanot>	yes
Feb 23 09:42:11 <daniels>	john is ready to give the instructions -- are you ready down there?
Feb 23 09:42:31 <schanot>	we don't have the unit on the modem quite yet
Feb 23 09:43:02 <satcom>	we do not need the satellite dish deployed at this time
Feb 23 09:43:34 <daniels>	so just disconnect the laptop and connect it to a phone line?
Feb 23 09:43:54 <schanot>	i understand that part.  i assume you want the satelite laptop hooked to a phone line
Feb 23 09:43:58 <satcom>	the laptop and the modems should be on and connected
Feb 23 09:44:31 <satcom>	yes, please connect a phone line to the laptop
Feb 23 09:46:18 <schanot>	hooked up and booting up now
Feb 23 09:47:36 <satcom>	after it is completely booted, right click on the 'WinRoute' icon in the system tray and click on "Stop WinRoute Engine"
Feb 23 09:48:34 <schanot>	WinRoute crashed on bootup
Feb 23 09:48:48 <daniels>	larry says that happens every time
Feb 23 09:48:54 <daniels>	just say ok
Feb 23 09:49:27 <satcom>	is there an incon in the system tray?
Feb 23 09:49:52 <schanot>	yes.  it is not running so can't stop it
Feb 23 09:50:01 <satcom>	ok
Feb 23 09:50:45 <satcom>	goto "Start/Programs/direcWay/web setup
Feb 23 09:51:03 <schanot>	got it
Feb 23 09:51:24 <satcom>	click on it and follow all defaults
Feb 23 09:51:56 <satcom>	it will attempt to dial out
Feb 23 09:52:01 <schanot>	asks for zip code.  didn't recognise Mexico before.  what do we do?
Feb 23 09:52:32 <satcom>	click on enter location manually and input the lat/long for your location
Feb 23 09:53:37 <satcom>	did you get a screen that said "Welcome to Web Setup"?
Feb 23 09:53:44 <schanot>	wait one
Feb 23 09:55:33 <schanot>	verifying connect now
Feb 23 09:55:50 <satcom>	good
Feb 23 09:56:20 <schanot>	need to modifgy dial up connect to use 9 for outside line.  wait one
Feb 23 09:56:50 <satcom>	ok
Feb 23 09:57:02 <schanot>	can we hookto the net through the firewall?
Feb 23 09:57:17 <daniels>	allen, one note re: lat/lon Larry Murphy is here and he said he left a note with this info.  He reports that the lat/lon he was entering is quite a bit different that what Jim Lasswell reports
Feb 23 09:57:33 <satcom>	lets try this first
Feb 23 09:57:44 <daniels>	no problem.  just wanted to note that
Feb 23 09:58:31 <schanot>	mike: Jody there to check dialup setup from here?  
Feb 23 09:59:09 <daniels>	just a sec
Feb 23 09:59:13 <daniels>	jody not at jeffco
Feb 23 09:59:24 <daniels>	what do you mean "dial up setup?"
Feb 23 09:59:45 <schanot>	this unit is not calling up the local podigy server.  set to something else internally.
Feb 23 09:59:56 <Ron>	I'm here at Jeffco if you need something.
Feb 23 10:00:06 <schanot>	wait one
Feb 23 10:00:45 <satcom>	the unit dials an 800 number to connect to the Hughes Registration Server
Feb 23 10:01:04 <daniels>	prodigy is not necessary, then.
Feb 23 10:01:09 <satcom>	no
Feb 23 10:01:12 <schanot>	That will not work from here!
Feb 23 10:01:33 <satcom>	you cannot dial an 800 number from there?
Feb 23 10:01:49 <schanot>	is larry there?
Feb 23 10:01:52 <daniels>	yes
Feb 23 10:02:19 <schanot>	how did he direct dial out to access U.S.
Feb 23 10:02:39 <daniels>	larry said you should be able to dial outside -- you need to look at the dialup networking connection on the computer on the left
Feb 23 10:02:50 <daniels>	on the far left machine if that makes sense
Feb 23 10:03:03 <schanot>	wait one
Feb 23 10:04:44 <schanot>	need root account on that machine to check settings
Feb 23 10:04:58 <satcom>	Mike, the difference in the lat/long could have been the problem all along. With an incorrect lat/long, the system timing never would have been correct
Feb 23 10:05:28 <schanot>	how accurate does the position need to be?
Feb 23 10:05:32 <daniels>	larry said he used the coordinates from the GPS in the skycasters system
Feb 23 10:05:41 <satcom>	within a minute
Feb 23 10:05:58 <satcom>	should have worked then
Feb 23 10:06:20 <satcom>	not sure why the other folks had something different
Feb 23 10:06:36 <daniels>	allen: were they at the airport?
Feb 23 10:06:59 <daniels>	i am checking into root access on that machine.  just a sec
Feb 23 10:07:27 <schanot>	we're ttying againe with dial codes
Feb 23 10:07:41 <daniels>	you don't need root access, then?
Feb 23 10:07:48 <schanot>	Larry: where is the note on the exact position?
Feb 23 10:08:05 <daniels>	larry is laughing
Feb 23 10:08:16 <daniels>	look in the book or on those yellow pieces of paper
Feb 23 10:08:48 <daniels>	gary or robert from skycasters should also know it
Feb 23 10:09:11 <schanot>	now i'm laughing
Feb 23 10:10:09 <satcom>	are you right in hualtulco?
Feb 23 10:10:10 <daniels>	trying to reach jody re: root access -- do you still need it?!?!?!!
Feb 23 10:10:31 <schanot>	we can't get directly to U.S. from these phone lines.
Feb 23 10:10:44 <daniels>	can you use a calling card?
Feb 23 10:12:21 <daniels>	sent an email to jody
Feb 23 10:12:35 <schanot>	can you give us the big picture?  why can't we access the web site via the server?
Feb 23 10:13:19 <daniels>	john: they are wondering if they can access this through a normal internet connection
Feb 23 10:13:21 <schanot>	we are trying to setup a link via the prodigy accounts that Jody setup.  That's how everything else works
Feb 23 10:13:37 <satcom>	if you can connect the laptop so that you can get to the web from it, this will work
Feb 23 10:14:32 <schanot>	will make last try on Prodigy dial up then over to server
Feb 23 10:15:12 <daniels>	if you connect via the server you will need to configure the network
Feb 23 10:15:38 <daniels>	there is a dhcp server running so it should be straightforward
Feb 23 10:17:52 <schanot>	wait one.  it will try to connect via prodigy, but won't finish
Feb 23 10:19:11 <schanot>	moving over to server
Feb 23 10:20:27 <daniels>	john, can we configure it for a dhcp network and is the laptop currently set for a static ip?
Feb 23 10:21:25 <satcom>	it is currently configured for a static ip, configure it for DHCP but we will have to reconfigure later
Feb 23 10:22:01 <daniels>	allen: right click on "My Network Places icon"
Feb 23 10:22:03 <schanot>	working on it
Feb 23 10:22:28 <schanot>	robbie know how to do it
Feb 23 10:22:48 <daniels>	note the current static settings tso that you can reconfigure back it later
Feb 23 10:23:03 <schanot>	done that already
Feb 23 10:23:35 <daniels>	ok, i was very worried that you were the one making the changes 
Feb 23 10:23:49 <satcom>	:)
Feb 23 10:23:50 <schanot>	not a chance.  you know me
Feb 23 10:24:13 <daniels>	need to run "ipconfig /all" from a command prompt after the changes are made
Feb 23 10:25:09 <schanot>	he's way ahead of you.  we're at web setup now.  
Feb 23 10:25:42 <daniels>	about time you had some competent folks down there -- THANKS ROBBIE.  OK, John can take it from here.
Feb 23 10:25:45 <satcom>	it should say that this machine is "connected to the internet"
Feb 23 10:26:36 <schanot>	downloading keys and data from registration server, etc modem authenticated, continuing
Feb 23 10:26:44 <satcom>	great!

Feb 23 10:57:28 <schanot>	not exact.  will switch to your numbers
Feb 23 10:57:49 <daniels>	but are those lat/lon for the city and not the beach?
Feb 23 10:59:05 <satcom>	how far are you from arenal?

Feb 23 11:07:56 <schanot>	working
Feb 23 11:08:36 <satcom>	after web setup, satellite longitude should read 91°
Feb 23 11:09:18 <schanot>	web setup closes. dialog box pops up.  click next. says it chged setting. reboot
Feb 23 11:10:01 <satcom>	at what point in the process does this occur?

Feb 23 11:13:10 <schanot>	hey this is rob
Feb 23 11:13:20 <schanot>	just to let you know, what is happening is this:
Feb 23 11:14:11 <schanot>	after running the web setup a couple more times, I get the same situation.  It asks me to setup email addresses, and then comes back with a page saying "your account is registered for service"
Feb 23 11:14:52 <satcom>	that's normal
Feb 23 11:15:03 <schanot>	then a click on continue closes the web reg. browser, and a dialog asks me if i want to config dialup service as a backup.
Feb 23 11:15:14 <schanot>	after selecting no
Feb 23 11:15:44 <schanot>	it says changing directway network settings, etc etc in a dialog box.
Feb 23 11:15:51 <satcom>	normal
Feb 23 11:16:08 <schanot>	then registry updates, access keys updates, network setttings updated.
Feb 23 11:16:14 <satcom>	normal
Feb 23 11:16:25 <schanot>	then either click on "restart" or "dont restart"
Feb 23 11:16:43 <schanot>	i'll restart it now again.
Feb 23 11:16:55 <satcom>	what happens if you select "don't restart"?
Feb 23 11:18:23 <schanot>	if I select dont restart, which i tried once, the satellite diagnostics appears 
Feb 23 11:18:51 <schanot>	its the same one that appears on startup
Feb 23 11:19:46 <satcom>	do you ever get to a screen that asks for the zip code again?
Feb 23 11:20:01 <schanot>	no.
Feb 23 11:20:19 <schanot>	reboot complete

Feb 23 12:33:18 <schanot>	no, its the same.
Feb 23 12:33:56 <satcom>	when you select comm 4 and click ok, you get the same message?
Feb 23 12:33:59 <schanot>	the USB<->serial port converter seems to be working
Feb 23 12:34:22 <schanot>	yes, but it appears much faster than com1,3 , which seems to mean that it is the correct port.
Feb 23 12:35:08 <schanot>	i tried wiggling the connections btw the PC and positioner & changing the USB port
Feb 23 12:35:13 <satcom>	did you check the serial connector on the back of the positioner?
Feb 23 12:35:27 <schanot>	ill disconnect it and reconnect it
Feb 23 12:38:16 <schanot>	should there be a number other than zero for "TX Serial Number"?
Feb 23 12:40:49 <satcom>	no, all zeros
Feb 23 12:41:08 <schanot>	ok, well I'm still stuck with not being able to connect.
Feb 23 12:41:38 <schanot>	I would try to replace the USB converter and serial connection if I had a spare
Feb 23 12:43:06 <satcom>	lets uninstall the datastorm software
Feb 23 12:43:23 <schanot>	ok I will. and then?
Feb 23 12:43:23 <satcom>	and reboot
Feb 23 12:44:05 <schanot>	ok

Feb 23 12:44:35 <schanot>	ok
Feb 23 12:44:37 <schanot>	one note
Feb 23 12:44:59 <schanot>	is that when I installed datastorm last time, the positioner was not on.
Feb 23 12:45:15 <schanot>	but of course it was on while I have been trying to connect..
Feb 23 12:45:21 <satcom>	that's ok. I often install it without a positioner
Feb 23 12:45:34 <schanot>	ok.
Feb 23 12:46:13 <satcom>	Va. Beach has had this system for some time. It's possible that the positioner and new software are not compatible
Feb 23 12:47:50 <schanot>	should we install 182B
Feb 23 12:47:57 <satcom>	yes
Feb 23 12:48:07 <schanot>	working
Feb 23 12:48:27 <schanot>	datastorm can't connect with mount
Feb 23 12:49:07 <satcom>	ok...lets install the dssetup one more time
Feb 23 12:50:00 <satcom>	you do have the positioner cable connected to the blue box?
Feb 23 12:51:07 <schanot>	you mean the modem? no other blue box
Feb 23 12:51:36 <satcom>	no..the cable between the black box and the large blue box
Feb 23 12:51:43 <schanot>	do you mean the antenna box?  then no
Feb 23 12:51:59 <satcom>	please connect all the cables
Feb 23 12:52:25 <schanot>	we told you we weren't connected.  
Feb 23 12:52:42 <satcom>	missed that
Feb 23 12:52:53 <schanot>	are we now in a place to hook EVERYTHING back together for the rest?
Feb 23 12:53:10 <satcom>	yes
Feb 23 12:53:45 <schanot>	we have to remove the laptop from the network to hook it up .  you understand that right?
Feb 23 12:53:55 <satcom>	yes
Feb 23 12:54:25 <schanot>	give us 10 - 15 minutes to move things around and re-connect.
Feb 23 12:54:42 <satcom>	ok..will grab a bite

Feb 23 13:20:32 <satcom>	lets install the dssetup one more time
Feb 23 13:20:32 <satcom>	
Feb 23 13:20:36 <schanot>	we're hooked up. checked status now.
Feb 23 13:21:03 <satcom>	please install the dssetup software again
Feb 23 13:23:58 <schanot>	done
Feb 23 13:24:11 <satcom>	lets open datastorm 
Feb 23 13:24:15 <schanot>	connected and ready to proceed
Feb 23 13:24:19 <schanot>	open
Feb 23 13:24:29 <satcom>	click on refresh
Feb 23 13:24:36 <schanot>	OK
Feb 23 13:24:55 <satcom>	please tell me what the log/lat is in the datastorm software
Feb 23 13:26:50 <schanot>	15.7744N 96.0945W
Feb 23 13:27:30 <satcom>	this is really different then what mapPoint is giving us
Feb 23 13:28:08 <satcom>	are you near Puerto Angel?
Feb 23 13:29:14 <schanot>	several miles east of there
Feb 23 13:30:05 <satcom>	ok...lets write down the lat/long from the datastorm, shut down the datastorm and open antenna pointing
Feb 23 13:30:26 <schanot>	and then what
Feb 23 13:30:48 <satcom>	enter the new lat/long
Feb 23 13:30:59 <schanot>	this is an out the door and down the hall communications issue now
Feb 23 13:31:04 <satcom>	be sure to go 'Next' after entering 
Feb 23 13:31:54 <schanot>	done.  how about a sequence of things to do next?
Feb 23 13:32:11 <satcom>	open the datastorm software
Feb 23 13:32:16 <satcom>	click on refresh
Feb 23 13:32:26 <satcom>	click on find satellite
Feb 23 13:32:39 <satcom>	...and wait to see if it finds the satellite
Feb 23 13:32:59 <schanot>	working
Feb 23 13:34:05 <satcom>	when it finds the satellite it will:
Feb 23 13:34:15 <satcom>	peak the receive signal
Feb 23 13:34:34 <satcom>	run an isolation test (and peak)
Feb 23 13:35:09 <satcom>	and when it passes the isolation test the software will minimize
Feb 23 13:35:41 <satcom>	at this point we should be able to surf from the laptop
Feb 23 13:38:32 <schanot>	locked on satelite
Feb 23 13:38:38 <satcom>	good
Feb 23 13:38:47 <schanot>	sinal quality 10 / stregth 126
Feb 23 13:39:04 <schanot>	where can we access the isolation test
Feb 23 13:39:18 <satcom>	it should do it itself
Feb 23 13:39:40 <satcom>	thoses figures are not good
Feb 23 13:40:03 <satcom>	are they getting any better?
Feb 23 13:43:12 <schanot>	should we rerun the alignment setup ?  only done the auto so far.  any manual adjustments via antenna pointing?
Feb 23 13:44:49 <schanot>	strength went to 135
Feb 23 13:45:04 <satcom>	signal quality?
Feb 23 13:45:44 <schanot>	10
Feb 23 13:46:06 <satcom>	did it ever say that it aquired the satellite?
Feb 23 13:47:46 <schanot>	i dont think so, status is 'dish tested', not 'tx on' or anything else
Feb 23 13:47:51 <schanot>	and surfing doesnt work
Feb 23 13:48:13 <satcom>	on the data on the left hand side of the screen, are there any N/A's?
Feb 23 13:49:39 <schanot>	dish azimuth, gps altitude, compass's have N/A
Feb 23 13:50:40 <satcom>	at this point I think we need to do some dish calibrations
Feb 23 13:50:55 <schanot>	ok.  How to proceed?
Feb 23 13:51:03 <satcom>	stow the dish
Feb 23 13:51:18 <schanot>	ok
Feb 23 13:51:54 <satcom>	after it stows we need to determine if the dish is level. Do you have any type of level?
Feb 23 13:52:58 <schanot>	no, but it's a realitivly flat roof
Feb 23 13:54:36 <satcom>	within a degree or two?
Feb 23 13:54:40 -->	lmurphy (~lmurphy@dyn84-16.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 23 13:54:57 <schanot>	I'd say yes!
Feb 23 13:55:57 <satcom>	ok...let me know when the dish is stowed
Feb 23 13:56:55 <schanot>	There's a very slight pitch for water drainage
Feb 23 13:57:04 <satcom>	ok
Feb 23 13:57:20 <schanot>	it currently stowed
Feb 23 13:57:33 <satcom>	is the pitch at the front of the dish?
Feb 23 13:58:31 <schanot>	the antenna if anything is pitched slightly forward
Feb 23 13:58:40 <satcom>	ok
Feb 23 13:59:12 <satcom>	in the datastorm software there is a drop down box that says 'counts'
Feb 23 13:59:40 <satcom>	please select 'degrees'
Feb 23 14:00:05 <satcom>	and typa a 2 in the box to the left

Feb 23 14:00:20 <schanot>	ok...
Feb 23 14:00:52 <satcom>	click on the up arrow above 'elevation' once...the dish should raise two degrees
Feb 23 14:01:54 <satcom>	in the upper right corner of the software, click on 'configure server'
Feb 23 14:02:04 <schanot>	OK
Feb 23 14:02:55 <satcom>	click on calibrate
Feb 23 14:03:04 <schanot>	OK
Feb 23 14:03:33 <satcom>	then check the 'tilt sensors' radio button and click next
Feb 23 14:04:09 <satcom>	click next until it is finished
Feb 23 14:04:53 <schanot>	done
Feb 23 14:05:12 <satcom>	close the calibration window and click the down arrow below the elevation
Feb 23 14:05:39 <schanot>	done
Feb 23 14:05:54 <satcom>	click on configure server again
Feb 23 14:06:00 <satcom>	and calibration
Feb 23 14:06:10 <schanot>	done
Feb 23 14:06:35 <schanot>	dish compass or tilt sensor
Feb 23 14:06:47 <satcom>	click on the dish calibration and click next
Feb 23 14:07:02 <satcom>	this will take about eight minutes
Feb 23 14:07:03 <schanot>	done
Feb 23 14:07:18 <satcom>	is the dish moving?
Feb 23 14:07:20 <schanot>	run complete test?
Feb 23 14:07:26 <satcom>	yes
Feb 23 14:08:15 <schanot>	dish is moving
Feb 23 14:09:18 <satcom>	please let me know when it is complete. BTW, after it stows, it comes back up a few degrees and then restows
Feb 23 14:19:09 <schanot>	calibration complete
Feb 23 14:20:39 <schanot>	next?
Feb 23 14:21:28 <satcom>	now for the hard part
Feb 23 14:21:39 <schanot>	ready
Feb 23 14:22:06 <satcom>	we need to do the compass calibration...this step is critical if we are going to find the satellite
Feb 23 14:22:39 <schanot>	OK.  sounds alot like what we did the first go around
Feb 23 14:22:56 <satcom>	begin the calibration and half way through it will ask us to turn the 'vehicle' 180°
Feb 23 14:23:06 <schanot>	give us the whole string of instructions
Feb 23 14:23:40 <satcom>	when prompted to do so, move the blue box 180°. try to be precise
Feb 23 14:23:47 <lmurphy>	It should help you guys (At the Gala) to know that there are already marks on the roof to match the corners of the box
Feb 23 14:24:11 <schanot>	thanks larry
Feb 23 14:24:35 <satcom>	after turning the box 180° come back and click the next button to finish the calibration
Feb 23 14:25:05 <schanot>	working on it
Feb 23 14:27:13 <schanot>	done = we assume we now return to original position?
Feb 23 14:28:18 <satcom>	it's not neccessary
Feb 23 14:28:56 <satcom>	ok, lets click on the refresh button and see if we have any N/A's in the data on the left
Feb 23 14:29:01 <schanot>	we leave the box 180 degrees out of original ?
Feb 23 14:29:47 <satcom>	you can move it back if you want. it will take the dish a little long to find the satellite but you don't have to move it back
Feb 23 14:30:18 <schanot>	had 4 N/As to start, but only GPS altitude left
Feb 23 14:30:51 <schanot>	will it in this orientations
Feb 23 14:31:37 <satcom>	please click refresh several times
Feb 23 14:31:56 <schanot>	done
Feb 23 14:32:10 <satcom>	still NA in GPS altitude?
Feb 23 14:32:22 <schanot>	yes
Feb 23 14:32:40 <satcom>	ok...perhaps it's because you are at sea level
Feb 23 14:32:51 <satcom>	please click fin satellite
Feb 23 14:32:55 <schanot>	dish is stowed is that correct?
Feb 23 14:32:59 <satcom>	yes
Feb 23 14:33:24 <schanot>	ok
Feb 23 14:33:45 <schanot>	dish moving
Feb 23 14:34:02 <satcom>	<fingers crossed>
Feb 23 14:34:27 <satcom>	from so much typing!!
Feb 23 14:34:51 <schanot>	so much for our 20 minute task
Feb 23 14:35:06 <satcom>	quicker by phone :)
Feb 23 14:35:27 <lmurphy>	I can attest to that.
Feb 23 14:37:05 <schanot>	quality 11 strength 138
Feb 23 14:37:58 <satcom>	hasn't found the satellite yet
Feb 23 14:39:04 <schanot>	no.  kind of points toward the building now.  plan to stow and rotate 180. then repeat.
Feb 23 14:39:24 <satcom>	is the building in the way?
Feb 23 14:39:46 <schanot>	on the north side
Feb 23 14:40:09 <schanot>	away from the angle
Feb 23 14:40:13 <satcom>	won't help
Feb 23 14:40:35 <schanot>	looking above the building
Feb 23 14:41:07 <satcom>	if it is not searching in the proper direction, turning the box will not make a difference
Feb 23 14:41:52 <schanot>	what direction should it be searching we were told it needed exposure to the SE
Feb 23 14:42:05 <satcom>	true
Feb 23 14:42:31 <schanot>	that side is wide open to the ocean all the way to china
Feb 23 14:43:18 <satcom>	what is the magnetic azimuth reading in the datastorm software
Feb 23 14:44:06 <schanot>	wait one we are rerunning auto start after 180 rotation
Feb 23 14:47:21 <satcom>	should be looking almot due east
Feb 23 14:48:30 <schanot>	azimuth 156.1 sinnal now worse
Feb 23 14:49:22 <lmurphy>	FYI, the original setup had the dish pointing at 145 degrees (the southeast arrow).
Feb 23 14:50:31 <schanot>	larry - any extra cable to shift the antenna?
Feb 23 14:50:32 <satcom>	what is the elevation under satellite longitude?
Feb 23 14:51:48 <lmurphy>	we only bought the two (100') cables because we were restricted by the length of the control cable.
Feb 23 14:52:20 <schanot>	70.6
Feb 23 14:52:55 <lmurphy>	There is plenty of cable to turn the antenna (if that is what you are talking about).
Feb 23 14:53:13 <schanot>	no
Feb 23 14:53:13 <satcom>	does the elevation of the dish seem to get that high?
Feb 23 14:55:34 <schanot>	looks about right.  pointing to open sky
Feb 23 14:56:50 <satcom>	my concern is if the elevation of the datastorm is capable of pointing 70° without running out of travel
Feb 23 14:58:03 <schanot>	do you mean the software can't control at such high angles?
Feb 23 14:59:43 <schanot>	what is the general opinion.  are we finished with this test?
Feb 23 15:01:00 <satcom>	not sure if the physical properties of the dish are allowing to to get to 70°
Feb 23 15:01:51 <schanot>	we understand
Feb 23 15:02:02 <satcom>	let me make a call to MotoSat. I'll call Mike later. Sorry guys.
Feb 23 15:02:31 <daniels>	john, satmex5 does not require this, correct?
Feb 23 15:03:13 <satcom>	SatMex elevation is 54° where you are. I really think it is faulty equipment
Feb 23 15:03:25 <schanot>	thanks for the help.  we'll call it for today
Feb 23 15:03:30 <daniels>	ok, thanks
Feb 23 15:03:39 <satcom>	thanks
Feb 23 15:03:48 <daniels>	THANKS EVERYBODY!!!!!
Feb 23 15:03:58 <--	satcom has quit (CGI:IRC)
Feb 23 15:03:59 <daniels>	we'll be in email contact
Feb 23 15:04:12 <daniels>	allen, thanks a lot.  i bet you are cussing at me right now
Feb 23 15:04:50 <schanot>	OK Mike.  tomorrow is bad.  but if anything comes up, we can try somemore on Wed-Fri.
Feb 23 15:05:23 <jtanner>	exit
Feb 23 15:05:24 <daniels>	then i will look at travel issues for someone from RDP.  sounds like they will need to ship equipment this time...
Feb 23 15:05:33 <--	jtanner has quit (CGI:IRC)
Feb 23 15:05:57 <schanot>	no cussing.  i wanted to see it work.  robbie held off on lunch until 10 minutes ago
Feb 23 15:06:44 <schanot>	let's talk about further travel off line
Feb 23 15:07:01 <daniels>	ok, i will let you know what i find out from here.  pls tell Robbie thanks.  yes, we can talk offline.
Feb 23 15:07:42 <schanot>	i'm gone
Feb 23 15:07:46 <daniels>	bye
Feb 23 15:07:47 <--	daniels has quit (Leaving)
Feb 23 15:07:52 <--	schanot has quit (CGI:IRC)
Feb 23 15:12:59 <--	lmurphy has quit (Leaving)
