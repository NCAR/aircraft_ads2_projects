Feb 07 15:07:56 <hercules-c130>	How dare you all ignore me!
Feb 07 15:09:45 <hercules-c130>	To print or not to print. That is the question.
Feb 07 15:11:01 <anstett>	ask not what your sa can do for you, ask what you can do for your sa.
Feb 07 15:12:44 <hercules-c130>	Let's see. What else could you do to keep from answering my question?
Feb 07 15:13:21 <anstett>	printing - we don't do no stinking printing!  can you tell it's been a long day?
Feb 07 15:13:54 <anstett>	I could set up printing on the other laptops, but noone has ever asked for it.
Feb 07 15:14:13 <anstett>	Allen is heading to the aeropuerte.
Feb 07 15:14:58 <hercules-c130>	I don't what to hear about your long day. I have been bounced around all over this plane for the last 8 hours.
Feb 07 15:16:24 <anstett>	I set up printing once on bonnie a while ago, so it should print from bonnie.
Feb 07 15:17:52 <hercules-c130>	They are asking for it on Blanc and Bonnie. And since you took so long to answer me.... I will ask for printing on the other two.

Feb 09 11:30:07 <jbj>	G'day Al,
Feb 09 11:30:12 <schanot>	Can you get Shannon for me?  We want to know specifics on Ed Ringlemans arrival
Feb 09 11:30:15 <jbj>	At leas one thing is working
Feb 09 11:32:05 <jbj>	Shannon is not here, we will get Patsy online within a few minutes
Feb 09 11:32:49 <schanot>	Can you call Mike Daniels and get him linked up?  We have to decide about Jody
Feb 09 11:35:20 <schanot>	Ron.  Are you still there?  It looks like it
Feb 09 11:35:52 <Ron>	Allen, yes
Feb 09 11:36:01 <Ron>	I'm trying to get Patsy set up.
Feb 09 11:36:20 <schanot>	Hi Jorgen.  We are currently washing the C-130 and I can't reach the mechs
Feb 09 11:36:56 <schanot>	We will discuss shipping plans at the meeting to be held at 1300 your time
Feb 09 11:37:56 <jbj>	OK
Feb 09 11:38:14 <schanot>	we need to know arrival info on Ed Ringleman.  It chged late in the prep.  we think today.  time?
Feb 09 11:39:50 <jbj>	Al, if a truck delivers all the goods, can you store it there; i.e. by not hasving a seatainer?
Feb 09 11:41:34 -->	ruth (~8075541b@linus.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 09 11:42:09 <ruth>	Chat test from PostNuke on ron's workstation
Feb 09 11:42:25 <ruth>	OK.  Now to try Patsy's
Feb 09 11:43:24 <schanot>	yes.  we have a big space.  getting it in will be very difficult.  bad access for heavy stuff.  now lifting equipment
Feb 09 11:44:25 <schanot>	location at opposite end of airport.  it will be secure, but i'm thinking it's a bad option
Feb 09 11:46:18 <jbj>	OK, will let you know. kerry is phoning through to the Mexicans once more. It sounds like the situation is unclear - maybe the truck is already on the road in Mexico, maybe not.
Feb 09 11:46:25 <schanot>	as we continue to think, big problems moving the pieces around.  
Feb 09 11:46:43 <jbj>	Can you rent a pick-up?
Feb 09 11:48:00 <schanot>	won't help.  we are talking major hernias.  reloading at end major problem as well.  most stuff is backup and not
Feb 09 11:48:51 <schanot>	likely to be used.  We hoped not to move most pieces at all.  that was the nice thing about keeping the seatainer on truck
Feb 09 11:49:26 <jbj>	Can you rent an empty seatainer to put right outside?
Feb 09 11:50:36 <schanot>	not likely.  still have problems moviing the stuff.  best option likely return most to JeffCo and air freight key pieces

Feb 09 11:55:12 <jbj>	Hi Al,
Feb 09 11:55:36 <jbj>	is myc hat working. Last message from you detailed potential hernisa - everything later I lost.
Feb 09 11:56:59 <Ron>	Jorgen,  I've been monitoring.  No other chat.
Feb 09 11:59:04 <schanot>	this shipment of pieces will pose major problems.  that was hernias as in personal injury
Feb 09 12:01:02 <schanot>	Ron, tell Mike Daniels we have put Jody's extension on hold.  maybe have someone return later in project if part shows up
Feb 09 12:02:30 <Ron>	Allen, Will do.  He's out of town this week, so I'll tell whoever is in charge
Feb 09 12:04:25 <jbj>	I understant about hernias. Kerry is trying to find out if the shipment is already on its way. If not, then let us know what you want us to do.
Feb 09 12:05:13 <jbj>	The transfer was not authorized.
Feb 09 12:08:13 <schanot>	i'm goin g to cut chat for now.  let's get back on at 1330 your time.

Feb 09 13:03:52 <schanot>	meeting started
Feb 09 13:06:56 <jbj>	Hi Meeting here also started - Ron told me you are on, and we are awaiting news from you.
Feb 09 13:30:55 <jbj>	Any news, Al?
Feb 09 13:39:03 <schanot>	yes
Feb 09 13:39:48 <schanot>	do you have any news on where the shipment is?
Feb 09 13:40:31 <jbj>	Yes, read eamil, but right this moment I do not know if it is in the US and Mexico. repeat - delivery scheduled for Wednesday evening
Feb 09 13:41:08 <schanot>	the consencess here is we need the stuff and will deal with the consequences
Feb 09 13:41:54 <schanot>	anything new on the air freight shipment Bob Olson sent?
Feb 09 13:42:03 <jbj>	I assume)
Feb 09 13:42:24 <schanot>	what do you assume?
Feb 09 13:42:47 <jbj>	Sorry- my message scrambled. You should be able to keep box-trailer for storage where you want it.
Feb 09 13:43:19 <jbj>	Olson shipment: small box with fire detection system is caught in customs, and he may return it to here.
Feb 09 13:43:39 <jbj>	Other shipment was prepared by Shertz - have you received that?
Feb 09 13:44:16 <schanot>	no, but it takes around 7-8 days for air freight to make it through
Feb 09 13:44:31 <jbj>	OK
Feb 09 13:44:43 <jbj>	What do you want me to check from here?
Feb 09 13:45:17 <schanot>	Bob Olson had a vendor ship a fire detector to us FedEx.  No prep with Slaven.  Held for broker.  Slaven alerted. no new news
Feb 09 13:46:01 <jbj>	Yes, that is the unit Bob thinks he will have returned to jeffCo.
Feb 09 13:46:24 <jbj>	Have you read my email  regarding Wednesday delivery of large shipment?
Feb 09 13:47:17 <schanot>	no. i'll do that now.  where did shertz send the shipment?  hotel or airport?
Feb 09 13:48:43 <jbj>	Will find out about Shertz shipment.
Feb 09 13:49:48 <schanot>	problem with night time delivery.  we need this thing at the airport.  airport closed in PM after 1800 local.  need daytime even if
Feb 09 13:49:57 <schanot>	delayed another day.
Feb 09 13:50:44 <schanot>	no weather on horizon until the weekend.  Friday - Sunday look like next opportunity
Feb 09 13:50:58 <jbj>	OK, will pass message regarding airport closure to Kerry Slaven.
Feb 09 13:52:22 <jbj>	Shertz shipment is in trouble. Apparently the commercial invoice was lost, and Kerry has to create a new one. Steve assumes that it was lost by the commercial shipper.
Feb 09 13:53:35 <schanot>	I assume the box trailer is left with wheels and all.  want to bet that the stuff we don't need right away is in the front?
Feb 09 13:55:00 <jbj>	Yes, I assume so. But the order of the boxes may have been scrambled, as the Mexicans too boxes out of one seatainer and into another box-trailer.
Feb 09 13:57:43 <schanot>	it will be interesting to see how the shipping goes for NAME
Feb 09 13:58:06 <jbj>	Probably without a hitch!@#$%^*
Feb 09 13:58:33 <schanot>	the Users want us to keep Jody to get the satelite system up and running.  Mike Daniels has approved, but he needs to be
Feb 09 13:59:15 <schanot>	contacted with confirmation.  hotel is full. she may bunk of site with the SCRIPPS folks for acouple of days
Feb 09 13:59:59 <jbj>	We will contact him.
Feb 09 14:00:22 <schanot>	interesting, we never promised these guys a satelite system.  I'll be curious to see how their review of the project goes.
Feb 09 14:01:14 <jbj>	Yes - I agree.
Feb 09 14:01:25 <schanot>	we are having some problems with CO2 and the TDL.  both were noted as provisional sensors, but that won't hold water for Carl
Feb 09 14:02:11 <schanot>	sure am glad we have three!!! classic cases in hand already
Feb 09 14:02:49 <schanot>	guess we've done all we can for now.  this chat communications seems to have helped from our end
Feb 09 14:03:14 <schanot>	do you think it is too cumbersome?  
Feb 09 14:04:18 <jbj>	coffee making, etc.) , bu having Ron check it is also a great help. between us it should work well.
Feb 09 14:04:45 <jbj>	Sorry, scrambled again. Chat cannot handle backspaces. Chat is OK.
Feb 09 14:05:29 <Ron>	Chat works for me so long as I can type the characters correctly.
Feb 09 14:05:58 <jbj>	That is exactly my difficulty. Hopefully a margurita will sort that one out.
Feb 09 14:06:53 <schanot>	when you get here, i'll buy.
Feb 09 14:07:02 <jbj>	Thanx
Feb 09 14:07:36 <schanot>	Before I go, please send me your final travel arrangements via email.  I know you were moving things around
Feb 09 14:07:50 <jbj>	Will do
Feb 09 14:08:01 <schanot>	signing off
Feb 09 14:08:15 <jbj>	OK signing off - when next contact?
Feb 09 14:08:42 <schanot>	will check back tomorrow.  got a time you like?

Feb 12 09:17:14 <--	cockpit-c130 has quit ([x]chat)
Feb 12 09:18:28 <unam-c130>	It tries to.  There are 2 chat rooms, one being #C130 the other being #AIRS2.  You have to choose the #C130 one.  If I get rid of the #airs2 it will just come up to #c130.
Feb 12 09:18:41 <unam-c130>	tHIS IS jOHN btw.
Feb 12 09:19:45 <anstett>	there is an option in one of the menus to bring up the server list.  then find the syrah server and select the airs2 chat room and delete it.
Feb 12 09:21:31 <anstett>	I think the syrah server is in the list as C130 chat.

Feb 12 09:23:12 <sabl-c130>	sam says if teresa is at hotel ops center
Feb 12 09:23:39 <anstett>	do you have the server list up?  there should be a separate entry for C130 chat server.  It is a main entry, not a sub entry.
Feb 12 09:23:54 <anstett>	teresa left for the airport about 20 minutes ago.
Feb 12 09:24:12 <sabl-c130>	sam - thanks
Feb 12 09:24:49 <anstett>	There are lots of options in xchat to change almost anything.
Feb 12 09:25:06 <unam-c130>	I see that.  It is called C130 chat server.  When I click on iy I see a #airs2 channel.  Should I just delete that?  I do NOT see the #c130 channel.
Feb 12 09:25:53 <anstett>	just delete the airs2 channel and then log out and restart the xchat session to see what it does.  c130 channel can always be added again.
Feb 12 09:26:23 <unam-c130>	Okay I will give that a try.  Changing now.

Feb 13 08:20:22 <schanot>	Please repeat
Feb 13 08:21:23 <ADS-c130>	Al, i had two mess ups today.  The Radar alt was turned on 10 min late and the big pump was  30 min late.
Feb 13 08:21:54 <schanot>	ok
Feb 13 08:23:40 <ADS-c130>	Starting 5000 foot run.
Feb 13 08:24:49 <ADS-c130>	All instrument appear to be doing well.
Feb 13 08:27:23 <ADS-c130>	Al, what flow rate should the SCAI pump be set at?
Feb 13 08:28:14 <ADS-c130>	Dropping down to low level again.
Feb 13 08:30:43 <schanot>	you can leave the pump setting where it's at.
Feb 13 08:31:52 <ADS-c130>	Ok. It is running 700 to 900 lpm.
Feb 13 08:32:56 <ADS-c130>	Starting low level leg for 1 min.

Feb 13 08:45:18 <sabl-c130>	level flight - waves in boundry layer at 1538
Feb 13 08:48:01 <ADS-c130>	Al, Kip wants to send a fax back to Jeffco.  It's for Bobby.  It would be 4 pages.  It will take down this sat link until it is done.  Do you want us to wait until we get back?
Feb 13 08:48:51 <ADS-c130>	Al, Is there a Fax machine in the ops center?
Feb 13 08:49:10 <ADS-c130>	Changing track to 193
Feb 13 08:49:54 <schanot>	No FAX here.  Hotel has one
Feb 13 08:50:40 <ADS-c130>	Okay, do you wanty us to wait until we get back to use the plane or can we send it now?
Feb 13 08:50:56 <ADS-c130>	Starting to drop down to low level.
Feb 13 08:52:57 <schanot>	John,this is Larry.. You can use the regular Satcom for the Fax and not worry about breaking the Iridium link.
Feb 13 08:53:40 <ADS-c130>	You sure Larry.  We lost the link when we faxed you ion the way down, that 15 page fax.
Feb 13 08:54:30 <ADS-c130>	Well, I say we give it a try so that we know in the future.
Feb 13 08:55:27 <schanot>	OK, If you already know that we lost data during that fax then it will probably happen again but this is the first that I have heard of that.
Feb 13 08:55:30 <ADS-c130>	Starting low level run.
Feb 13 08:56:32 <ADS-c130>	Ok, well lets try it again.  Maybe I was attributing it to the fax and it was not that.
Feb 13 08:57:04 <ADS-c130>	Climbing and changing track to 188.
Feb 13 08:57:36 <schanot>	So I guess that you just wait to send the fax, Al says.
Feb 13 08:58:58 <ADS-c130>	Ok.  I guess we will wait then.  If they lever the INS up we can do it from the ramp when we get back. Or Kip said he can send it from the hotel.
Feb 13 08:59:19 <schanot>	That would be best - Al
Feb 13 08:59:47 <ADS-c130>	I will pass that on to Kip then.
Feb 13 09:02:17 <ADS-c130>	We will do it from the ramp when we get back.  We will leave the ins up. Do we want to leave the data system up so we can test and see if it is effected?

Feb 13 09:20:41 <ADS-c130>	Al nay update on the position of the Jet?
Feb 13 09:21:04 <schanot>	Looks like a decent case, if not spectacular.  give us a warning if your eta changes from 1400 Local
Feb 13 09:21:35 <schanot>	I'll see if quikscat has a new update
Feb 13 09:22:28 <ADS-c130>	Not yet.  We are shifting track to see if we can find the jet down here.  The waves have stopped and they are looking for a place to do the cross wind legs at.
Feb 13 09:22:48 <ADS-c130>	Thanks for checking quickscat.
Feb 13 09:27:25 <schanot>	nothing new on quikscat.  no good coverage of the target area since previous plot
Feb 13 09:27:50 <ADS-c130>	Ok, thanks for looking.
Feb 13 09:29:54 <schanot>	if the case is looking marginal, maybe they could throw in a reverse track transect at the same altitude for winds QA

Feb 13 09:35:56 <schanot>	either is fine if they fly it as a reverse heading and let the plane drift.  Altitude not that important.  maybe on of your mid altitude
Feb 13 09:35:59 <schanot>	transects

Feb 13 10:32:41 <daniels>	OK.  I can't remember if I told you or not but I did have success using my GSM phone down in Mazatlan.  BB is planning to try a GSM phone in Antigua.
Feb 13 10:33:36 <daniels>	Jody: office moves are happening as planned.  You should be able to have a nice window when you get back!
Feb 13 10:33:53 <schanot>	any news on getting a broker for the NAME shipment into Mexico?  I don't think they can afford the delay of the ransom.
Feb 13 10:33:56 <ADS-c130>	Starting 1000 leg.
Feb 13 10:34:34 <daniels>	I know they are discussing the NAME shipment alot right now.  They are looking at a different entry point into Mexico the last I heard.
Feb 13 10:34:59 <daniels>	We had a RICO meeting yesterday.  New option for places to stay on Antigua.
Feb 13 10:35:28 <schanot>	I'll leave that in Jorgen's hands
Feb 13 10:35:42 <daniels>	Two bedroom villas, but at $200/night they request that people double up.  From the pictures, these are very. very nice though.
Feb 13 10:36:09 <daniels>	yes, jorgen was also there.
Feb 13 10:36:20 <schanot>	ahoy C-130.  Still on the planned schedule?
Feb 13 10:38:48 <ADS-c130>	Not sure.  It looks like me might be able to fly into that restricted zone so that might change things up a bit.
Feb 13 10:39:22 <ADS-c130>	Completed 1000 run setting up for 5000 then moving to stack A I think.
Feb 13 10:39:46 <schanot>	roger that/  we plan to head for the airport around 1300 local.  let us know if you plan on stretching things out/
Feb 13 10:40:12 <ADS-c130>	The Commander of that airbase is onboard today.
Feb 13 10:40:36 <ADS-c130>	I will once we have an idea.  I think we ar 
Feb 13 10:40:55 <schanot>	it's always who you know!
Feb 13 10:40:56 <ADS-c130>	I think we are running a bit ahead right now but I'm not sure.
Feb 13 10:41:53 <ADS-c130>	Aint that the truth.  He comes back here, wants to see the restricted zone they say that if we want we can go into it today.
Feb 13 10:42:46 <ADS-c130>	They gave him a hat maybe that helped out <g>.
Feb 13 10:44:18 <ADS-c130>	Ken will give me an update on the time here in a bit.  He understands about letting you know before you leave the hotel.
Feb 13 10:46:03 <bruce>	Mike, any changes in the marine bl depth does it still look shallow compared to previous flights?

Feb 13 10:47:24 <daniels>	Jody: can you type "/query daniels" and click on the tab?
Feb 13 10:51:01 <sabl-c130>	looking down from 5000ft , hard to tell, been about 300-500m today
Feb 13 10:55:39 <ADS-c130>	Daniels, what does that do?
Feb 13 10:56:32 <daniels>	it's a way to bring up a separate chat channel for a two-way discussion.  there are a whole bunch of IRC commands and options, but I just haven't had time to describe all of them yet...
Feb 13 10:56:51 <daniels>	but query is a way to set up a two way conversation...
Feb 13 10:57:08 <djamal-c130>	Actually the mexican air force guy onboard said he is the 2nd commander of that base 
Feb 13 10:58:38 <ADS-c130>	Okay, so it is like a second chat area but just for two people.
Feb 13 10:59:06 <daniels>	yes, that's right.  it can come in handy so as not to clog up this channel...
Feb 13 10:59:56 <schanot>	yeah .. and you certainly are a BIG clog
Feb 13 11:00:45 <ADS-c130>	Looks like we will be done and landing about 1350 to 1400L.  They are going to try and do a reverse heading for you Al.
Feb 13 11:01:51 <schanot>	roger that.  we'll see you then

Feb 13 11:05:16 <daniels>	If I'm a big clog, then you are a tall skinny clog
Feb 13 11:05:33 <daniels>	this will have to be edited out of the logs - ha
Feb 13 11:05:56 <ADS-c130>	Mike D. is there a site that has all the chat commands?
Feb 13 11:06:17 <daniels>	you can do a google search for "IRC commands" and there are lots of them
Feb 13 11:06:20 <schanot>	they've got to let you have alittle fun when you're doing this kind of work.
Feb 13 11:06:23 <ADS-c130>	Doing 1000 leg.
Feb 13 11:06:41 <ADS-c130>	Wait not in a leg yet.
Feb 13 11:06:46 <daniels>	the chat server we are using is just a standard irc server so most every command should work
Feb 13 11:07:07 <ADS-c130>	Hey I think this is great.  It keeps me from getting sleepy.
Feb 13 11:07:36 <ADS-c130>	I think I will try and get a set of caommands for the plane.
Feb 13 11:07:42 <daniels>	another thing that may help in some occasions is creating another chat channel, like what the dropsonde guys did in BAMEX
Feb 13 11:08:40 <ADS-c130>	It might, but we are not doing much with this yet.  They are using the i cs a lot this time though.
Feb 13 11:08:40 <Ron>	What, edit chat.  I can't do that!
Feb 13 11:09:24 <ADS-c130>	Ohhh and here I thought Ron was just a logger bot.  Oopss is a real OP.
Feb 13 11:09:46 <Ron>	I wear two hats.
Feb 13 11:09:59 <daniels>	I'm sure that was really an automated response
Feb 13 11:10:05 <daniels>	it comes out every hour or so
Feb 13 11:10:43 <ADS-c130>	And you wear them very well.
Feb 13 11:10:43 <ADS-c130>	Starting 3000 run now.
Feb 13 11:11:55 <schanot>	with all this banter, you'd fit right in with this crew, mike.  Are you auditioning?
Feb 13 11:12:29 <daniels>	yes, i want all of my responses in the chat log to be meaningless dribble
Feb 13 11:12:58 <ADS-c130>	Yeah, he is trying out for the RICO crew.  But getting him to say Cleveland would be tought <g>.
Feb 13 11:13:32 <daniels>	i was in Cleveland!!
Feb 13 11:14:14 <daniels>	ok, but only for three days
Feb 13 11:14:19 <ADS-c130>	HMM, I don't seem to remember that.  I guess my brain is still thawing out.
Feb 13 11:14:48 <ADS-c130>	Dripping lots of condensation on this flight.
Feb 13 11:15:55 <ADS-c130>	Dropping to 1000.
Feb 13 11:19:07 <schanot>	why are you snaking around on the northerly leg?
Feb 13 11:19:40 <ADS-c130>	Corrwecting for drift I think.
Feb 13 11:20:14 <ADS-c130>	There is a lot of confusion today.
Feb 13 11:20:41 <schanot>	it is definitely more humid today.  we saw contrails off your props when you took off.
Feb 13 11:21:36 <schanot>	i'll check quikscan again
Feb 13 11:21:39 <ADS-c130>	That is always a neat sight.
Feb 13 11:21:47 <ADS-c130>	Turning to start cross wind legs at 1000.
Feb 13 11:23:55 <bruce>	Mike S.  Any last comments before we head out to the airport?
Feb 13 11:24:33 <ADS-c130>	Looking to do legs at 500, 300, 200, 100 then to 3000.
Feb 13 11:24:44 <sabl-c130>	see you soon
Feb 13 11:24:50 <ADS-c130>	Al do you want just a reverse heading manuver?
Feb 13 11:26:12 <--	bruce has quit (CGI:IRC (EOF))
Feb 13 11:26:14 <schanot>	that is my primary concern.  usually not much change in pitch and sideslip.  just a RH would be fine this time
Feb 13 11:27:03 <ADS-c130>	Ok, I will pass that on the the flight crew. Will 3000 be a got altitude for you?
Feb 13 11:27:17 <ADS-c130>	End of run dropping to 500.
Feb 13 11:28:39 <schanot>	3000 is fine.  staying in the range of the NASA scanner, 1200 ft?, would also work.
Feb 13 11:29:18 <ADS-c130>	Ok, I will give them that option. Thanks Al.
Feb 13 11:31:34 <ADS-c130>	Al, do you want 2 or 4 minute legs on the RH?

Feb 13 11:32:48 <daniels>	whoops.  hey, did i miss something or does ION automatically refresh its display now?
Feb 13 11:33:12 <schanot>	how about four minute legs for good statistics
Feb 13 11:33:35 <ADS-c130>	We will do 4 min legs then.
Feb 13 11:33:55 <schanot>	no Mike.  what are you smoking?
Feb 13 11:34:25 <daniels>	can't say.  I thought this green part of the flight track was something new...
Feb 13 11:35:18 <daniels>	well, anyway, nice chatting with you all.  Pls let me know how the satellite setup is going!  adios!
Feb 13 11:35:34 <ADS-c130>	That is new it is the last 5 minutes of data.  It still needs to be manually refreshed though.
Feb 13 11:36:16 <ADS-c130>	Janet did that in AIRS because we could not tell where the plane was as it flew over old tracks.  Nice feature yes?
Feb 13 11:36:28 <daniels>	yes, nice feature!

Feb 13 11:45:25 <ADS-c130>	Ron, is the chat log an ASCII file? Do the researchers have access after the project to them?
Feb 13 11:46:12 <ADS-c130>	Okay Al.  We will see you when we land.
Feb 13 11:47:07 <Ron>	Chat log is an ASCII file.  I have yet to split it up into dated files.  I can do that sometime today and add an OW web page for viewing.  There is an editing issue if they are world readable.
Feb 13 11:48:09 <ADS-c130>	I think they are looking to use it for event markers.  I try to keep it clean enough for the world to read <grin>.

Feb 13 12:19:34 <ADS-c130>	That's okay.  I was not sure what the problem was but a bunch of replys would make sure you saw one of them.  We had a good laugh up here over it <g>.

Feb 18 10:13:19 -->	You are now talking on #C130Q
Feb 18 10:25:58 -->	bruce (~80754e6d@linus.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 18 10:30:41 <Ron>	Bruce, do you know whether they are still flying?
Feb 18 10:31:17 <bruce>	Ron, I don't.  I am at foothills
Feb 18 10:31:42 <Ron>	Thanks.  I'm at Jeffco.
Feb 18 10:51:29 -->	jtanner (~80755465@linus.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 18 10:55:02 <Ron>	Jody, nothing's happening.  Just Bruce and I here in town.
Feb 18 11:18:47 <--	jtanner has quit (CGI:IRC)
Feb 18 11:40:39 -->	schanot (~c8410021@linus.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 18 12:00:17 <bruce>	Al,  any C130 news?
Feb 18 12:30:33 -->	jtanner (~80755465@linus.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 18 12:33:00 <jtanner>	hi - who's there?
Feb 18 12:34:34 <bruce>	I am still watching but it is very quiet today.
Feb 18 12:35:48 <jtanner>	i heard the plane couldn't fly today.  What happened?
Feb 18 12:40:05 <bruce>	I haven't heard anything.
Feb 18 12:56:08 <Ron>	Allen, wassup?
Feb 18 12:58:38 <schanot>	hello everyone.  welcome to the show!
Feb 18 12:59:16 <schanot>	today's flight was cancelled one hour in due to an engine problem.
Feb 18 12:59:57 <schanot>	all better now.  we're ready to start the 1400 briefing so i'll be in and out for a while
Feb 18 13:00:21 <schanot>	Jody - did you check your email?  is Mike D. around?
Feb 18 13:01:19 <jtanner>	I did check email.  I'm at Jeffco and can't reach Mike via phone
Feb 18 13:01:42 <schanot>	any comment on the satelite issue?
Feb 18 13:02:48 <jtanner>	I just called Mike on his cell.  he'll get on-line shortly
Feb 18 13:03:09 <jtanner>	it sounds like the satellite was working until Rob changed something. 
Feb 18 13:03:18 <jtanner>	do you know what he changed.  is he around to ask?
Feb 18 13:06:07 -->	daniels (~daniels@atd-trout.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 18 13:06:13 <daniels>	wasssssup
Feb 18 13:08:13 <jtanner>	hey mike.  sounds like the satellite dish won't stay locked onto the satellite. 
Feb 18 13:08:27 <daniels>	just read allens message.  is brandon around, too?
Feb 18 13:09:28 <daniels>	ive got another meeting at 130...  will people be here soon?
Feb 18 13:09:57 <daniels>	i can reschedule it for 1/2 hour later if that helps
Feb 18 13:10:02 <jtanner>	Allen is on-line.  
Feb 18 13:10:18 <daniels>	why is he so quiet?
Feb 18 13:10:31 <jtanner>	Allen, is Rob around?  Also, do you know who Larry talked to at SkyCasters?
Feb 18 13:12:06 <jtanner>	maybe they're busy 
Feb 18 13:12:43 <jtanner>	so, if the company admits that there is a problem with the satellite,
Feb 18 13:12:50 <jtanner>	then should we just have them forget about it?
Feb 18 13:12:57 <daniels>	brandon is here in my office, just a sec...
Feb 18 13:13:10 <schanot>	hold on, meeting continues
Feb 18 13:13:25 <daniels>	what meeting?
Feb 18 13:16:11 <daniels>	we need to know who was contacted from skycasters
Feb 18 13:18:06 <daniels>	brandon will contact the skycasters sales rep while we wait for your meeting to finish
Feb 18 13:18:25 <daniels>	i would lake a complete rundown of what has been done so far and by whom
Feb 18 13:20:00 <daniels>	my other meeting has been moved to 230
Feb 18 13:20:53 <jtanner>	yesterday Joe and I chatted with Al and Larry.  We asked them to change some settings
Feb 18 13:21:28 <jtanner>	we never heard back if our changes were successful.  I doubt they were.  So I can tell them what to change back.
Feb 18 13:22:07 <daniels>	i am trying to get brandon on chat...
Feb 18 13:22:44 <schanot>	OK meeting finished
Feb 18 13:22:44 <--	jtanner has quit (CGI:IRC (EOF))
Feb 18 13:22:46 -->	jtanner (~80755465@linus.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 18 13:23:20 <daniels>	just a sec
Feb 18 13:25:10 <schanot>	Tech support at skycasters has been contacted numerous times, Larry has talked to Robert, Todd, Gary and Jeremy to name a few.
Feb 18 13:26:37 <schanot>	It has been determined by Tech Support and Larry that their Sat coverage here in Mexico is not sufficient enough to keep a reliable signal.
Feb 18 13:26:54 <daniels>	who in tech support?
Feb 18 13:27:44 <jtanner>	also, did anyone communicate to skycasters via email?
Feb 18 13:29:12 <--	bruce has quit (CGI:IRC)
Feb 18 13:29:19 <schanot>	No to e-mail. Much time has been spent working with the system and tech support simultaneously.
Feb 18 13:30:07 ---	schanot is now known as Larry
Feb 18 13:31:05 <jtanner>	hi larry. 
Feb 18 13:31:11 <daniels>	hi larry.  brandon said that he specifically asked them the question about coverage in mexico.  so we need to know who from skycasters said it was not available
Feb 18 13:31:34 <Larry>	Look at the skycastrers website for coverage of the SatMex5 satellite.
Feb 18 13:32:59 <jtanner>	huatulco looks like it's on the edge of that coverage.  is that what you see too?
Feb 18 13:33:12 <jtanner>	Mike, the page is http://www.skycasters.com/satellite-internet-coverage/index.html
Feb 18 13:33:17 <Larry>	Gary was the last person that I dicussed our situation with. He did not say that it was not avail. Only that it probably not be reliable enough for us to use.
Feb 18 13:34:55 <Larry>	I did much testing and tweaking with the system and had it working several times only to come back later and it would not be working.
Feb 18 13:35:26 -->	brandon (~80755039@linus.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 18 13:35:38 <daniels>	hi brandon
Feb 18 13:35:43 <brandon>	Hello
Feb 18 13:36:06 <daniels>	were you able to contact skycasters?
Feb 18 13:36:24 <brandon>	Calling now.
Feb 18 13:36:30 <Larry>	The system tests is TX on a regular basis. If it determines that it;s signal is not good enough it shuts itself down,
Feb 18 13:38:09 <brandon>	Who at Skycasters have we been talking to?
Feb 18 13:38:12 <daniels>	brandon, just a recap.  larry heard from a tech support person (gary) that the satellite signal is too weak to be reliable
Feb 18 13:39:32 <brandon>	I am talking to Anne Salmon at Skycasters now.  She is our Account Executive.
Feb 18 13:40:22 <daniels>	let's first ask them about the coverage in huatulco
Feb 18 13:40:59 <daniels>	then ask them about the behavior larry describes, i.e. shutting down on a weak signal - is there a way to disable this?
Feb 18 13:41:17 <brandon>	She is checking her coverage map now,  she was sure she had checked it before.
Feb 18 13:41:36 <daniels>	Larry/Jody at this point how confident are we that the system is configured properly?
Feb 18 13:41:42 <Larry>	Tech support ar skycasters is 757-306-4910. Hit 1 several times and then wait for a human to answer
Feb 18 13:42:49 <brandon>	Anne is going to walk down the hall and talk to Gary.  She says that this same dish has worked in Guatamala, which is south of you.
Feb 18 13:43:04 <jtanner>	I asked them to make some changes yesterday.
Feb 18 13:43:08 <Larry>	Basically we only ever got it to work, stand alone, not as a server.  and only for short intervals in that mode.
Feb 18 13:43:10 <jtanner>	I think those changes are incorrect
Feb 18 13:43:42 <daniels>	i asked ron to create an chat account so perhaps the skycasters tech support can join in...
Feb 18 13:44:04 <Larry>	drop the networking.  we are talking satelite performance, specifically.
Feb 18 13:44:46 <daniels>	jody: where these network settings?
Feb 18 13:45:06 <brandon>	Anne is going to talk to Gary.  I have given them the URL and the satcom login information that Ron set up.
Feb 18 13:45:14 <jtanner>	we had them change the 2nd ethernet adapter gateway settings.
Feb 18 13:45:19 <jtanner>	remember that larry?
Feb 18 13:45:36 <Larry>	the network discussion is irrelavant at this point.  The satelite won't support reliable contact.
Feb 18 13:45:58 ---	Larry is now known as allen
Feb 18 13:47:09 <daniels>	and so signal strength/satellite lock is based on some sort of status light or other indication?
Feb 18 13:47:49 <allen>	The unit down in Guatamala could be on a different satelite which we cannot receive without brand new arrangements
Feb 18 13:48:27 <allen>	si.  which will not stay above nominal levels
Feb 18 13:49:31 <daniels>	so it's a red-yellow-green indicator or LED bars or something?
Feb 18 13:49:51 <allen>	digital meter
Feb 18 13:49:57 <daniels>	ok
Feb 18 13:50:17 <daniels>	and are there settings on the steering unit that are user configurable?
Feb 18 13:50:17 <--	brandon has quit (CGI:IRC (EOF))
Feb 18 13:50:33 -->	brandon (~80755039@linus.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 18 13:50:48 <allen>	yes and those have been tweaked many times and in small increments
Feb 18 13:51:01 <daniels>	and how confident are we that they are now correct?
Feb 18 13:51:51 <jtanner>	with the changes that Joe and I asked them to do yesterday, I'm not confident.
Feb 18 13:51:54 <allen>	Very!
Feb 18 13:52:35 <daniels>	jody: as Larry mentioned, were these changes in the settings of the steering unit?
Feb 18 13:52:41 <allen>	Those settings have nothing to do with the operation of the SaT itself,
Feb 18 13:53:39 <daniels>	brandon" any luck with skycasters tech support on chat?
Feb 18 13:54:03 <--	jtanner has quit (CGI:IRC)
Feb 18 13:54:04 <allen>	Jody is talking software and IP settings.  We are talking straight satelite ops
Feb 18 13:54:30 <daniels>	i understand that.  sorry i have to ask redundant questions - i'm just trying to get up to speed
Feb 18 13:54:44 <brandon>	Regaurdless of changes made to knobs and meters and such, this is supposed to be "very user friendly" to set up.  Plug in cables, turn it on and select "Auto Deployment"
Feb 18 13:55:02 <daniels>	then i wonder why we had to change the seetings in the first place?
Feb 18 13:55:05 <brandon>	It sounds as if that is not the case in this instance.
Feb 18 13:55:31 <brandon>	Anne is off talking to Gary, I gave them the info.
Feb 18 13:55:46 <daniels>	ok
Feb 18 13:56:08 <allen>	it is not auto down here.  We did all of this work in direct contact with skycatsers.  
Feb 18 13:56:14 -->	jtanner (~80755465@linus.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 18 13:56:38 <daniels>	So auto was tried and did not work?
Feb 18 13:57:40 <allen>	we started with auto as the instructions said.  we moved on with skycasters to at least get a lock.
Feb 18 13:58:32 <daniels>	did we get different settings from each of the skycasters tech support folks?
Feb 18 13:58:55 <allen>	it took alot of fine adjustment.  many system calibrations... particularly on dish pointing controls
Feb 18 13:59:43 <allen>	we worked through all of them via tech support and got a connection.  we moved on to work with Jody to use as server.
Feb 18 14:00:28 <allen>	hoped to make it work today, but the satelite keeps dropping the lock.  not much use working on the server part if it won't hold lock.
Feb 18 14:00:50 <daniels>	and when the connection drops, the unit shuts down and does not automatically restart?
Feb 18 14:01:26 <allen>	correcto
Feb 18 14:02:13 <daniels>	any feel for how often the link drops?  e.g. does it stay up for 30 min then drop, 1 hour, etc.?
Feb 18 14:02:45 <allen>	from tests run- 5 minutes average between drops
Feb 18 14:03:10 <daniels>	and the length of the drop?
Feb 18 14:03:41 <daniels>	i.e. does it usually lock again once restarted?
Feb 18 14:04:20 <allen>	it doesn't restart. so where are you going?  seems to be somewhat weather dependent.... winds, clouds, etc
Feb 18 14:04:37 <daniels>	i mean once you manually restart
Feb 18 14:05:06 <allen>	when restarted manually. sometimes yes, sometimes no.
Feb 18 14:05:06 <daniels>	i just wonder if there is a way to disable the shutdown and have it keep retrying
Feb 18 14:06:30 <allen>	much of my expertise leaves tomorrow.  we are going to terminate further action on the satelite unless you guys want to take it further
Feb 18 14:06:30 <daniels>	there is software called ofps (or something like that) that can failover to another link if the main one should drop
Feb 18 14:07:26 <daniels>	i for one would like to discuss things with tech support.  this could be a contractual issue and if it does not work as advertised and promised we need a refund
Feb 18 14:09:00 <allen>	we are beyond things that we can work on.  I don't have more project cash to throw at this.  do you want to fund something further/
Feb 18 14:09:32 <daniels>	we've got TONS of cash
Feb 18 14:09:33 <daniels>	(jk)
Feb 18 14:09:57 <daniels>	but, seriously, working with the system and trying it out is very important to us for other projects
Feb 18 14:09:57 <allen>	i know you're broke.  what about some RICO cash?
Feb 18 14:10:16 <daniels>	in other words i'm sure we could fund a trip
Feb 18 14:10:43 <daniels>	but we wouldn't have needed to do this if these problems occured in feb 2nd when the shipment was due!!!!!!!
Feb 18 14:11:13 <daniels>	so hoe many hours are left
Feb 18 14:11:54 <allen>	technical problems would have been the same.  
Feb 18 14:12:23 <allen>	we are roughly half way through, flight hours and time in the field
Feb 18 14:12:25 <daniels>	but we would have lots of knowledgeable people and expertise for quite a while!?!?!
Feb 18 14:12:34 <daniels>	anyway, water under the bridge
Feb 18 14:12:50 <allen>	yes.  what now?
Feb 18 14:13:08 <daniels>	again, i would still like to talk to tech support to see how feasible a fix is --- brandon, is gary coming online?
Feb 18 14:13:59 <allen>	I need some lunch.  back in 20 minutes?
Feb 18 14:14:21 <allen>	will give you guys time to talk to the tech reps
Feb 18 14:14:27 <daniels>	i have ameeting at 230, so i will try to just talk to tech support. thx
Feb 18 14:15:13 <allen>	try and talk directly to Gary.  you will get a filtered version from the sales rep.
Feb 18 14:17:27 <daniels>	anyone in huatulco?  we are having them set up a conference call with us
Feb 18 14:19:29 -->	satcom (~8075503c@linus.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 18 14:19:34 <satcom>	test
Feb 18 14:21:09 <satcom>	this is mike
Feb 18 14:21:16 <--	satcom has quit (CGI:IRC 0.5.2)
Feb 18 14:21:56 <daniels>	anyone in huatulco
Feb 18 14:21:58 <daniels>	?
Feb 18 14:22:00 <brandon>	We are going to be talking with John Baker, their Fullfillment Manager at 800.268.8594 x209
Feb 18 14:26:00 <allen>	i'm still here.
Feb 18 14:26:25 <allen>	larry left for food
Feb 18 14:28:15 <daniels>	i have the number for someone at skycasters
Feb 18 14:28:27 <daniels>	what is the signal strength?
Feb 18 14:28:40 <daniels>	are there any radars or radar detectors around?
Feb 18 14:28:41 <allen>	larry knows.  not here
Feb 18 14:29:02 <daniels>	from my discussion with him, there is no problem with the coverage in that area
Feb 18 14:29:07 <allen>	no. we are on the roof with a clear field of view to the SE
Feb 18 14:29:17 <daniels>	he is curious as to why the settings had to be changed
Feb 18 14:29:34 <daniels>	i know you've explained all this before---
Feb 18 14:30:05 <daniels>	but he said he has lots of experience with these units and is the person our account representative recommends
Feb 18 14:30:28 <allen>	he should talk to Gary.  everyone is confusing the issue.  the settings changed did not have anything to do with the lock.
Feb 18 14:31:09 <daniels>	when will larry be back?  was anyone else involved?
Feb 18 14:31:10 <allen>	LArry worked with gary each step of the way.
Feb 18 14:31:41 <allen>	john cowan was working on it too.  he is back in Denver
Feb 18 14:32:03 <daniels>	i understand and this is not intended to question larry
Feb 18 14:32:48 <daniels>	this guy was just very surprised that any of these setting had to be changed
Feb 18 14:33:15 <daniels>	i mentioned the dish pointing controls
Feb 18 14:33:28 <daniels>	which is what you said in your message
Feb 18 14:34:43 <allen>	it would not lock on automatically.  we had to run various calibration tests on the system
Feb 18 14:35:16 <allen>	finally tweaked it to the pooint where it would lock on.
Feb 18 14:35:56 <daniels>	he said that at one point you were receiving a signal strength of 88?
Feb 18 14:35:56 <allen>	started working on the interface with the data center.  thought things were good.
Feb 18 14:36:27 <allen>	i believe that is correct.  we are looking for larry now.
Feb 18 14:38:12 <daniels>	btw, I think it will be important to document everything -- contracts may need this
Feb 18 14:43:11 <--	jtanner has quit (CGI:IRC)
Feb 18 14:43:37 <daniels>	allen, can i get a phone number for you down there?  I'm going to call them and then try and do a conference call w/Larry

Feb 18 14:52:41 <allen>	we're looking for larry.  i'm not sure how the call gets us any further.
Feb 18 14:53:23 <daniels>	it just covers us in case we need to get our money back
Feb 18 14:54:29 <allen>	OK.  All details were verbal over the phone.  We will write a report documenting our actions and the communications.
Feb 18 14:54:50 <allen>	Could come down to he said / she said
Feb 18 14:55:18 <daniels>	what is you #?
Feb 18 14:55:29 <daniels>	you=your

Feb 18 14:56:18 <allen>	Use 011 52 958-589-3430  ... that is the cell phone in the data center.  best wait for larry. 
Feb 18 14:56:20 <daniels>	the guy we need to talk to is on the east coast and he leaves the office 6pm eastern
Feb 18 14:56:33 <allen>	working on it
Feb 18 14:56:35 <daniels>	ok, i will wait for larry
Feb 18 14:56:55 <allen>	what happened to your meeting/
Feb 18 14:57:10 <daniels>	i moved it again
Feb 18 14:57:23 <daniels>	it was just between me and santiago
Feb 18 14:57:36 <allen>	86 bucks a day and I get 2 bananas and and apple for lunch
Feb 18 14:57:51 <daniels>	really? how come?
Feb 18 14:57:55 <daniels>	you were late?
Feb 18 14:58:16 <allen>	talking to you guys.
Feb 18 14:58:49 <daniels>	ok, i guess i "owe" you a philly cheese
Feb 18 14:59:13 <allen>	we have located larry.  will be here is 15 minutes.
Feb 18 14:59:34 <daniels>	ok, i will plan to get this guy and him on the phone.
Feb 18 15:00:55 <--	brandon has quit (CGI:IRC)
Feb 18 15:02:13 <daniels>	btw, rdp will be paying for this call out of THEIR BUDGET so don't ever say we didn't help you guys ;-)  talk all you want on our nickel
Feb 18 15:04:51 <allen>	it cost me money to receive incoming international calls on my cell phones
Feb 18 15:06:24 <daniels>	what sort of goofy plan did you get then?  you can get one that allows free incoming calls?  Also, do you have a landline?
Feb 18 15:07:40 <allen>	we have larry here now.  he's dripping on me
Feb 18 15:08:33 <allen>	if you want to try and reach me via the hotel system.  Be my guest.  abla espanjol
Feb 18 15:14:25 <allen>	ping 192.168.1.15
Feb 18 15:16:18 <daniels>	just a sec
Feb 18 15:16:49 <daniels>	you can't ping that address except from within your network, silly
Feb 18 15:17:03 <daniels>	that's what is known as a "private" ip address
Feb 18 15:17:17 <allen>	operator error
Feb 18 15:17:45 <allen>	slow link.  henry transfering imaging
Feb 18 15:17:54 <daniels>	however, if you ssh to linus i can grab your ip address from your login record
Feb 18 15:18:23 <allen>	please make call now.  larry here
Feb 18 15:18:38 <daniels>	john is away from his desk!
Feb 18 15:19:34 <daniels>	can someone ssh to linus.atd.ucar.edu
Feb 18 15:19:51 <allen>	why
Feb 18 15:20:18 <daniels>	you are connected via phone now, right?
Feb 18 15:20:31 <Ron>	Mike, I assume you mean someone from Huatulco is to ssh to linus.
Feb 18 15:20:35 <allen>	yes. dial up modem
Feb 18 15:21:04 <daniels>	Ron: yes, but then I checkedc and a few people had already connected.  i have their ip adress now
Feb 18 15:27:02 <allen>	we still working on this?
Feb 18 15:27:20 <daniels>	yes.  no answer from the guy.  need to try again in 5 min
Feb 18 15:28:20 <allen>	one more try. then have to wait for Larry's return to JeffCO
Feb 18 15:28:45 <daniels>	agreed
Feb 18 15:28:58 <allen>	we had an early start.... our fun meters are pegged
Feb 18 15:29:51 <daniels>	is there some sort of status page or whatever that describes the current settings?  might be handy to have this
Feb 18 15:31:51 <allen>	no.  on start up it would not take a Mexican zip code.  we had to initialize with lat and lon
Feb 18 15:32:31 <daniels>	so there was no built in gps i take it
Feb 18 15:33:18 <allen>	there is.  we don't know why it asks its location.  just does
Feb 18 15:36:51 <allen>	are we done here?
Feb 18 15:37:26 <daniels>	when does larry come back?
Feb 18 15:37:52 <daniels>	who is his replacement and has he been briefed?
Feb 18 15:38:48 <allen>	no one with his expertise.  really hands on training.  we are toast when he goes unless you want to send someone.
Feb 18 15:39:41 <allen>	larry leaves tomoorow morning.  already extended him once.
Feb 18 15:39:47 <daniels>	i won't send anyone until if/when i know there is a chance to fix it. 
Feb 18 15:39:59 <daniels>	then i guess we are done for now
Feb 18 15:41:00 <allen>	sounds right to me.  we have a flight scheduled for tomorrow if he wants to chat some more.

Feb 19 13:15:41 <sabl-c130>	We have been flying low most of the day.
Feb 19 13:41:36 <schanot>	yo kurt.  any update on your eta?  still 1600 local?
Feb 19 13:44:51 <daniels>	more satcom updates
Feb 19 13:45:06 <daniels>	skycasters said they are working on a software fix
Feb 19 13:45:27 <daniels>	this would allow the system to communicate w/ a different satellite
Feb 19 13:45:42 <daniels>	install would be a modem download and would take 30 min to 1 hour
Feb 19 13:45:54 <daniels>	they want to do this before sending any hardware
Feb 19 13:46:05 <daniels>	therefore, brandon is on hold until further notice

Feb 19 13:50:58 <schanot>	sounds good sabl.  can you guys get us an eta for the airport?
Feb 19 13:52:18 <schanot>	mike daniels - how/who is going to make that work

Feb 19 13:59:12 <daniels>	allen: skycasters will contact us when the software update is ready.  they are testing it.  then, someone down there will have to download and install it on the satcom laptop.
Feb 19 14:00:00 <schanot>	and you are thinking of me?  i'm barely computer literate!
Feb 19 14:00:56 <schanot>	i think we can get sufficient help from some of the Users.

Feb 23 07:40:42 <daniels>	hello
Feb 23 07:40:50 <daniels>	i've been waiting...
Feb 23 07:41:19 <schanot>	welcome my friend to the show that never ends!
Feb 23 07:41:31 <daniels>	i'm so very happy to be here
Feb 23 07:41:34 <daniels>	ha
Feb 23 07:41:56 <daniels>	what time do you want to get started?
Feb 23 07:42:00 <schanot>	OK.  I emailed Baker asking him to set a schedule for today.  nothing back from him yet
Feb 23 07:42:22 <daniels>	you have to call his cellphone -- he was not in the office over the weekend
Feb 23 07:42:31 <daniels>	he was willing to do this from home
Feb 23 07:42:53 <daniels>	i can try to call if you are ready
Feb 23 07:43:12 <schanot>	I understood that.  I indicated a potential problem on the Hughes end of things
Feb 23 07:43:28 <daniels>	what do you mean?
Feb 23 07:44:19 <schanot>	Baker said that it sometimes takes Hughes awhile to coordinate this kind of change in satelite
Feb 23 07:44:39 <daniels>	so you already talked to him?
Feb 23 07:44:58 <schanot>	this was from an email he sent to me on Friday
Feb 23 07:45:09 <daniels>	ok. got it.
Feb 23 07:45:29 <schanot>	i figured we could hit it hard today while we were all on station
Feb 23 07:45:30 <daniels>	when i talked to him on the phone he said this procedure should not take long at all
Feb 23 07:45:57 <daniels>	he said 10-15 minutes for the connection and then a few minutes for offline configuration
Feb 23 07:46:07 <schanot>	so, the gist is that we need to hook the satelite laptop to a modem line, right?
Feb 23 07:46:10 <daniels>	i just used 1 hour as the worst case
Feb 23 07:46:16 <daniels>	that is my understanding
Feb 23 07:46:33 <daniels>	he said he needs to do some sort of configuration from that laptop
Feb 23 07:46:39 <schanot>	should we just hook into one of the unused lines Jody set up here?
Feb 23 07:46:45 <daniels>	yes
Feb 23 07:47:28 <daniels>	who will be doing it?
Feb 23 07:47:36 <schanot>	OK.  Let me work on that and lets give Baker awhile to contact me
Feb 23 07:47:46 <daniels>	ok
Feb 23 07:47:54 <daniels>	is jorgen around?
Feb 23 07:48:29 <schanot>	manpower consists of me, Kurt, and The NASA guy.... but I'm the only one in the room at the moment
Feb 23 07:48:50 <schanot>	yes.  but not in the room at the moment.  what do you need?
Feb 23 07:48:59 <daniels>	i wanted to tell Jorgen that Ron Ruth's review is due to the Director's office TODAY and I haven't heard back from him on my first draft
Feb 23 07:49:31 <schanot>	roger that.  he's working on mine too.  when did this pushed so early?
Feb 23 07:49:59 <daniels>	there was an email sent quite a while ago about this.  I can check to see when...
Feb 23 07:50:15 <schanot>	didn't this used to be an april-may thing
Feb 23 07:51:09 <daniels>	not for associate scientists.  they have always been early and due the first round
Feb 23 07:51:20 <schanot>	Jorgen just came in.  he says it's on his list
Feb 23 07:51:53 <schanot>	he/we are also prepping for the RICO meeting
Feb 23 07:52:01 <daniels>	me too
Feb 23 07:52:16 <daniels>	btw, the email came out 1/29 and stith and albright were copied
Feb 23 07:52:33 <daniels>	when are you coming back?
Feb 23 07:55:31 <schanot>	am i still on?
Feb 23 07:55:37 <daniels>	yes
Feb 23 07:55:48 <schanot>	two messages dropped on this end
Feb 23 07:56:12 <daniels>	i just mentioned that the performance appraisal email came out 1/29 and stith and albright were copied
Feb 23 07:56:13 <schanot>	jorgen is new on this review thing
Feb 23 07:56:24 <daniels>	then I asked when you are coming back to CO?
Feb 23 07:56:40 <schanot>	3/3/04
Feb 23 07:57:03 <daniels>	i didn't know you were there for the duration!
Feb 23 07:57:30 <schanot>	yes, worked it out with Jorgen.  he took all of AIRS-II in Cleveland
Feb 23 07:58:00 <schanot>	Carolyn is certainly enjoying herself
Feb 23 07:58:10 <daniels>	on the beach?
Feb 23 07:58:21 <schanot>	ofcourse
Feb 23 07:58:38 <daniels>	happy to hear that!
Feb 23 07:58:53 <daniels>	what does she think of huatulco vs mazatlan?
Feb 23 07:59:12 <schanot>	how about i get the satelite system on the line and we meet back here in one hour?
Feb 23 07:59:38 <daniels>	how about 1.5 -- i've got to get the kids off to school before i leave for work?!?!
Feb 23 07:59:44 <schanot>	each has its charms.  long term - Maz has more to do
Feb 23 08:00:11 <daniels>	i have been on this chat since shortly after 7am (waiting for you!)
Feb 23 08:00:12 <schanot>	that's fine
Feb 23 08:00:17 <daniels>	see ya

Feb 23 09:28:52 <logger>	hi, is that you john
Feb 23 09:29:05 ---	logger is now known as daniels
Feb 23 09:31:02 <satcom>	Hello...yes it is.
Feb 23 09:31:23 <daniels>	we are expecting the hualtulco folks to respond very shortly
Feb 23 09:31:36 <daniels>	allen?
Feb 23 09:31:37 <satcom>	OK...just testing this chat
Feb 23 09:32:09 <daniels>	ok, great.  
Feb 23 09:33:22 <daniels>	i am giving them a call now
Feb 23 09:36:53 <daniels>	they will be on chat in 2 minutes
Feb 23 09:38:24 <schanot>	I'm back on line
Feb 23 09:38:30 <daniels>	john, are you there?
Feb 23 09:38:57 <satcom>	I'm here
Feb 23 09:39:37 <daniels>	ok, do you think it is worthwhile to try and give the configuration instructions over chat?
Feb 23 09:39:49 <satcom>	yes...we can try
Feb 23 09:39:52 <daniels>	allen?
Feb 23 09:41:56 <schanot>	yes
Feb 23 09:42:11 <daniels>	john is ready to give the instructions -- are you ready down there?
Feb 23 09:42:31 <schanot>	we don't have the unit on the modem quite yet
Feb 23 09:43:02 <satcom>	we do not need the satellite dish deployed at this time
Feb 23 09:43:34 <daniels>	so just disconnect the laptop and connect it to a phone line?
Feb 23 09:43:54 <schanot>	i understand that part.  i assume you want the satelite laptop hooked to a phone line
Feb 23 09:43:58 <satcom>	the laptop and the modems should be on and connected
Feb 23 09:44:31 <satcom>	yes, please connect a phone line to the laptop
Feb 23 09:46:18 <schanot>	hooked up and booting up now
Feb 23 09:47:36 <satcom>	after it is completely booted, right click on the 'WinRoute' icon in the system tray and click on "Stop WinRoute Engine"
Feb 23 09:48:34 <schanot>	WinRoute crashed on bootup
Feb 23 09:48:48 <daniels>	larry says that happens every time
Feb 23 09:48:54 <daniels>	just say ok
Feb 23 09:49:27 <satcom>	is there an incon in the system tray?
Feb 23 09:49:52 <schanot>	yes.  it is not running so can't stop it
Feb 23 09:50:01 <satcom>	ok
Feb 23 09:50:45 <satcom>	goto "Start/Programs/direcWay/web setup
Feb 23 09:51:03 <schanot>	got it
Feb 23 09:51:24 <satcom>	click on it and follow all defaults
Feb 23 09:51:56 <satcom>	it will attempt to dial out
Feb 23 09:52:01 <schanot>	asks for zip code.  didn't recognise Mexico before.  what do we do?
Feb 23 09:52:32 <satcom>	click on enter location manually and input the lat/long for your location
Feb 23 09:53:37 <satcom>	did you get a screen that said "Welcome to Web Setup"?
Feb 23 09:53:44 <schanot>	wait one
Feb 23 09:55:33 <schanot>	verifying connect now
Feb 23 09:55:50 <satcom>	good
Feb 23 09:56:20 <schanot>	need to modifgy dial up connect to use 9 for outside line.  wait one
Feb 23 09:56:50 <satcom>	ok
Feb 23 09:57:02 <schanot>	can we hookto the net through the firewall?
Feb 23 09:57:17 <daniels>	allen, one note re: lat/lon Larry Murphy is here and he said he left a note with this info.  He reports that the lat/lon he was entering is quite a bit different that what Jim Lasswell reports
Feb 23 09:57:33 <satcom>	lets try this first
Feb 23 09:57:44 <daniels>	no problem.  just wanted to note that
Feb 23 09:58:31 <schanot>	mike: Jody there to check dialup setup from here?  
Feb 23 09:59:09 <daniels>	just a sec
Feb 23 09:59:13 <daniels>	jody not at jeffco
Feb 23 09:59:24 <daniels>	what do you mean "dial up setup?"
Feb 23 09:59:45 <schanot>	this unit is not calling up the local podigy server.  set to something else internally.
Feb 23 09:59:56 <Ron>	I'm here at Jeffco if you need something.
Feb 23 10:00:06 <schanot>	wait one
Feb 23 10:00:45 <satcom>	the unit dials an 800 number to connect to the Hughes Registration Server
Feb 23 10:01:04 <daniels>	prodigy is not necessary, then.
Feb 23 10:01:09 <satcom>	no
Feb 23 10:01:12 <schanot>	That will not work from here!
Feb 23 10:01:33 <satcom>	you cannot dial an 800 number from there?
Feb 23 10:01:49 <schanot>	is larry there?
Feb 23 10:01:52 <daniels>	yes
Feb 23 10:02:19 <schanot>	how did he direct dial out to access U.S.
Feb 23 10:02:39 <daniels>	larry said you should be able to dial outside -- you need to look at the dialup networking connection on the computer on the left
Feb 23 10:02:50 <daniels>	on the far left machine if that makes sense
Feb 23 10:03:03 <schanot>	wait one
Feb 23 10:04:44 <schanot>	need root account on that machine to check settings
Feb 23 10:04:58 <satcom>	Mike, the difference in the lat/long could have been the problem all along. With an incorrect lat/long, the system timing never would have been correct
Feb 23 10:05:28 <schanot>	how accurate does the position need to be?
Feb 23 10:05:32 <daniels>	larry said he used the coordinates from the GPS in the skycasters system
Feb 23 10:05:41 <satcom>	within a minute
Feb 23 10:05:58 <satcom>	should have worked then
Feb 23 10:06:20 <satcom>	not sure why the other folks had something different
Feb 23 10:06:36 <daniels>	allen: were they at the airport?
Feb 23 10:06:59 <daniels>	i am checking into root access on that machine.  just a sec
Feb 23 10:07:27 <schanot>	we're ttying againe with dial codes
Feb 23 10:07:41 <daniels>	you don't need root access, then?
Feb 23 10:07:48 <schanot>	Larry: where is the note on the exact position?
Feb 23 10:08:05 <daniels>	larry is laughing
Feb 23 10:08:16 <daniels>	look in the book or on those yellow pieces of paper
Feb 23 10:08:48 <daniels>	gary or robert from skycasters should also know it
Feb 23 10:09:11 <schanot>	now i'm laughing
Feb 23 10:10:09 <satcom>	are you right in hualtulco?
Feb 23 10:10:10 <daniels>	trying to reach jody re: root access -- do you still need it?!?!?!!
Feb 23 10:10:31 <schanot>	we can't get directly to U.S. from these phone lines.
Feb 23 10:10:44 <daniels>	can you use a calling card?
Feb 23 10:12:21 <daniels>	sent an email to jody
Feb 23 10:12:35 <schanot>	can you give us the big picture?  why can't we access the web site via the server?
Feb 23 10:13:19 <daniels>	john: they are wondering if they can access this through a normal internet connection
Feb 23 10:13:21 <schanot>	we are trying to setup a link via the prodigy accounts that Jody setup.  That's how everything else works
Feb 23 10:13:37 <satcom>	if you can connect the laptop so that you can get to the web from it, this will work
Feb 23 10:14:32 <schanot>	will make last try on Prodigy dial up then over to server
Feb 23 10:15:12 <daniels>	if you connect via the server you will need to configure the network
Feb 23 10:15:38 <daniels>	there is a dhcp server running so it should be straightforward
Feb 23 10:17:52 <schanot>	wait one.  it will try to connect via prodigy, but won't finish
Feb 23 10:19:11 <schanot>	moving over to server
Feb 23 10:20:27 <daniels>	john, can we configure it for a dhcp network and is the laptop currently set for a static ip?
Feb 23 10:21:25 <satcom>	it is currently configured for a static ip, configure it for DHCP but we will have to reconfigure later
Feb 23 10:22:01 <daniels>	allen: right click on "My Network Places icon"
Feb 23 10:22:03 <schanot>	working on it
Feb 23 10:22:28 <schanot>	robbie know how to do it
Feb 23 10:22:48 <daniels>	note the current static settings tso that you can reconfigure back it later
Feb 23 10:23:03 <schanot>	done that already
Feb 23 10:23:35 <daniels>	ok, i was very worried that you were the one making the changes 
Feb 23 10:23:49 <satcom>	:)
Feb 23 10:23:50 <schanot>	not a chance.  you know me
Feb 23 10:24:13 <daniels>	need to run "ipconfig /all" from a command prompt after the changes are made
Feb 23 10:25:09 <schanot>	he's way ahead of you.  we're at web setup now.  
Feb 23 10:25:42 <daniels>	about time you had some competent folks down there -- THANKS ROBBIE.  OK, John can take it from here.
Feb 23 10:25:45 <satcom>	it should say that this machine is "connected to the internet"
Feb 23 10:26:36 <schanot>	downloading keys and data from registration server, etc modem authenticated, continuing

Feb 23 11:02:11 <schanot>	never heard of it
Feb 23 11:02:28 <schanot>	we are within a mile of what is technically Huatulco
Feb 23 11:03:10 <schanot>	anything further in this mode or do we set the whole thing back up?
Feb 23 11:03:56 <satcom>	have you opened antenna pointing?
Feb 23 11:04:22 <schanot>	does the laptop need to be connected to the dish?
Feb 23 11:04:29 <satcom>	not yet
Feb 23 11:04:40 <schanot>	proceeding
Feb 23 11:04:44 <satcom>	need to verify some setting in antenna pointing
Feb 23 11:05:14 <daniels>	BTW, Larry said he is pretty sure he used lat 15.0947 and lon 96.3475
Feb 23 11:05:30 <schanot>	ready
Feb 23 11:05:48 <satcom>	after antenna location, go next
Feb 23 11:06:07 <schanot>	on satelite parameters
Feb 23 11:06:31 <satcom>	longitude?
Feb 23 11:06:51 <schanot>	117 W
Feb 23 11:07:28 <satcom>	web setup did not complete...need to rerun...on what screen is it asking to restart?
Feb 23 11:07:56 <schanot>	working
Feb 23 11:08:36 <satcom>	after web setup, satellite longitude should read 91
Feb 23 11:09:18 <schanot>	web setup closes. dialog box pops up.  click next. says it chged setting. reboot
Feb 23 11:10:01 <satcom>	at what point in the process does this occur?
Feb 23 11:10:45 <schanot>	after it says registration finished. click continue. then the rest
Feb 23 11:12:17 <satcom>	lets let it reboot one more time
Feb 23 11:13:10 <schanot>	hey this is rob
Feb 23 11:13:20 <schanot>	just to let you know, what is happening is this:
Feb 23 11:14:11 <schanot>	after running the web setup a couple more times, I get the same situation.  It asks me to setup email addresses, and then comes back with a page saying "your account is registered for service"
Feb 23 11:14:52 <satcom>	that's normal
Feb 23 11:15:03 <schanot>	then a click on continue closes the web reg. browser, and a dialog asks me if i want to config dialup service as a backup.
Feb 23 11:15:14 <schanot>	after selecting no
Feb 23 11:15:44 <schanot>	it says changing directway network settings, etc etc in a dialog box.
Feb 23 11:15:51 <satcom>	normal
Feb 23 11:16:08 <schanot>	then registry updates, access keys updates, network setttings updated.
Feb 23 11:16:14 <satcom>	normal
Feb 23 11:16:25 <schanot>	then either click on "restart" or "dont restart"
Feb 23 11:16:43 <schanot>	i'll restart it now again.
Feb 23 11:16:55 <satcom>	what happens if you select "don't restart"?
Feb 23 11:18:23 <schanot>	if I select dont restart, which i tried once, the satellite diagnostics appears 
Feb 23 11:18:51 <schanot>	its the same one that appears on startup
Feb 23 11:19:46 <satcom>	do you ever get to a screen that asks for the zip code again?
Feb 23 11:20:01 <schanot>	no.
Feb 23 11:20:19 <schanot>	reboot complete
Feb 23 11:20:28 <satcom>	Is there a folder on the desktop named "SatSoft"?
Feb 23 11:20:39 <schanot>	yes
Feb 23 11:21:06 <satcom>	can you open it and see if there is 4.0.3.9 folder?
Feb 23 11:21:21 <satcom>	or direcway software
Feb 23 11:21:58 <schanot>	direcway 4.2.1.10 folder

Feb 23 12:23:46 <schanot>	no light on USB to serial cable/connector.  we set all connectors
Feb 23 12:24:11 <satcom>	does device manager show it's working?
Feb 23 12:25:11 <schanot>	yes
Feb 23 12:25:39 <satcom>	turn off the positioner, turn it on again and open the datastorm software
Feb 23 12:27:21 <schanot>	done that a few times
Feb 23 12:28:18 <satcom>	power everything off and reboot
Feb 23 12:28:33 <satcom>	modems also
Feb 23 12:28:58 <schanot>	working on it
Feb 23 12:33:18 <schanot>	no, its the same.
Feb 23 12:33:56 <satcom>	when you select comm 4 and click ok, you get the same message?
Feb 23 12:33:59 <schanot>	the USB<->serial port converter seems to be working
Feb 23 12:34:22 <schanot>	yes, but it appears much faster than com1,3 , which seems to mean that it is the correct port.
Feb 23 12:35:08 <schanot>	i tried wiggling the connections btw the PC and positioner & changing the USB port
Feb 23 12:35:13 <satcom>	did you check the serial connector on the back of the positioner?
Feb 23 12:35:27 <schanot>	ill disconnect it and reconnect it
Feb 23 12:38:16 <schanot>	should there be a number other than zero for "TX Serial Number"?
Feb 23 12:40:49 <satcom>	no, all zeros
Feb 23 12:41:08 <schanot>	ok, well I'm still stuck with not being able to connect.
Feb 23 12:41:38 <schanot>	I would try to replace the USB converter and serial connection if I had a spare
Feb 23 12:43:06 <satcom>	lets uninstall the datastorm software
Feb 23 12:43:23 <schanot>	ok I will. and then?
Feb 23 12:43:23 <satcom>	and reboot
Feb 23 12:44:05 <schanot>	ok

Feb 23 12:44:35 <schanot>	ok
Feb 23 12:44:37 <schanot>	one note
Feb 23 12:44:59 <schanot>	is that when I installed datastorm last time, the positioner was not on.
Feb 23 12:45:15 <schanot>	but of course it was on while I have been trying to connect..
Feb 23 12:45:21 <satcom>	that's ok. I often install it without a positioner
Feb 23 12:45:34 <schanot>	ok.
Feb 23 12:46:13 <satcom>	Va. Beach has had this system for some time. It's possible that the positioner and new software are not compatible
Feb 23 12:47:50 <schanot>	should we install 182B
Feb 23 12:47:57 <satcom>	yes
Feb 23 12:48:07 <schanot>	working
Feb 23 12:48:27 <schanot>	datastorm can't connect with mount
Feb 23 12:49:07 <satcom>	ok...lets install the dssetup one more time
Feb 23 12:50:00 <satcom>	you do have the positioner cable connected to the blue box?
Feb 23 12:51:07 <schanot>	you mean the modem? no other blue box
Feb 23 12:51:36 <satcom>	no..the cable between the black box and the large blue box
Feb 23 12:51:43 <schanot>	do you mean the antenna box?  then no
Feb 23 12:51:59 <satcom>	please connect all the cables
Feb 23 12:52:25 <schanot>	we told you we weren't connected.  
Feb 23 12:52:42 <satcom>	missed that
Feb 23 12:52:53 <schanot>	are we now in a place to hook EVERYTHING back together for the rest?
Feb 23 12:53:10 <satcom>	yes
Feb 23 12:53:45 <schanot>	we have to remove the laptop from the network to hook it up .  you understand that right?
Feb 23 12:53:55 <satcom>	yes
Feb 23 12:54:25 <schanot>	give us 10 - 15 minutes to move things around and re-connect.
Feb 23 12:54:42 <satcom>	ok..will grab a bite
Feb 23 12:55:04 <schanot>	or John Cowan)

Feb 23 13:17:39 <schanot>	one minute.
Feb 23 13:20:32 <satcom>	lets install the dssetup one more time
Feb 23 13:20:32 <satcom>	
Feb 23 13:20:36 <schanot>	we're hooked up. checked status now.
Feb 23 13:21:03 <satcom>	please install the dssetup software again
Feb 23 13:23:58 <schanot>	done
Feb 23 13:24:11 <satcom>	lets open datastorm 
Feb 23 13:24:15 <schanot>	connected and ready to proceed
Feb 23 13:24:19 <schanot>	open
Feb 23 13:24:29 <satcom>	click on refresh
Feb 23 13:24:36 <schanot>	OK
Feb 23 13:24:55 <satcom>	please tell me what the log/lat is in the datastorm software
Feb 23 13:26:50 <schanot>	15.7744N 96.0945W
Feb 23 13:27:30 <satcom>	this is really different then what mapPoint is giving us
Feb 23 13:28:08 <satcom>	are you near Puerto Angel?
Feb 23 13:29:14 <schanot>	several miles east of there
Feb 23 13:30:05 <satcom>	ok...lets write down the lat/long from the datastorm, shut down the datastorm and open antenna pointing
Feb 23 13:30:26 <schanot>	and then what
Feb 23 13:30:48 <satcom>	enter the new lat/long
Feb 23 13:30:59 <schanot>	this is an out the door and down the hall communications issue now
Feb 23 13:31:04 <satcom>	be sure to go 'Next' after entering 
Feb 23 13:31:54 <schanot>	done.  how about a sequence of things to do next?
Feb 23 13:32:11 <satcom>	open the datastorm software
Feb 23 13:32:16 <satcom>	click on refresh
Feb 23 13:32:26 <satcom>	click on find satellite
Feb 23 13:32:39 <satcom>	...and wait to see if it finds the satellite
Feb 23 13:32:59 <schanot>	working
Feb 23 13:34:05 <satcom>	when it finds the satellite it will:
Feb 23 13:34:15 <satcom>	peak the receive signal
Feb 23 13:34:34 <satcom>	run an isolation test (and peak)
Feb 23 13:35:09 <satcom>	and when it passes the isolation test the software will minimize
Feb 23 13:35:41 <satcom>	at this point we should be able to surf from the laptop
Feb 23 13:38:32 <schanot>	locked on satelite
Feb 23 13:38:38 <satcom>	good
Feb 23 13:38:47 <schanot>	sinal quality 10 / stregth 126
Feb 23 13:39:04 <schanot>	where can we access the isolation test
Feb 23 13:39:18 <satcom>	it should do it itself
Feb 23 13:39:40 <satcom>	thoses figures are not good
Feb 23 13:40:03 <satcom>	are they getting any better?
Feb 23 13:43:12 <schanot>	should we rerun the alignment setup ?  only done the auto so far.  any manual adjustments via antenna pointing?
Feb 23 13:44:49 <schanot>	strength went to 135
Feb 23 13:45:04 <satcom>	signal quality?
Feb 23 13:45:44 <schanot>	10
Feb 23 13:46:06 <satcom>	did it ever say that it aquired the satellite?
Feb 23 13:47:46 <schanot>	i dont think so, status is 'dish tested', not 'tx on' or anything else
Feb 23 13:47:51 <schanot>	and surfing doesnt work
Feb 23 13:48:13 <satcom>	on the data on the left hand side of the screen, are there any N/A's?
Feb 23 13:49:39 <schanot>	dish azimuth, gps altitude, compass's have N/A
Feb 23 13:50:40 <satcom>	at this point I think we need to do some dish calibrations
Feb 23 13:50:55 <schanot>	ok.  How to proceed?
Feb 23 13:51:03 <satcom>	stow the dish
Feb 23 13:51:18 <schanot>	ok
Feb 23 13:51:54 <satcom>	after it stows we need to determine if the dish is level. Do you have any type of level?
Feb 23 13:52:58 <schanot>	no, but it's a realitivly flat roof
Feb 23 13:54:36 <satcom>	within a degree or two?
Feb 23 13:54:40 -->	lmurphy (~lmurphy@dyn84-16.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 23 13:54:57 <schanot>	I'd say yes!
Feb 23 13:55:57 <satcom>	ok...let me know when the dish is stowed
Feb 23 13:56:55 <schanot>	There's a very slight pitch for water drainage
Feb 23 13:57:04 <satcom>	ok
Feb 23 13:57:20 <schanot>	it currently stowed
Feb 23 13:57:33 <satcom>	is the pitch at the front of the dish?
Feb 23 13:58:31 <schanot>	the antenna if anything is pitched slightly forward
Feb 23 13:58:40 <satcom>	ok
Feb 23 13:59:12 <satcom>	in the datastorm software there is a drop down box that says 'counts'
Feb 23 13:59:40 <satcom>	please select 'degrees'
Feb 23 14:00:05 <satcom>	and typa a 2 in the box to the left
Feb 23 14:00:05 <schanot>	ok
Feb 23 14:00:20 <schanot>	ok...
Feb 23 14:00:52 <satcom>	click on the up arrow above 'elevation' once...the dish should raise two degrees
Feb 23 14:01:54 <satcom>	in the upper right corner of the software, click on 'configure server'
Feb 23 14:02:04 <schanot>	OK
Feb 23 14:02:55 <satcom>	click on calibrate
Feb 23 14:03:04 <schanot>	OK
Feb 23 14:03:33 <satcom>	then check the 'tilt sensors' radio button and click next
Feb 23 14:04:09 <satcom>	click next until it is finished
Feb 23 14:04:53 <schanot>	done
Feb 23 14:05:12 <satcom>	close the calibration window and click the down arrow below the elevation
Feb 23 14:05:39 <schanot>	done
Feb 23 14:05:54 <satcom>	click on configure server again
Feb 23 14:06:00 <satcom>	and calibration
Feb 23 14:06:10 <schanot>	done
Feb 23 14:06:35 <schanot>	dish compass or tilt sensor
Feb 23 14:06:47 <satcom>	click on the dish calibration and click next
Feb 23 14:07:02 <satcom>	this will take about eight minutes
Feb 23 14:07:03 <schanot>	done
Feb 23 14:07:18 <satcom>	is the dish moving?
Feb 23 14:07:20 <schanot>	run complete test?
Feb 23 14:07:26 <satcom>	yes
Feb 23 14:08:15 <schanot>	dish is moving
Feb 23 14:09:18 <satcom>	please let me know when it is complete. BTW, after it stows, it comes back up a few degrees and then restows
Feb 23 14:19:09 <schanot>	calibration complete
Feb 23 14:20:39 <schanot>	next?
Feb 23 14:21:28 <satcom>	now for the hard part
Feb 23 14:21:39 <schanot>	ready
Feb 23 14:22:06 <satcom>	we need to do the compass calibration...this step is critical if we are going to find the satellite
Feb 23 14:22:39 <schanot>	OK.  sounds alot like what we did the first go around
Feb 23 14:22:56 <satcom>	begin the calibration and half way through it will ask us to turn the 'vehicle' 180
Feb 23 14:23:06 <schanot>	give us the whole string of instructions
Feb 23 14:23:40 <satcom>	when prompted to do so, move the blue box 180. try to be precise
Feb 23 14:23:47 <lmurphy>	It should help you guys (At the Gala) to know that there are already marks on the roof to match the corners of the box
Feb 23 14:24:11 <schanot>	thanks larry
Feb 23 14:24:35 <satcom>	after turning the box 180 come back and click the next button to finish the calibration
Feb 23 14:25:05 <schanot>	working on it
Feb 23 14:27:13 <schanot>	done = we assume we now return to original position?
Feb 23 14:28:18 <satcom>	it's not neccessary
Feb 23 14:28:56 <satcom>	ok, lets click on the refresh button and see if we have any N/A's in the data on the left
Feb 23 14:29:01 <schanot>	we leave the box 180 degrees out of original ?
Feb 23 14:29:47 <satcom>	you can move it back if you want. it will take the dish a little long to find the satellite but you don't have to move it back
Feb 23 14:30:18 <schanot>	had 4 N/As to start, but only GPS altitude left
Feb 23 14:30:51 <schanot>	will it in this orientations
Feb 23 14:31:37 <satcom>	please click refresh several times
Feb 23 14:31:56 <schanot>	done
Feb 23 14:32:10 <satcom>	still NA in GPS altitude?
Feb 23 14:32:22 <schanot>	yes
Feb 23 14:32:40 <satcom>	ok...perhaps it's because you are at sea level
Feb 23 14:32:51 <satcom>	please click fin satellite
Feb 23 14:32:55 <schanot>	dish is stowed is that correct?
Feb 23 14:32:59 <satcom>	yes
Feb 23 14:33:24 <schanot>	ok
Feb 23 14:33:45 <schanot>	dish moving
Feb 23 14:34:02 <satcom>	<fingers crossed>
Feb 23 14:34:27 <satcom>	from so much typing!!
Feb 23 14:34:51 <schanot>	so much for our 20 minute task
Feb 23 14:35:06 <satcom>	quicker by phone :)
Feb 23 14:35:27 <lmurphy>	I can attest to that.
Feb 23 14:37:05 <schanot>	quality 11 strength 138
Feb 23 14:37:58 <satcom>	hasn't found the satellite yet
Feb 23 14:39:04 <schanot>	no.  kind of points toward the building now.  plan to stow and rotate 180. then repeat.
Feb 23 14:39:24 <satcom>	is the building in the way?
Feb 23 14:39:46 <schanot>	on the north side
Feb 23 14:40:09 <schanot>	away from the angle
Feb 23 14:40:13 <satcom>	won't help
Feb 23 14:40:35 <schanot>	looking above the building
Feb 23 14:41:07 <satcom>	if it is not searching in the proper direction, turning the box will not make a difference
Feb 23 14:41:52 <schanot>	what direction should it be searching we were told it needed exposure to the SE
Feb 23 14:42:05 <satcom>	true
Feb 23 14:42:31 <schanot>	that side is wide open to the ocean all the way to china
Feb 23 14:43:18 <satcom>	what is the magnetic azimuth reading in the datastorm software
Feb 23 14:44:06 <schanot>	wait one we are rerunning auto start after 180 rotation
Feb 23 14:47:21 <satcom>	should be looking almot due east
Feb 23 14:48:30 <schanot>	azimuth 156.1 sinnal now worse
Feb 23 14:49:22 <lmurphy>	FYI, the original setup had the dish pointing at 145 degrees (the southeast arrow).
Feb 23 14:50:31 <schanot>	larry - any extra cable to shift the antenna?
Feb 23 14:50:32 <satcom>	what is the elevation under satellite longitude?
Feb 23 14:51:48 <lmurphy>	we only bought the two (100') cables because we were restricted by the length of the control cable.
Feb 23 14:52:20 <schanot>	70.6
Feb 23 14:52:55 <lmurphy>	There is plenty of cable to turn the antenna (if that is what you are talking about).
Feb 23 14:53:13 <schanot>	no
Feb 23 14:53:13 <satcom>	does the elevation of the dish seem to get that high?
Feb 23 14:55:34 <schanot>	looks about right.  pointing to open sky
Feb 23 14:56:50 <satcom>	my concern is if the elevation of the datastorm is capable of pointing 70 without running out of travel
Feb 23 14:58:03 <schanot>	do you mean the software can't control at such high angles?
Feb 23 14:59:43 <schanot>	what is the general opinion.  are we finished with this test?
Feb 23 15:01:00 <satcom>	not sure if the physical properties of the dish are allowing to to get to 70
Feb 23 15:01:51 <schanot>	we understand
Feb 23 15:02:02 <satcom>	let me make a call to MotoSat. I'll call Mike later. Sorry guys.
Feb 23 15:02:31 <daniels>	john, satmex5 does not require this, correct?
Feb 23 15:03:13 <satcom>	SatMex elevation is 54 where you are. I really think it is faulty equipment
Feb 23 15:03:25 <schanot>	thanks for the help.  we'll call it for today
Feb 23 15:03:30 <daniels>	ok, thanks
Feb 23 15:03:39 <satcom>	thanks
Feb 23 15:03:48 <daniels>	THANKS EVERYBODY!!!!!

Feb 23 15:04:12 <daniels>	allen, thanks a lot.  i bet you are cussing at me right now
Feb 23 15:04:50 <schanot>	OK Mike.  tomorrow is bad.  but if anything comes up, we can try somemore on Wed-Fri.
Feb 23 15:05:23 <jtanner>	exit
Feb 23 15:05:24 <daniels>	then i will look at travel issues for someone from RDP.  sounds like they will need to ship equipment this time...
Feb 23 15:05:33 <--	jtanner has quit (CGI:IRC)
Feb 23 15:05:57 <schanot>	no cussing.  i wanted to see it work.  robbie held off on lunch until 10 minutes ago
Feb 23 15:06:44 <schanot>	let's talk about further travel off line
Feb 23 15:07:01 <daniels>	ok, i will let you know what i find out from here.  pls tell Robbie thanks.  yes, we can talk offline.

Feb 25 09:03:40 <genzling>	Al, I'm here too. Nothing new on the customs yet. The inspector has been out till today and she hasn't called back. I'll let you know what I find out.
Feb 25 09:04:29 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Not much.  They are going to tie in the water mains today so we will not have water for a while.  They brought out the port-a-potties <g>.  Bet your glad your missing this.
Feb 25 09:04:40 <schanot>	Lowell- Used World Fuel today with no problems.  Henry talked to ASUR to help with the past billing, but not clear what will come of it.
Feb 25 09:05:25 <genzling>	Mark Grieco was going to try to make it retroactive and bill the old stuff thru them
Feb 25 09:10:19 <schanot>	OK Lowell.  That would be nice if they can work that out.

Feb 25 09:43:15 <schanot>	hi janet.  epson still won't print.  button will not move cartridges to proper location.  moved it manually with power off.
Feb 25 09:43:49 <schanot>	i tried the cleaning routine many many many times with no joy.  this is last resort
Feb 25 09:43:50 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Bill, you ganna be a "movie start" ? <g>.
Feb 25 09:45:37 <hercules-c130>	I'm trying not to break the lens, movies and stills.
Feb 25 09:46:32 <hercules-c130>	Actually all I'm really good for is turning on and off lights..
Feb 25 09:47:42 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Quick on Hockey, the guy from the Ducks is pretty good.  He is big going 225 at 6-2. Seems to play well so far. The Blues and Pheonix fired thier coaches today. Av's lost last night.
Feb 25 09:48:05 <anstett>	if the printer is not printing at all, replacing the print cartridges may not help either.
Feb 25 09:49:50 <schanot>	looks like the cartridge change worked.  some slop on the edge, but I can use the print as is
Feb 25 09:50:34 <schanot>	the hot chocolate is still great! just finished my morning cup
Feb 25 09:51:43 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Al you are going to pay for all that chocolate.  I'm still trying to loose the weight I picked up <g>.
Feb 25 09:54:28 <schanot>	i'm sure you are right.
Feb 25 09:55:36 <hercules-c130>	me too, you guys had everything set up so nice, we haven't had to do very much
Feb 25 09:56:08 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Just wait.  Packing out will work some of it off of you <g>.
Feb 25 09:56:50 <hercules-c130>	true, so who's the other guy we got and from where, skoula went to the ducks right
Feb 25 09:58:42 <hercules-c130>	skoula for th??is big defensemen from the ducks, right, sauer is his name
Feb 25 10:01:15 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Yep.  Skoula is gone to the Ducks for, I think sauer and a draft pick in '05, fourth round I think.
Feb 25 10:01:55 <hercules-c130>	cool, and who's the other trade for and who'd we give up?
Feb 25 10:04:05 <anstett>	instructions from the epson manual to follow
Feb 25 10:04:11 <anstett>	How To / Replacing Ink Cartridges
Feb 25 10:04:11 <anstett>	To replace an ink cartridge using the printer's control panel, follow the steps below.
Feb 25 10:04:11 <anstett>		Make sure the printer is on. The power light should be on, but not flashing. (Determine which cartridge needs to be replaced as indicated by the black and color ink out light.)
Feb 25 10:04:11 <anstett>		Lower the output tray at the front of the printer, then open the printer cover.
Feb 25 10:04:11 <anstett>		Hold down the cleaning button for three seconds. The print head moves left to the ink cartridge replacement position, and the power light begins flashing.
Feb 25 10:04:14 <anstett>			Caution:
Feb 25 10:04:16 <anstett>			Do not move the print head by hand as this may damage the printer. Always use the cleaning button to move it.
Feb 25 10:04:19 <anstett>			Note:
Feb 25 10:04:21 <anstett>			If you press the cleaning button for three seconds when the black and color ink out lights are off, the printer starts cleaning the print head.
Feb 25 10:05:02 <schanot>	Bill, this Kurt.  I need you to compare the FWD video GPS time with the time on on of the DSM, FWD time card.  THe LEDS on the card and let me know if there is any difference in time?
Feb 25 10:05:35 <schanot>	Secondly, do you have an ETA?
Feb 25 10:06:52 <hercules-c130>	the time difference is approx. 1.5  seconds (best guess)
Feb 25 10:09:35 <hercules-c130>	kurt that time difference i gave you is from the display in discwin and the display on vcr monitor
Feb 25 10:10:33 <hercules-c130>	that time also matches up nicely with the time on the front of the fwd dsm 
Feb 25 10:11:37 <hercules-c130>	and the red clock numbers on the timing card
Feb 25 10:12:14 <hercules-c130>	ETA is about an hour from now
Feb 25 10:12:22 <schanot>	fine.  What is youe ETA back at Huatulco?  still 1215?
Feb 25 10:13:22 <hercules-c130>	these long flights kill me

Feb 25 10:23:04 <hercules-c130>	eta was answered at 10:12:10, an hour from now!!
Feb 25 10:28:15 <schanot>	in whose time coordinates?  it is 1128 CST right now
Feb 25 10:28:43 <schanot>	we did not get a message at 10:10
Feb 25 10:29:07 <hercules-c130>	an hour from 16 minutes ago, still means 44 minutes from now
Feb 25 10:29:21 <schanot>	roger that.  right on time
Feb 25 10:29:23 <hercules-c130>	it's posted on my chat??
Feb 25 10:29:37 <schanot>	dropping off now.  heading for the airport
Feb 25 10:30:43 <--	schanot has quit (CGI:IRC (EOF))
Feb 25 10:31:05 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	The Bougher is the other defense man. Aquired from Carolina for a third round pick in 04 which was aquired from Washington. He is 32, 6 0 205 with 5 assists and 80 PIM this year. Career 14G 51A 1320PIM. On the Duck trade we got the draft pick.
Feb 25 10:31:19 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	I wanted to wait for Al to go <g>.
Feb 25 10:31:54 <hercules-c130>	smart man, although i think it was kurt, did you see the eta time at 10;10?
Feb 25 10:32:18 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	I saw your ETA but I did not see the time. I don
Feb 25 10:32:48 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Don't know if it is logged on all machines.  It may have gotten lost in all the stuff Janet sent.
Feb 25 10:33:03 <hercules-c130>	huh
Feb 25 10:33:38 <hercules-c130>	if you saw it, it had to go out, oh well, headed for pictures of a weather radar station, then home
Feb 25 10:34:02 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	You get time stamps on the far left of your screen.  I don't have them on my screen at all.  I do not remember if the chat on the website has timestamps or not.
Feb 25 10:34:21 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	The message went out, it may not have had a timestamp at our end.
Feb 25 10:34:37 <hercules-c130>	ah
Feb 25 10:34:38 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Did they get any good stuff on the flight?
Feb 25 10:35:04 <hercules-c130>	no, this was a show and tell flight for mexican weather service folks

Feb 26 09:10:23 <darrel-c130>	Looks fine on this terminal
Feb 26 09:10:58 <schanot>	probably at SATCOM glitch.  won't be very interesting for Michael

Feb 26 10:19:08 <schanot>	This is Michael Rosengaus, talking through allen schanot slot. How high are the waves? 
Feb 26 10:20:38 <djama-c130>	basically doing 4 x-wind legs at 100' at each "station" starting from close to shore all the way outbound when we dtermine that the wind/wave action has subsided. At that point we will climb to 4000' and head inbound while dropping 10-12 sondes.

Feb 26 11:49:38 <darrel-c130>	Hi Janet, we did a print screen then saved it as an image in png format. It seems to have been saved inthe /ads directory. This a winds screen on the front right laptop.
Feb 26 11:51:15 <darrel-c130>	I think the machine is calledblanc. I'd like get the filesince it really is a nice example of how to use winds.
Feb 26 11:53:53 <anstett>	ftp to hercules as ads user; cd to /jnet/r1; you should see .ads files for today flight named 150rf??a.ads where ?? is the number of the research flight; put your png image here; cd to /jnet/r2; put your image here also; that way your image will be on both removables and then have allen get the file off of the removable for you after the flight.

Feb 26 12:22:46 <darrel-c130>	We have a memory lapse at the moment, but Al will be here at the end of flight and can probably help us.
Feb 26 12:26:25 <anstett>	The password for ads is the new password, similar to the old password, but different color and tree.
Feb 26 12:27:55 <anstett>	The directory on hercules to put the image in could just be /r1 instead of /jnet/r1.  If you see the data file from today's flight, then you know that you are in the correct directory.

Feb 26 12:37:23 <stith>	I'm off to return to the RICO meeting.   Keep up the great work.   And pass along my thanks to the flight crew for their hard flying efforts.  
Feb 26 12:39:54 <sabl-c130>	Mike or Bruce, is it ok/safe to lase down at 4000 feet over the coast?
Feb 26 12:40:40 <darrel-c130>	Al, pilots estimate between 4:15 and 4:30.
Feb 26 12:41:22 <schanot>	Mike is out for a while.  I don't think reflection will be a proiblem with this sea state.  should be no eye safety issues over the water.
Feb 26 12:41:44 <schanot>	Thanks Darrel.
Feb 26 12:42:32 <schanot>	Jonathan, it will be 20-30 minutes before Mike returns.  I assume you need an answer before then?

Feb 26 12:59:18 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Al, I don't think that Hercules has the new password. You might start with the old one and then try the new one.
Feb 26 13:00:19 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Ta, You have the Lat Lon on ADS.  Are you looking for some way to see them on the Jeppsen chart?
Feb 26 13:01:25 <anstett>	i'm 99% sure that hercules has the new password.
Feb 26 13:03:35 <anstett>	anyways, darrel said that he did figure out the password on hercules.  Hercules is the new one and most of the laptops on the plane are most likely the old password.
Feb 26 13:07:58 <hercules-c130>	Yes!John PI want lat&long able display on Jeppsen gird chart
Feb 26 13:09:14 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Let me see if Larry knows.
Feb 26 13:09:47 <hercules-c130>	Also Just let you know ADS have a new Password 
Feb 26 13:13:03 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Ta, We cannot figuar it out here because we do not have a Jep display.  They should be able to see that Lat Lon on the laptop.  You could mess with the computer by you and see if you can get it to come up.  Sorry.  Thanks for the info on the pasword. I'm glad you klnow what the new one is.

Feb 26 13:23:37 <schanot>	jonathan, if you are 1000 meter above ground over the lagoon it is ok to lase down
Feb 26 13:24:13 <sabl-c130>	OK, that is what I thought, Thanks!
Feb 26 13:25:11 <schanot>	how deep is the boundry layer today?
Feb 26 13:25:24 <sabl-c130>	just to make sure, just hte lagoon and not the coast line, is this right?
Feb 26 13:28:03 <schanot>	you probably will not be above 1000 meter on ferry to/from airport. the rule is no lasing over ground except in the lagoon area and no lasing looking down if below 1000 meter
Feb 26 13:28:56 <sabl-c130>	thanks
Feb 26 13:29:54 <schanot>	going to have lunch overlooking the pool in a chair that does not bounce or shake
Feb 26 13:37:04 <schanot>	hey Ta.  Is the top dew pointer still showing significant oscillation?
Feb 26 13:47:58 <hercules-c130>	Yes! It does! I will print it to you.Look like top& bottom dewpointer do the same thing
Feb 26 13:48:53 <--	lmurphy has quit (Leaving)
Feb 26 13:56:48 <schanot>	Ta.  Balance the top dewpointer.  leave the bottom one alone for now.
Feb 26 13:57:52 <hercules-c130>	Okay Al Will do
Feb 26 14:06:53 <schanot>	I've got Bill here.  What is timing for the drop and the latest on Huatulco ETA?
Feb 26 14:09:27 <darrel-c130>	Al. We are checking but expect ETA as earlier sent.
Feb 26 14:10:40 <cockpit-c130>	Allen
Feb 26 14:11:01 <cockpit-c130>	 Allen: Do you copy?  CARL
Feb 26 14:11:39 <schanot>	OK thanks.  you might ask Ken which phone Axel has.  I can update them if need be as need be
Feb 26 14:11:59 <schanot>	yes carl. i'm here
Feb 26 14:12:32 <cockpit-c130>	AS: Axel has ...5497
Feb 26 14:13:29 <schanot>	thanks.  techs tell me major grid lock on road to airport.  they have not moved for 5-10 minutes.  cause uncertain
Feb 26 14:14:00 <cockpit-c130>	AS: We are starting 100 foot runs near Salina Cruz.  Don't knowexactly when we will be over Gala to the BT drop CARL
Feb 26 14:14:53 <schanot>	OK. they just left to get set up.  I will monitor chat until 1540. then leave for the airport.
Feb 26 14:21:41 <genzling>	Al, Shelley says we need to book the hotel rooms and charge the credit cards for the Rico Projedt now. Should we doit now. Shannon wants some guidance
Feb 26 14:24:21 <--	sabl-c130 has quit (Ping timeout)
Feb 26 14:24:27 <genzling>	al, the reeason we are asking is that 3 days will be charged to the card.  Shannon is seeing Gerry to see if we can use another credit card to hold them all

Feb 26 14:25:07 <schanot>	Yes, but! I thought the plan was to have NCAR prepay the rooms.  This will be very hard for people to handle on personal CC.  Which do they propose?
Feb 26 14:26:14 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Looks like the 130 went offline.
Feb 26 14:26:16 <schanot>	i thought the rooms had to be completely prepaid months in advance, if not immediately on booking
Feb 26 14:27:47 <schanot>	on some projects NCAR just pays all the rooms on a contract.  then people just gets the base perdiem for the rest.
Feb 26 14:28:24 <schanot>	that would be best in this case.  jORGEN HAS THE TRAVEL SPECIFICS ON EVERYBODY
Feb 26 14:29:42 <schanot>	I don't think my credit card can handle any more at the moment.  particularly since the phone lines from here are part of my bill and I don't know what that is going to come in at!
Feb 26 14:29:46 <genzling>	Shannon is calling the hotel to see if we can use one credit card to reserve all of the rooms 
Feb 26 14:30:39 <genzling>	Shannon has the dates and the people but that could change if some one quits or new hires etc
Feb 26 14:30:54 <schanot>	OK.  We do need to take action right away, though.  BB says there will be over 104 non-NCAR researchers on the island for RICO.
Feb 26 14:31:25 <schanot>	we'll just have to adjust with necessary changes.  better to have rooms in hand for the rest
Feb 26 14:31:34 <genzling>	That means we really do need ot get our foot in the door!
Feb 26 14:31:45 <schanot>	i agree
Feb 26 14:33:27 <schanot>	John:  ION data feed is also down.  you want to try and call them via the std SATCOM?
Feb 26 14:35:31 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	I can try Al. I will have to try and find the number.
Feb 26 14:35:44 <schanot>	they had a fairly long drop out earlier
Feb 26 14:36:28 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	I saw that also, but not all the computers dropped off chat at once.  I think I have the file online.
Feb 26 14:36:32 <schanot>	they are due back between 1615 and 1630 local anyway.  just nice to know they are still safe and flying
Feb 26 14:38:15 <schanot>	got to go in five to make the airport in time.  grid lock on the road today according to kurt.  they didn't move for 5-10 minutes.  said it was clearing though
Feb 26 14:38:52 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	Okay Al I will try and give them a call.  If I cannot get thru or find them I will call you on your Cell.
Feb 26 14:41:16 <schanot>	thanks. i'm out of here!
Feb 26 14:41:55 <schanot>	cell phone coverage is spotty on the road to the airport.
Feb 26 14:42:52 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	I'll just keep trying.  I'm still trying to find the numbers.

Feb 27 08:06:09 <schanot>	Darrel- I see the well defined plume again
Feb 27 08:06:23 <hercules-c130>	howdy, fairly bumpy +- 20 m/sec.  not much more than that a the present time.
Feb 27 08:06:40 <schanot>	will check Quilscat for update
Feb 27 08:07:19 <schanot>	wind speeds look alot like yesterday.  hopefully they will increase as the flight progrsses
Feb 27 08:11:35 <hercules-c130>	wish you were on board!
Feb 27 08:13:58 <schanot>	got the edge of a quikscat pass.  looks fairly old.  hard to read swath times
Feb 27 08:15:38 <schanot>	wind direction south of 15N seems pretty steady at 030 to 035 degrees down to 10N.  more northerly near coast
Feb 27 08:15:57 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	It's supposed to be 62 today with sun.  This weekend we will have a front move through with maybe some snow.  Next week is clear highs in the 40's.
Feb 27 08:16:44 <schanot>	max speeds around 30-35 knts.  will check again later for more updates
Feb 27 08:21:16 <bruce>	Hi Mike.  I am here.  How's the boss?
Feb 27 08:21:43 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	I'm going to go work in the back lab.  I'll check for updates about every 30 min or so.  Have a good flight.
Feb 27 08:24:14 <darrel-c130>	Hi Al, Good plume indeed. Multiple passes in fron of outflow with identical signatures in particles and fast O3
Feb 27 08:26:21 <sabl-c130>	all ok tody, could you ask eric, shane, scott about their needs to work on sabl immediately after we return. jeffco people are starting to ask if we want to pull the pod asap or play with it thurs/fri

Feb 27 09:51:18 <schanot>	yo darrel.  looks like you caught the plume at your current distance!!
Feb 27 09:52:22 <schanot>	the wind field is more uniform today.  not as much veering with distance from shore.
Feb 27 09:54:47 <hercules-c130>	i'll do what i can from here
Feb 27 09:57:27 <schanot>	newest quikscat fails to show current event, even though we have regional coverage,  alternate pass on edge, but show some signs of what you are seeing.

Feb 27 12:23:32 <sabl-c130>	we are getting many sun shots. none that saturate the receiver. mostly in the greens and yellows.

Feb 27 12:30:18 <darrel-c130>	Seems similar to yesterday. Plume axis to west of wind core.
Feb 27 12:31:17 <allen>	we tracked that for a while.  been off line for about an hour. looks like a solid case

Feb 27 12:48:20 <schanot>	OK Lowell - I got the info on the RICO rooms and the customs approval for JeffCO.  That will make it a much shorter day.
Feb 27 12:49:11 <schanot>	I am going to try and arrange to pack the C-130 on Tuesday and clear Mexican customs then leaving just personal luggage for Wednesday.
Feb 27 12:50:14 <schanot>	We were going to try and get in between 1400 and 1500 MST, but will have to let you know early next week.

Feb 27 13:21:11 <genzling>	Al, I told her it would probably be about 3:00 Pm but would update as it got closer
Feb 27 13:23:31 <bruce>	I just read your comments about sun into the receiver - doesn't look like a direct shot of the sun yet 
Feb 27 13:23:58 <sabl-c130>	have you talked to others about taking racks out of c130 thurs/fri?
Feb 27 13:24:37 <bruce>	Not yet.  Is that what has been requested?
Feb 27 13:26:17 <sabl-c130>	do not know.  we need to decide what we want to ask raf. get things off before wash or after.
Feb 27 13:27:35 <bruce>	Our first choice is to put the window blank in and remove pod and racks later.
Feb 27 13:28:34 <sabl-c130>	ok, we need to tell bob olsen our intentions.
Feb 27 13:29:27 <bruce>	I sent an email to al and jens but will follow up so everyone is on the same page.
Feb 27 13:30:57 <sabl-c130>	great. we are finally looking down but not seeing much. i think we might be salted over today
Feb 27 13:33:30 <bruce>	You did spend a lot of time down low today.  You have earned yur pool time!  Check with Jefe first.

Feb 27 13:57:08 <--	cockpit-c130 has quit ([x]chat)
Feb 27 14:01:10 <darrel-c130>	Dave, Today's flight was pretty muchlike yestreday's. Everything working well with both good supermicron and pollution mapping data. Diffren appears to be wind shift from NNE to SE with altitude. This gives interesting structure aloft to particle andd ozone. We will do one more mapping of plume before coming home.   Al, I'll check ETA.
Feb 27 14:02:17 <darrel-c130>	Just talked to Ed and he expects 4:10 touch down.
Feb 27 14:03:40 <schanot>	OK. thanks
Feb 27 14:04:47 <schanot>	try and get the down sun approach.  sounds like you're good and salty today
Feb 27 14:06:29 <darrel-c130>	I'll pass along the recommendation. I took a shower today, so only my humor is salty. 
Feb 27 14:08:12 <schanot>	I got salty the old fashioned way...... got dipped in the ocean.  glad you guys only got sprayed
Feb 27 14:09:14 <schanot>	Kurt- No action needed from you on the RICO wing stores right now.  Jorgen got input from Spowart on power and wiring to the wings.
Feb 27 14:09:51 <schanot>	Jorgen & I talked over some of the other impacts.  This won't be a final decision today, in any case.
