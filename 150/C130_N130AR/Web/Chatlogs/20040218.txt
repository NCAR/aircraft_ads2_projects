Feb 18 12:33:00 <jtanner>	hi - who's there?
Feb 18 12:34:34 <bruce>	I am still watching but it is very quiet today.
Feb 18 12:35:48 <jtanner>	i heard the plane couldn't fly today.  What happened?
Feb 18 12:40:05 <bruce>	I haven't heard anything.
Feb 18 12:56:08 <Ron>	Allen, wassup?
Feb 18 12:58:38 <schanot>	hello everyone.  welcome to the show!
Feb 18 12:59:16 <schanot>	today's flight was cancelled one hour in due to an engine problem.
Feb 18 12:59:57 <schanot>	all better now.  we're ready to start the 1400 briefing so i'll be in and out for a while
Feb 18 13:00:21 <schanot>	Jody - did you check your email?  is Mike D. around?
Feb 18 13:01:19 <jtanner>	I did check email.  I'm at Jeffco and can't reach Mike via phone
Feb 18 13:01:42 <schanot>	any comment on the satelite issue?
Feb 18 13:02:48 <jtanner>	I just called Mike on his cell.  he'll get on-line shortly
Feb 18 13:03:09 <jtanner>	it sounds like the satellite was working until Rob changed something. 
Feb 18 13:03:18 <jtanner>	do you know what he changed.  is he around to ask?
Feb 18 13:06:07 -->	daniels (~daniels@atd-trout.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 18 13:06:13 <daniels>	wasssssup
Feb 18 13:08:13 <jtanner>	hey mike.  sounds like the satellite dish won't stay locked onto the satellite. 
Feb 18 13:08:27 <daniels>	just read allens message.  is brandon around, too?
Feb 18 13:09:28 <daniels>	ive got another meeting at 130...  will people be here soon?
Feb 18 13:09:57 <daniels>	i can reschedule it for 1/2 hour later if that helps
Feb 18 13:10:02 <jtanner>	Allen is on-line.  
Feb 18 13:10:18 <daniels>	why is he so quiet?
Feb 18 13:10:31 <jtanner>	Allen, is Rob around?  Also, do you know who Larry talked to at SkyCasters?
Feb 18 13:12:06 <jtanner>	maybe they're busy 
Feb 18 13:12:43 <jtanner>	so, if the company admits that there is a problem with the satellite,
Feb 18 13:12:50 <jtanner>	then should we just have them forget about it?
Feb 18 13:12:57 <daniels>	brandon is here in my office, just a sec...
Feb 18 13:13:10 <schanot>	hold on, meeting continues
Feb 18 13:13:25 <daniels>	what meeting?
Feb 18 13:16:11 <daniels>	we need to know who was contacted from skycasters
Feb 18 13:18:06 <daniels>	brandon will contact the skycasters sales rep while we wait for your meeting to finish
Feb 18 13:18:25 <daniels>	i would lake a complete rundown of what has been done so far and by whom
Feb 18 13:20:00 <daniels>	my other meeting has been moved to 230
Feb 18 13:20:53 <jtanner>	yesterday Joe and I chatted with Al and Larry.  We asked them to change some settings
Feb 18 13:21:28 <jtanner>	we never heard back if our changes were successful.  I doubt they were.  So I can tell them what to change back.
Feb 18 13:22:07 <daniels>	i am trying to get brandon on chat...
Feb 18 13:22:44 <schanot>	OK meeting finished
Feb 18 13:22:44 <--	jtanner has quit (CGI:IRC (EOF))
Feb 18 13:22:46 -->	jtanner (~80755465@linus.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 18 13:23:20 <daniels>	just a sec
Feb 18 13:25:10 <schanot>	Tech support at skycasters has been contacted numerous times, Larry has talked to Robert, Todd, Gary and Jeremy to name a few.
Feb 18 13:26:37 <schanot>	It has been determined by Tech Support and Larry that their Sat coverage here in Mexico is not sufficient enough to keep a reliable signal.
Feb 18 13:26:54 <daniels>	who in tech support?
Feb 18 13:27:44 <jtanner>	also, did anyone communicate to skycasters via email?
Feb 18 13:29:12 <--	bruce has quit (CGI:IRC)
Feb 18 13:29:19 <schanot>	No to e-mail. Much time has been spent working with the system and tech support simultaneously.
Feb 18 13:30:07 ---	schanot is now known as Larry
Feb 18 13:31:05 <jtanner>	hi larry. 
Feb 18 13:31:11 <daniels>	hi larry.  brandon said that he specifically asked them the question about coverage in mexico.  so we need to know who from skycasters said it was not available
Feb 18 13:31:34 <Larry>	Look at the skycastrers website for coverage of the SatMex5 satellite.
Feb 18 13:32:59 <jtanner>	huatulco looks like it's on the edge of that coverage.  is that what you see too?
Feb 18 13:33:12 <jtanner>	Mike, the page is http://www.skycasters.com/satellite-internet-coverage/index.html
Feb 18 13:33:17 <Larry>	Gary was the last person that I dicussed our situation with. He did not say that it was not avail. Only that it probably not be reliable enough for us to use.
Feb 18 13:34:55 <Larry>	I did much testing and tweaking with the system and had it working several times only to come back later and it would not be working.
Feb 18 13:35:26 -->	brandon (~80755039@linus.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 18 13:35:38 <daniels>	hi brandon
Feb 18 13:35:43 <brandon>	Hello
Feb 18 13:36:06 <daniels>	were you able to contact skycasters?
Feb 18 13:36:24 <brandon>	Calling now.
Feb 18 13:36:30 <Larry>	The system tests is TX on a regular basis. If it determines that it;s signal is not good enough it shuts itself down,
Feb 18 13:38:09 <brandon>	Who at Skycasters have we been talking to?
Feb 18 13:38:12 <daniels>	brandon, just a recap.  larry heard from a tech support person (gary) that the satellite signal is too weak to be reliable
Feb 18 13:39:32 <brandon>	I am talking to Anne Salmon at Skycasters now.  She is our Account Executive.
Feb 18 13:40:22 <daniels>	let's first ask them about the coverage in huatulco
Feb 18 13:40:59 <daniels>	then ask them about the behavior larry describes, i.e. shutting down on a weak signal - is there a way to disable this?
Feb 18 13:41:17 <brandon>	She is checking her coverage map now,  she was sure she had checked it before.
Feb 18 13:41:36 <daniels>	Larry/Jody at this point how confident are we that the system is configured properly?
Feb 18 13:41:42 <Larry>	Tech support ar skycasters is 757-306-4910. Hit 1 several times and then wait for a human to answer
Feb 18 13:42:49 <brandon>	Anne is going to walk down the hall and talk to Gary.  She says that this same dish has worked in Guatamala, which is south of you.
Feb 18 13:43:04 <jtanner>	I asked them to make some changes yesterday.
Feb 18 13:43:08 <Larry>	Basically we only ever got it to work, stand alone, not as a server.  and only for short intervals in that mode.
Feb 18 13:43:10 <jtanner>	I think those changes are incorrect
Feb 18 13:43:42 <daniels>	i asked ron to create an chat account so perhaps the skycasters tech support can join in...
Feb 18 13:44:04 <Larry>	drop the networking.  we are talking satelite performance, specifically.
Feb 18 13:44:46 <daniels>	jody: where these network settings?
Feb 18 13:45:06 <brandon>	Anne is going to talk to Gary.  I have given them the URL and the satcom login information that Ron set up.
Feb 18 13:45:14 <jtanner>	we had them change the 2nd ethernet adapter gateway settings.
Feb 18 13:45:19 <jtanner>	remember that larry?
Feb 18 13:45:36 <Larry>	the network discussion is irrelavant at this point.  The satelite won't support reliable contact.
Feb 18 13:45:58 ---	Larry is now known as allen
Feb 18 13:47:09 <daniels>	and so signal strength/satellite lock is based on some sort of status light or other indication?
Feb 18 13:47:49 <allen>	The unit down in Guatamala could be on a different satelite which we cannot receive without brand new arrangements
Feb 18 13:48:27 <allen>	si.  which will not stay above nominal levels
Feb 18 13:49:31 <daniels>	so it's a red-yellow-green indicator or LED bars or something?
Feb 18 13:49:51 <allen>	digital meter
Feb 18 13:49:57 <daniels>	ok
Feb 18 13:50:17 <daniels>	and are there settings on the steering unit that are user configurable?
Feb 18 13:50:17 <--	brandon has quit (CGI:IRC (EOF))
Feb 18 13:50:33 -->	brandon (~80755039@linus.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 18 13:50:48 <allen>	yes and those have been tweaked many times and in small increments
Feb 18 13:51:01 <daniels>	and how confident are we that they are now correct?
Feb 18 13:51:51 <jtanner>	with the changes that Joe and I asked them to do yesterday, I'm not confident.
Feb 18 13:51:54 <allen>	Very!
Feb 18 13:52:35 <daniels>	jody: as Larry mentioned, were these changes in the settings of the steering unit?
Feb 18 13:52:41 <allen>	Those settings have nothing to do with the operation of the SaT itself,
Feb 18 13:53:39 <daniels>	brandon" any luck with skycasters tech support on chat?
Feb 18 13:54:03 <--	jtanner has quit (CGI:IRC)
Feb 18 13:54:04 <allen>	Jody is talking software and IP settings.  We are talking straight satelite ops
Feb 18 13:54:30 <daniels>	i understand that.  sorry i have to ask redundant questions - i'm just trying to get up to speed
Feb 18 13:54:44 <brandon>	Regaurdless of changes made to knobs and meters and such, this is supposed to be "very user friendly" to set up.  Plug in cables, turn it on and select "Auto Deployment"
Feb 18 13:55:02 <daniels>	then i wonder why we had to change the seetings in the first place?
Feb 18 13:55:05 <brandon>	It sounds as if that is not the case in this instance.
Feb 18 13:55:31 <brandon>	Anne is off talking to Gary, I gave them the info.
Feb 18 13:55:46 <daniels>	ok
Feb 18 13:56:08 <allen>	it is not auto down here.  We did all of this work in direct contact with skycatsers.  
Feb 18 13:56:14 -->	jtanner (~80755465@linus.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 18 13:56:38 <daniels>	So auto was tried and did not work?
Feb 18 13:57:40 <allen>	we started with auto as the instructions said.  we moved on with skycasters to at least get a lock.
Feb 18 13:58:32 <daniels>	did we get different settings from each of the skycasters tech support folks?
Feb 18 13:58:55 <allen>	it took alot of fine adjustment.  many system calibrations... particularly on dish pointing controls
Feb 18 13:59:43 <allen>	we worked through all of them via tech support and got a connection.  we moved on to work with Jody to use as server.
Feb 18 14:00:28 <allen>	hoped to make it work today, but the satelite keeps dropping the lock.  not much use working on the server part if it won't hold lock.
Feb 18 14:00:50 <daniels>	and when the connection drops, the unit shuts down and does not automatically restart?
Feb 18 14:01:26 <allen>	correcto
Feb 18 14:02:13 <daniels>	any feel for how often the link drops?  e.g. does it stay up for 30 min then drop, 1 hour, etc.?
Feb 18 14:02:45 <allen>	from tests run- 5 minutes average between drops
Feb 18 14:03:10 <daniels>	and the length of the drop?
Feb 18 14:03:41 <daniels>	i.e. does it usually lock again once restarted?
Feb 18 14:04:20 <allen>	it doesn't restart. so where are you going?  seems to be somewhat weather dependent.... winds, clouds, etc
Feb 18 14:04:37 <daniels>	i mean once you manually restart
Feb 18 14:05:06 <allen>	when restarted manually. sometimes yes, sometimes no.
Feb 18 14:05:06 <daniels>	i just wonder if there is a way to disable the shutdown and have it keep retrying
Feb 18 14:06:30 <allen>	much of my expertise leaves tomorrow.  we are going to terminate further action on the satelite unless you guys want to take it further
Feb 18 14:06:30 <daniels>	there is software called ofps (or something like that) that can failover to another link if the main one should drop
Feb 18 14:07:26 <daniels>	i for one would like to discuss things with tech support.  this could be a contractual issue and if it does not work as advertised and promised we need a refund
Feb 18 14:09:00 <allen>	we are beyond things that we can work on.  I don't have more project cash to throw at this.  do you want to fund something further/
Feb 18 14:09:32 <daniels>	we've got TONS of cash
Feb 18 14:09:33 <daniels>	(jk)
Feb 18 14:09:57 <daniels>	but, seriously, working with the system and trying it out is very important to us for other projects
Feb 18 14:09:57 <allen>	i know you're broke.  what about some RICO cash?
Feb 18 14:10:16 <daniels>	in other words i'm sure we could fund a trip
Feb 18 14:10:43 <daniels>	but we wouldn't have needed to do this if these problems occured in feb 2nd when the shipment was due!!!!!!!
Feb 18 14:11:13 <daniels>	so hoe many hours are left
Feb 18 14:11:54 <allen>	technical problems would have been the same.  
Feb 18 14:12:23 <allen>	we are roughly half way through, flight hours and time in the field
Feb 18 14:12:25 <daniels>	but we would have lots of knowledgeable people and expertise for quite a while!?!?!
Feb 18 14:12:34 <daniels>	anyway, water under the bridge
Feb 18 14:12:50 <allen>	yes.  what now?
Feb 18 14:13:08 <daniels>	again, i would still like to talk to tech support to see how feasible a fix is --- brandon, is gary coming online?
Feb 18 14:13:59 <allen>	I need some lunch.  back in 20 minutes?
Feb 18 14:14:21 <allen>	will give you guys time to talk to the tech reps
Feb 18 14:14:27 <daniels>	i have ameeting at 230, so i will try to just talk to tech support. thx
Feb 18 14:15:13 <allen>	try and talk directly to Gary.  you will get a filtered version from the sales rep.
Feb 18 14:17:27 <daniels>	anyone in huatulco?  we are having them set up a conference call with us
Feb 18 14:19:29 -->	satcom (~8075503c@linus.atd.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 18 14:19:34 <satcom>	test
Feb 18 14:21:09 <satcom>	this is mike
Feb 18 14:21:16 <--	satcom has quit (CGI:IRC 0.5.2)
Feb 18 14:21:56 <daniels>	anyone in huatulco
Feb 18 14:21:58 <daniels>	?
Feb 18 14:22:00 <brandon>	We are going to be talking with John Baker, their Fullfillment Manager at 800.268.8594 x209
Feb 18 14:26:00 <allen>	i'm still here.
Feb 18 14:26:25 <allen>	larry left for food
Feb 18 14:28:15 <daniels>	i have the number for someone at skycasters
Feb 18 14:28:27 <daniels>	what is the signal strength?
Feb 18 14:28:40 <daniels>	are there any radars or radar detectors around?
Feb 18 14:28:41 <allen>	larry knows.  not here
Feb 18 14:29:02 <daniels>	from my discussion with him, there is no problem with the coverage in that area
Feb 18 14:29:07 <allen>	no. we are on the roof with a clear field of view to the SE
Feb 18 14:29:17 <daniels>	he is curious as to why the settings had to be changed
Feb 18 14:29:34 <daniels>	i know you've explained all this before---
Feb 18 14:30:05 <daniels>	but he said he has lots of experience with these units and is the person our account representative recommends
Feb 18 14:30:28 <allen>	he should talk to Gary.  everyone is confusing the issue.  the settings changed did not have anything to do with the lock.
Feb 18 14:31:09 <daniels>	when will larry be back?  was anyone else involved?
Feb 18 14:31:10 <allen>	LArry worked with gary each step of the way.
Feb 18 14:31:41 <allen>	john cowan was working on it too.  he is back in Denver
Feb 18 14:32:03 <daniels>	i understand and this is not intended to question larry
Feb 18 14:32:48 <daniels>	this guy was just very surprised that any of these setting had to be changed
Feb 18 14:33:15 <daniels>	i mentioned the dish pointing controls
Feb 18 14:33:28 <daniels>	which is what you said in your message
Feb 18 14:34:43 <allen>	it would not lock on automatically.  we had to run various calibration tests on the system
Feb 18 14:35:16 <allen>	finally tweaked it to the pooint where it would lock on.
Feb 18 14:35:56 <daniels>	he said that at one point you were receiving a signal strength of 88?
Feb 18 14:35:56 <allen>	started working on the interface with the data center.  thought things were good.
Feb 18 14:36:27 <allen>	i believe that is correct.  we are looking for larry now.
Feb 18 14:38:12 <daniels>	btw, I think it will be important to document everything -- contracts may need this
Feb 18 14:43:11 <--	jtanner has quit (CGI:IRC)
Feb 18 14:43:37 <daniels>	allen, can i get a phone number for you down there?  I'm going to call them and then try and do a conference call w/Larry

Feb 18 14:53:23 <daniels>	it just covers us in case we need to get our money back
Feb 18 14:54:29 <allen>	OK.  All details were verbal over the phone.  We will write a report documenting our actions and the communications.
Feb 18 14:54:50 <allen>	Could come down to he said / she said
Feb 18 14:55:18 <daniels>	what is you #?
Feb 18 14:55:29 <daniels>	you=your

Feb 18 14:56:18 <allen>	Use 011 52 958-589-3430  ... that is the cell phone in the data center.  best wait for larry. 
Feb 18 14:56:20 <daniels>	the guy we need to talk to is on the east coast and he leaves the office 6pm eastern
Feb 18 14:56:33 <allen>	working on it
Feb 18 14:56:35 <daniels>	ok, i will wait for larry
Feb 18 14:56:55 <allen>	what happened to your meeting/
Feb 18 14:57:10 <daniels>	i moved it again
Feb 18 14:57:23 <daniels>	it was just between me and santiago
Feb 18 14:57:36 <allen>	86 bucks a day and I get 2 bananas and and apple for lunch
Feb 18 14:57:51 <daniels>	really? how come?
Feb 18 14:57:55 <daniels>	you were late?
Feb 18 14:58:16 <allen>	talking to you guys.
Feb 18 14:58:49 <daniels>	ok, i guess i "owe" you a philly cheese
Feb 18 14:59:13 <allen>	we have located larry.  will be here is 15 minutes.
Feb 18 14:59:34 <daniels>	ok, i will plan to get this guy and him on the phone.
Feb 18 15:00:55 <--	brandon has quit (CGI:IRC)
Feb 18 15:02:13 <daniels>	btw, rdp will be paying for this call out of THEIR BUDGET so don't ever say we didn't help you guys ;-)  talk all you want on our nickel
Feb 18 15:04:51 <allen>	it cost me money to receive incoming international calls on my cell phones
Feb 18 15:06:24 <daniels>	what sort of goofy plan did you get then?  you can get one that allows free incoming calls?  Also, do you have a landline?
Feb 18 15:07:40 <allen>	we have larry here now.  he's dripping on me
Feb 18 15:08:33 <allen>	if you want to try and reach me via the hotel system.  Be my guest.  abla espanjol
Feb 18 15:14:25 <allen>	ping 192.168.1.15
Feb 18 15:16:18 <daniels>	just a sec
Feb 18 15:16:49 <daniels>	you can't ping that address except from within your network, silly
Feb 18 15:17:03 <daniels>	that's what is known as a "private" ip address
Feb 18 15:17:17 <allen>	operator error
Feb 18 15:17:45 <allen>	slow link.  henry transfering imaging
Feb 18 15:17:54 <daniels>	however, if you ssh to linus i can grab your ip address from your login record
Feb 18 15:18:23 <allen>	please make call now.  larry here
Feb 18 15:18:38 <daniels>	john is away from his desk!
Feb 18 15:19:34 <daniels>	can someone ssh to linus.atd.ucar.edu
Feb 18 15:19:51 <allen>	why
Feb 18 15:20:18 <daniels>	you are connected via phone now, right?
Feb 18 15:20:31 <Ron>	Mike, I assume you mean someone from Huatulco is to ssh to linus.
Feb 18 15:20:35 <allen>	yes. dial up modem
Feb 18 15:21:04 <daniels>	Ron: yes, but then I checkedc and a few people had already connected.  i have their ip adress now
Feb 18 15:27:02 <allen>	we still working on this?
Feb 18 15:27:20 <daniels>	yes.  no answer from the guy.  need to try again in 5 min
Feb 18 15:28:20 <allen>	one more try. then have to wait for Larry's return to JeffCO
Feb 18 15:28:45 <daniels>	agreed
Feb 18 15:28:58 <allen>	we had an early start.... our fun meters are pegged
Feb 18 15:29:51 <daniels>	is there some sort of status page or whatever that describes the current settings?  might be handy to have this
Feb 18 15:31:51 <allen>	no.  on start up it would not take a Mexican zip code.  we had to initialize with lat and lon
Feb 18 15:32:31 <daniels>	so there was no built in gps i take it
Feb 18 15:33:18 <allen>	there is.  we don't know why it asks its location.  just does
Feb 18 15:36:51 <allen>	are we done here?
Feb 18 15:37:26 <daniels>	when does larry come back?
Feb 18 15:37:52 <daniels>	who is his replacement and has he been briefed?
Feb 18 15:38:48 <allen>	no one with his expertise.  really hands on training.  we are toast when he goes unless you want to send someone.
Feb 18 15:39:41 <allen>	larry leaves tomoorow morning.  already extended him once.
Feb 18 15:39:47 <daniels>	i won't send anyone until if/when i know there is a chance to fix it. 
Feb 18 15:39:59 <daniels>	then i guess we are done for now
Feb 18 15:41:00 <allen>	sounds right to me.  we have a flight scheduled for tomorrow if he wants to chat some more.
