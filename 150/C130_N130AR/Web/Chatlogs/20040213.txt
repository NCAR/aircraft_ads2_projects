Feb 13 08:16:18 <ADS-c130>	Darn, it was supposed to arrive today <g>.
Feb 13 08:16:25 <schanot>	anybody still on up there?
Feb 13 08:16:51 <ADS-c130>	Yeah we are still here.  I have to fix a head set.
Feb 13 08:17:16 <schanot>	Did Ken & Carl get the quikscat data?
Feb 13 08:18:04 <djamal-c130>	yes al we did thanks 
Feb 13 08:19:33 <ADS-c130>	Al I had two operstro opps today.
Feb 13 08:20:22 <schanot>	Please repeat
Feb 13 08:21:23 <ADS-c130>	Al, i had two mess ups today.  The Radar alt was turned on 10 min late and the big pump was  30 min late.
Feb 13 08:21:54 <schanot>	ok
Feb 13 08:23:40 <ADS-c130>	Starting 5000 foot run.
Feb 13 08:24:49 <ADS-c130>	All instrument appear to be doing well.
Feb 13 08:27:23 <ADS-c130>	Al, what flow rate should the SCAI pump be set at?
Feb 13 08:28:14 <ADS-c130>	Dropping down to low level again.
Feb 13 08:30:43 <schanot>	you can leave the pump setting where it's at.
Feb 13 08:31:52 <ADS-c130>	Ok. It is running 700 to 900 lpm.
Feb 13 08:32:56 <ADS-c130>	Starting low level leg for 1 min.
Feb 13 08:34:23 <ADS-c130>	Heading back up.
Feb 13 08:35:30 <ADS-c130>	Changeing track buy 5 degrees.
Feb 13 08:41:01 <ADS-c130>	Climbing up to 5000.
Feb 13 08:45:18 <sabl-c130>	level flight - waves in boundry layer at 1538
Feb 13 08:48:01 <ADS-c130>	Al, Kip wants to send a fax back to Jeffco.  It's for Bobby.  It would be 4 pages.  It will take down this sat link until it is done.  Do you want us to wait until we get back?
Feb 13 08:48:51 <ADS-c130>	Al, Is there a Fax machine in the ops center?
Feb 13 08:49:10 <ADS-c130>	Changing track to 193
Feb 13 08:49:54 <schanot>	No FAX here.  Hotel has one
Feb 13 08:50:40 <ADS-c130>	Okay, do you wanty us to wait until we get back to use the plane or can we send it now?
Feb 13 08:50:56 <ADS-c130>	Starting to drop down to low level.
Feb 13 08:52:57 <schanot>	John,this is Larry.. You can use the regular Satcom for the Fax and not worry about breaking the Iridium link.
Feb 13 08:53:40 <ADS-c130>	You sure Larry.  We lost the link when we faxed you ion the way down, that 15 page fax.
Feb 13 08:54:30 <ADS-c130>	Well, I say we give it a try so that we know in the future.
Feb 13 08:55:27 <schanot>	OK, If you already know that we lost data during that fax then it will probably happen again but this is the first that I have heard of that.
Feb 13 08:55:30 <ADS-c130>	Starting low level run.
Feb 13 08:56:32 <ADS-c130>	Ok, well lets try it again.  Maybe I was attributing it to the fax and it was not that.
Feb 13 08:57:04 <ADS-c130>	Climbing and changing track to 188.
Feb 13 08:57:36 <schanot>	So I guess that you just wait to send the fax, Al says.
Feb 13 08:58:58 <ADS-c130>	Ok.  I guess we will wait then.  If they lever the INS up we can do it from the ramp when we get back. Or Kip said he can send it from the hotel.
Feb 13 08:59:19 <schanot>	That would be best - Al
Feb 13 08:59:47 <ADS-c130>	I will pass that on to Kip then.
Feb 13 09:02:17 <ADS-c130>	We will do it from the ramp when we get back.  We will leave the ins up. Do we want to leave the data system up so we can test and see if it is effected?
Feb 13 09:10:12 <ADS-c130>	Deciding what tracks to do next.

Feb 13 09:17:54 <bruce>	Thanks.  Let me know if anything interesting happens.
Feb 13 09:18:37 <sabl-c130>	bruce, saw boundry layer waves during level flt @1538 & 1547
Feb 13 09:20:41 <ADS-c130>	Al nay update on the position of the Jet?
Feb 13 09:21:04 <schanot>	Looks like a decent case, if not spectacular.  give us a warning if your eta changes from 1400 Local
Feb 13 09:21:35 <schanot>	I'll see if quikscat has a new update
Feb 13 09:22:28 <ADS-c130>	Not yet.  We are shifting track to see if we can find the jet down here.  The waves have stopped and they are looking for a place to do the cross wind legs at.
Feb 13 09:22:48 <ADS-c130>	Thanks for checking quickscat.
Feb 13 09:27:25 <schanot>	nothing new on quikscat.  no good coverage of the target area since previous plot
Feb 13 09:27:50 <ADS-c130>	Ok, thanks for looking.
Feb 13 09:29:54 <schanot>	if the case is looking marginal, maybe they could throw in a reverse track transect at the same altitude for winds QA

Feb 13 09:32:48 <cockpit-c130>	Allen: Carl; do you want up/down wind or cros wind? at 100 feet?
Feb 13 09:35:56 <schanot>	either is fine if they fly it as a reverse heading and let the plane drift.  Altitude not that important.  maybe on of your mid altitude
Feb 13 09:35:59 <schanot>	transects

Feb 13 10:23:57 <daniels>	Well, OK Mr. Smartypants :-)  what about the contents,then, or do I need to be even more specific?
Feb 13 10:24:11 <daniels>	Any Jody and Janet leave at what time tomorrow?
Feb 13 10:24:24 <schanot>	This does us little good, so we asked to have it at the airport gate at 0700 tomorrrow.
Feb 13 10:24:35 <ADS-c130>	Starting 500 leg.
Feb 13 10:25:54 <schanot>	Janet and Jody depart for the airport around 10 AM.  if we're really lucky we'll have them to try and help us for a couple of hours.

Feb 13 10:29:24 <daniels>	Al, that's good re: chat.  So I wonder if it did have to do with the number of variables sent down.  Janet?
Feb 13 10:29:54 <jtanner>	Hi Mike!
Feb 13 10:30:19 <daniels>	Jody, so just how brown and tan are you?
Feb 13 10:30:32 <ADS-c130>	Chat is much more stable now then in AIRS2.
Feb 13 10:30:37 <jtanner>	Not too much.
Feb 13 10:31:10 <daniels>	ADS-c130: Glad to hear that.
Feb 13 10:31:18 <schanot>	we had problems with the phone during ground tests at JeffCO.  spare was with Brigitte in Mexico.  couldn't confirm cause.
Feb 13 10:31:32 <daniels>	Iridium phone?
Feb 13 10:31:47 <schanot>	si
Feb 13 10:32:02 <ADS-c130>	Kurt sent that phone back for repair.
Feb 13 10:32:41 <daniels>	OK.  I can't remember if I told you or not but I did have success using my GSM phone down in Mazatlan.  BB is planning to try a GSM phone in Antigua.
Feb 13 10:33:36 <daniels>	Jody: office moves are happening as planned.  You should be able to have a nice window when you get back!
Feb 13 10:33:53 <schanot>	any news on getting a broker for the NAME shipment into Mexico?  I don't think they can afford the delay of the ransom.
Feb 13 10:33:56 <ADS-c130>	Starting 1000 leg.
Feb 13 10:34:34 <daniels>	I know they are discussing the NAME shipment alot right now.  They are looking at a different entry point into Mexico the last I heard.
Feb 13 10:34:59 <daniels>	We had a RICO meeting yesterday.  New option for places to stay on Antigua.
Feb 13 10:35:28 <schanot>	I'll leave that in Jorgen's hands
Feb 13 10:35:42 <daniels>	Two bedroom villas, but at $200/night they request that people double up.  From the pictures, these are very. very nice though.
Feb 13 10:36:09 <daniels>	yes, jorgen was also there.
Feb 13 10:36:20 <schanot>	ahoy C-130.  Still on the planned schedule?
Feb 13 10:38:48 <ADS-c130>	Not sure.  It looks like me might be able to fly into that restricted zone so that might change things up a bit.
Feb 13 10:39:22 <ADS-c130>	Completed 1000 run setting up for 5000 then moving to stack A I think.
Feb 13 10:39:46 <schanot>	roger that/  we plan to head for the airport around 1300 local.  let us know if you plan on stretching things out/
Feb 13 10:40:12 <ADS-c130>	The Commander of that airbase is onboard today.
Feb 13 10:40:36 <ADS-c130>	I will once we have an idea.  I think we ar 
Feb 13 10:40:55 <schanot>	it's always who you know!
Feb 13 10:40:56 <ADS-c130>	I think we are running a bit ahead right now but I'm not sure.
Feb 13 10:41:53 <ADS-c130>	Aint that the truth.  He comes back here, wants to see the restricted zone they say that if we want we can go into it today.
Feb 13 10:42:46 <ADS-c130>	They gave him a hat maybe that helped out <g>.
Feb 13 10:44:18 <ADS-c130>	Ken will give me an update on the time here in a bit.  He understands about letting you know before you leave the hotel.
Feb 13 10:46:03 <bruce>	Mike, any changes in the marine bl depth does it still look shallow compared to previous flights?

Feb 13 10:55:39 <ADS-c130>	Daniels, what does that do?
Feb 13 10:56:32 <daniels>	it's a way to bring up a separate chat channel for a two-way discussion.  there are a whole bunch of IRC commands and options, but I just haven't had time to describe all of them yet...
Feb 13 10:56:51 <daniels>	but query is a way to set up a two way conversation...
Feb 13 10:57:08 <djamal-c130>	Actually the mexican air force guy onboard said he is the 2nd commander of that base 
Feb 13 10:58:38 <ADS-c130>	Okay, so it is like a second chat area but just for two people.
Feb 13 10:59:06 <daniels>	yes, that's right.  it can come in handy so as not to clog up this channel...
Feb 13 10:59:56 <schanot>	yeah .. and you certainly are a BIG clog
Feb 13 11:00:45 <ADS-c130>	Looks like we will be done and landing about 1350 to 1400L.  They are going to try and do a reverse heading for you Al.

Feb 13 11:05:56 <ADS-c130>	Mike D. is there a site that has all the chat commands?
Feb 13 11:06:17 <daniels>	you can do a google search for "IRC commands" and there are lots of them
Feb 13 11:06:20 <schanot>	they've got to let you have alittle fun when you're doing this kind of work.
Feb 13 11:06:23 <ADS-c130>	Doing 1000 leg.
Feb 13 11:06:41 <ADS-c130>	Wait not in a leg yet.
Feb 13 11:06:46 <daniels>	the chat server we are using is just a standard irc server so most every command should work
Feb 13 11:07:07 <ADS-c130>	Hey I think this is great.  It keeps me from getting sleepy.
Feb 13 11:07:36 <ADS-c130>	I think I will try and get a set of caommands for the plane.
Feb 13 11:07:42 <daniels>	another thing that may help in some occasions is creating another chat channel, like what the dropsonde guys did in BAMEX
Feb 13 11:08:40 <ADS-c130>	It might, but we are not doing much with this yet.  They are using the i cs a lot this time though.
Feb 13 11:08:40 <Ron>	What, edit chat.  I can't do that!
Feb 13 11:09:24 <ADS-c130>	Ohhh and here I thought Ron was just a logger bot.  Oopss is a real OP.

Feb 13 11:12:58 <ADS-c130>	Yeah, he is trying out for the RICO crew.  But getting him to say Cleveland would be tought <g>.
Feb 13 11:13:32 <daniels>	i was in Cleveland!!
Feb 13 11:14:14 <daniels>	ok, but only for three days
Feb 13 11:14:19 <ADS-c130>	HMM, I don't seem to remember that.  I guess my brain is still thawing out.

Feb 13 11:15:55 <ADS-c130>	Dropping to 1000.
Feb 13 11:19:07 <schanot>	why are you snaking around on the northerly leg?
Feb 13 11:19:40 <ADS-c130>	Corrwecting for drift I think.
Feb 13 11:20:14 <ADS-c130>	There is a lot of confusion today.
Feb 13 11:20:41 <schanot>	it is definitely more humid today.  we saw contrails off your props when you took off.

Feb 13 11:21:39 <ADS-c130>	That is always a neat sight.
Feb 13 11:21:47 <ADS-c130>	Turning to start cross wind legs at 1000.
Feb 13 11:23:55 <bruce>	Mike S.  Any last comments before we head out to the airport?
Feb 13 11:24:33 <ADS-c130>	Looking to do legs at 500, 300, 200, 100 then to 3000.
Feb 13 11:24:44 <sabl-c130>	see you soon
Feb 13 11:24:50 <ADS-c130>	Al do you want just a reverse heading manuver?
Feb 13 11:26:12 <--	bruce has quit (CGI:IRC (EOF))
Feb 13 11:26:14 <schanot>	that is my primary concern.  usually not much change in pitch and sideslip.  just a RH would be fine this time
Feb 13 11:27:03 <ADS-c130>	Ok, I will pass that on the the flight crew. Will 3000 be a got altitude for you?
Feb 13 11:27:17 <ADS-c130>	End of run dropping to 500.
Feb 13 11:28:39 <schanot>	3000 is fine.  staying in the range of the NASA scanner, 1200 ft?, would also work.
Feb 13 11:29:18 <ADS-c130>	Ok, I will give them that option. Thanks Al.
Feb 13 11:31:34 <ADS-c130>	Al, do you want 2 or 4 minute legs on the RH?
Feb 13 11:31:57 <--	daniels has quit (Leaving)
Feb 13 11:32:08 <ADS-c130>	Starting 500 leg.
Feb 13 11:32:25 -->	daniels (~daniels@vpn37.ucar.edu) has joined #C130Q
Feb 13 11:32:48 <daniels>	whoops.  hey, did i miss something or does ION automatically refresh its display now?
Feb 13 11:33:12 <schanot>	how about four minute legs for good statistics
Feb 13 11:33:35 <ADS-c130>	We will do 4 min legs then.
Feb 13 11:33:55 <schanot>	no Mike.  what are you smoking?
Feb 13 11:34:25 <daniels>	can't say.  I thought this green part of the flight track was something new...
Feb 13 11:35:18 <daniels>	well, anyway, nice chatting with you all.  Pls let me know how the satellite setup is going!  adios!
Feb 13 11:35:34 <ADS-c130>	That is new it is the last 5 minutes of data.  It still needs to be manually refreshed though.
Feb 13 11:36:16 <ADS-c130>	Janet did that in AIRS because we could not tell where the plane was as it flew over old tracks.  Nice feature yes?
Feb 13 11:36:28 <daniels>	yes, nice feature!
Feb 13 11:37:17 <--	daniels has quit (Leaving)
Feb 13 11:39:44 <ADS-c130>	End of leg. Turning and dropping to 300.
Feb 13 11:43:09 <--	jtanner has quit (CGI:IRC (EOF))
Feb 13 11:43:38 <ADS-c130>	Starting 300 run
Feb 13 11:44:15 <schanot>	dropping off laudry enroute so i will be departing chat soon.  any last issues?
Feb 13 11:44:43 <schanot>	Janet will still be on and can reach me by phone if something comes up later.
Feb 13 11:45:25 <ADS-c130>	Ron, is the chat log an ASCII file? Do the researchers have access after the project to them?
Feb 13 11:46:12 <ADS-c130>	Okay Al.  We will see you when we land.
Feb 13 11:47:07 <Ron>	Chat log is an ASCII file.  I have yet to split it up into dated files.  I can do that sometime today and add an OW web page for viewing.  There is an editing issue if they are world readable.
Feb 13 11:48:09 <ADS-c130>	I think they are looking to use it for event markers.  I try to keep it clean enough for the world to read <grin>.
Feb 13 11:48:29 <schanot>	i'm gone
Feb 13 11:48:33 <--	schanot has quit (CGI:IRC)
Feb 13 11:48:39 <ADS-c130>	Buy Al.
Feb 13 11:48:57 <ADS-c130>	End of leg. Dropping to 200.
Feb 13 11:51:53 <ADS-c130>	Staring leg.
Feb 13 11:57:01 <ADS-c130>	End of leg. Turing and dropping to 100.

Feb 13 12:01:31 <ADS-c130>	Starting 100 leg.
Feb 13 12:06:38 <ADS-c130>	End of leg continuing on for a bit at 100.
Feb 13 12:09:33 <anstett>	Teresa, what is the name of the person you are expecting email from?
Feb 13 12:09:47 <anstett>	Sam wants to know.

Feb 13 12:12:55 <ADS-c130>	Leg finished climbing to 3000.
Feb 13 12:13:20 <anstett>	John, can you ask Teresa who she is expecting email from, Sam wants to know, Thanks.
Feb 13 12:13:53 <ADS-c130>	Janet, it is Erik Richard.

Feb 13 12:17:07 <ADS-c130>	Your welcome.  I got that question about 4 times <g>.
Feb 13 12:18:13 <anstett>	Well I think I sent it 3 times, once before I got disconnected, once it didn't appear in the chat window, and once after I reconnected.
Feb 13 12:18:28 <anstett>	I did get your reply 4 times, though.
