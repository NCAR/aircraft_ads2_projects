#  Notes:  Create a copy of, modify and run this script from a project's 
#            "Production/archive" subdirectory.
#          IMPORTANT:  Use the "tarit.docs" script to create an archive
#            file for the project's documentation in the "Production/docs"
#            subdirectory.

#   1.  Directory structure for projects is $LOCAL/proj/<3-digit project #>
#           having a "Production" subdirectory
#   2.  Project's name (only its name!) is in the file
#           $LOCAL/proj/<3-digit project #>/ProjectName
#   3.  A "proj.info" file exists in the project's "Production" subdirectory
#
#  Get setup information for this project

#  At this point one needs a list of files immediately under the above "tar
#   command.  As a starting point, one can use the `vi' command:
#                       !!ls ../..
#   to get a list of files in the project's home directory then edit out the
#   unneeded ones.  
#  For the Production subdirectory, one can use this command:
#                       !!ls ..
#  For a subdirectory under Production (e.g., archive), one can repeat this:
#                       !!ls ../archive
#                       !!ls                  (for this specific example)
#  For a subdirectory off the project's home directory, use a command like:
#                       !!ls ../../<directory>
#   (Execute these commands starting with the cursor at the first "#" line
#    below the `tar' command.  The `vi' command `!!ls' replaces the current
#    line with its output.)
#  Other subdirectories also may have files that need to be archived.
#  Remember that the `tar' command actually runs in the Project's home
#  directory, so references need to be made from that path.  After you get
#  the list of files, don't forget to add the subdirectory name (if any) to
#  the beginning of each file name and add a trailing <space> and backslash
#  (\) to each file name (except the last one), so the `tar' command gets
#  the entire list of files.
#
#  Brief summary for standard project files:
#      (project's home directory)
# !!ls ../..
#      (Production subdirectory)
# !!ls ..
#      (Production/archive subdirectory)
# !!ls
#
#   filter out undesired files
#   prepend appropriate subdirectory to affected file names
#    (remember that root path is project's home directory)
#   Add backslash at end of each line (except last)
#   Save and exit
#
#
# Production/docs/ <-- archived separately via "tarit.docs" script
#
#  Get tar directory list for archiving
