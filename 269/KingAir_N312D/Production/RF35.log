Note:  This log file documents a NIMBUS run that was done to compare its
         processing output with GENPRO.  This particular flight had been
         processed on 22 September 1993 with a special version of GENPRO
         whose high-rate output was set to 25 sps (rather than the normal
         20 sps).  The referenced NIMBUS setup file has been copied into
         this directory for documentation purposes.
