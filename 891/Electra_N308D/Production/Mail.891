All,

It has been brought to my attention by several people both here
at RAF and at RSF that the news is rapidly spreading regarding
a possible decision to lower the per diem rate for the deployment
in Ireland.  Before too many more people get worked up about this,
I wanted to make sure that everyone has the most accurate information
at this time on this subject.

The idea of lowering the per diem was, in fact, mentioned
by ATD management yesterday in a meeting I had with
Dave, Brigitte, Wen-Chau Lee, and Michele Case.  I spoke with
Brigitte this afternoon to find out the exact status of this
proposal, and I have been informed that it is NOT definite that
the per diem will be lowered.  It is one idea that Dave is considering
in order to lower some of the costs of the FASTEX deployment, and
he will be discussing this possibility with Cliff Jacobs during
meetings this week back in D.C.

I know there are serious concerns about this idea here at the
RAF (as there are in RSF, witnessing the number of email messages
and phone calls I've received on this topic so far today), and
I share the same concerns as everyone else.  I have requested
from both Dave and Brigitte that, before any action or firm
decision is made on this issue, Wen-Chau Lee and I be given the
chance to give our input on the idea and to represent RAF and RSF concerns
on this topic.  Brigitte is hoping to have more information on this
idea by the end of this week and will let me know as soon as she
gets any more word from Dave.

In the mean time, I would ask that people please try and not get
too worked up about this issue and that we all try and refrain
from too much speculation.  As I said, I share everyone's concerns
about this and will do my best to make sure that these concerns
are accurately and fairly represented to Dave before a final
decision is made.

Ron,

Just to keep you in the loop.  this has to do with a summary file for
aircraft state variables in the upcoming FASTEX project.

Hi everyone !

I have received a notification from UofC credit union saying that the use 
of their VISA card is suspended in Europe because of fraud. After 
inquiring with First Bank the issuer of the corporate VISA credit card, 
it appears that the suspension of VISA credit card use in Europe is NOT 
general and pertains only to those issued by U of C credit union. If you 
have the corporate VISA card you still can use it in Irland.

For those going to Ireland I have found the best rate for AT&T calls FROM 
the US to Ireland.  It's called the WORLD DEAL PLAN and it gives you the 
rate of .42 per min 24 hours a day when calls are placed from the US to 
Ireland.  It costs $3 per month and is good for 6 months but we don't 
need that much <grin>. The standard rate goes from .92 to 1.62 per min 
for calls from the US.

I called 1-800-222-0300 to set it up.

All,

It occurred to me (only today...sorry, I'm a little bit slow) that
for the past couple of weeks I've been trying to send weekly
status updates to the RAF staff regarding the status of the Electra
here at FASTEX, but since I've been using the wrong email alias,
none of you folks have probably been receiving them.  My apologies.

Given below are copies of the status reports for the first three weeks
of the Electra deployment for FASTEX.  This will, hopefully, give
every one back at Jeffco an idea of how the project has been going to
date.  And again, I'm sorry it took me so long to catch this oversight.

Also, by now I'm sure that everyone back at the RAF had heard of the
decision to ground the Electra after it was discovered that the funds
from the French had not, in fact, been received.  Following a phone
conversation yesterday (1/24) afternoon between Bob Serafin, Warren
Johnson, and Peter Hildebrand, the Electra has been returned to flight
status.  This decision will take place immediately and will be in effect
until further notice.  Research flight four is presently planned for
this evening, with a takeoff time of 9:00 p.m. scheduled.

Should any of you have any questions after looking over the following
summaries, please do not hesitate to email me.

See you all in a couple of weeks!

Krista

*******************************************
FASTEX WEEKLY UPDATE #3
*******************************************
All --
 
This weekly update is arriving a little bit later than the
previous two, primarily due to the fact that Electra activity
has been a bit slow here for the past several days due to
unsuitable weather conditions/case studies for flying.  What
follows is a brief summary of the Electra status to date:
 
--------------------
FLIGHT HOURS SUMMARY
--------------------
 
RF03 was flown yesterday (Wed., 1/22/97).  This was a general
systematic survey type mission flown with the P-3 and the UKMO
C-130.  (The C-130 aborted their mission earlier than planned,
however, due to problems with their dropsonde system.)  A total
of 7.0 hours were flown by the Electra.  It should also be noted
that a brief test flight was flown on 1/16/97 in order to give
the ELDORA support staff an opportunity to try and isolate some
of the problems that they had been encountering with the radar
during RF01 and RF02.  The flight hour summary for the Electra
is, therefore, presently as follows:
 
Research hours flown to date:  21.7 (including the test flight
                               flown on 1/16/97)
Research hours remaining:      64.3
 
RF04, planned for this evening, was cancelled at approximately
noon today.
 
------------------------------
INSTRUMENTATION STATUS SUMMARY
------------------------------
 
As of this writing, there are no new or significant instrumentation
problems to report.  The radome left temperature probe still
exhibits the problem of "saturation" during flight segments through
heavy cloud and/or precipitation areas.  (I.e., the TTRL and ATRL
traces drop out temporarily; this behavior was seen again during
RF03 flown yesterday.)  However, once the instrument dries
out, it returns to normal operational behavior and gives data that
are in agreement with values obtained from TTRR and TTFH.
 
ADS-2 continues to perform very well, and no major problems have
been encountered with the Electra data system during any of the
flights.
 
Some small problems have been encountered with ELDORA during the
flights here.  While specific details on these problems should
be obtained from Wen-Chau Lee, my understanding is that these
problems presently consist of a ground location problem, as well
as intermittent problems with "failure" messages on the various
systems.  The RSF technicians and engineers are still working
to isolate the cause of these problems, but none of the problems
have, to date, prevented us from flying.  Again, exact details
on these problems are available from Wen-Chau Lee.
 
 
That's all for now.  Should anyone have any questions, please do
not hesitate to email me.

FASTEX WEEKLY REPORT #1
****************************************

> -------------------
> GENERAL INFORMATION
> -------------------
> 
> The Electra arrived safely here in Shannon this past Saturday,
> 4 January at approximately 3:00 p.m. local (GMT) time.  Sunday,
> 5 January was a hard down day for all RAF flight crew members
> and Mike Daniels in order to get everyone rested up for the
> start of the project.  The NOAA P-3 and Gulfstream IV arrived
> safely on Saturday, 4 January, also.
> 
> Today (Monday, 6 January) was designated a maintenance day on
> the Electra in order to give the maintenance staff and technicians
> an opportunity to address a few minor problems encountered
> during the ferry from Jeffco to Ireland.  In general, the Electra
> has arrived for FASTEX in very good shape, from both a maintenance
> and an instrumentation standpoint.  Specific problems that needed
> to be addressed today are as follows:
> 
> 
> 1)  The left ("stubby") Lyman-Alpha needed to be replaced.  Tests/
> comparisons with the second Lyman-Alpha this afternoon show that
> the two instruments now compare very well.  Further assessment of
> the data quality will be carried out during the first research
> flight (more on this below).
> 
> 2)  The dewpointers needed to be cleaned, primarily due to material 
> that collected on both instruments when the Electra was de-iced
> in Maine.
> 
> 
> Two offices have been made available to RAF, RSF, and UCLA staff
> working here at FASTEX:  one for data processing and quality
> analysis, and the other for use by the RAF pilots, technicians, and
> mechanics and the RSF technicians and engineers.  Mike Daniels has
> finished setting up the two RAF workstations (Marley and Finster)
> here in our office, and we are successfully linked up with the
> main FASTEX server (central) being supported by RDP.  Some work
> still remains to be done to give the techs, mechs, pilots, and
> engineers Internet access in their office, but Mike is making very
> good headway toward getting this done.
> 
> So far, the network link that has been established via the
> University of Limerick is quite good, although at some points
> during the day, connections back to the U.S. can be quite slow
> (presumably during those times that lots of data transfers, etc.
> are going on here at the FASTEX Ops center).  As a general note to
> RAF staff back at Jeffco, all RAF staff in the field here for
> FASTEX have an account here on central, and email can be sent
> to us here at the following email address:
> 
> 
> [Staff member's last name, first 8 characers]@central.fastex.ul.ie

> 
> The primary problem that we have encountered to date here in the
> data processing office stems from a very touchy ground fault circuit
> system here in the terminal building where we are housed.  Not
> plugging computers and other equipment into the wall outlets in
> the appropriate fashion causes the circuit breakers to pop (to date,

Chris,

Krista told me that you are trying to recover as much data as possible from
the FASTEX RF04 tape.  When you have that job done (which is, I hope, soon),
I'd like to archive all the data to the SCD Mass Store System.  I have
already finished archiving the raw ADS data from all the other flights.

Please let me know.

Thanks.

Dick and Krista,

Just a short note to let you know that I have archived to the SCD Mass Store

The ExaByte-reconstructed tape for RF04 is on its way to ML, and I plan to
get its data archived before week's end.  Chris told me that ExaByte took
care of the bad blocks (1K byte in size) by replacing them with some fixed
data pattern.  This will produce bad data that we'll have to deal with
when processing the flight, but Chris, apparently thinks these blocks
do not cause NIMBUS to die.  However, the ADS image size in /home/data
(192 Mbytes) dumped from that tape, is much smaller than what ExaByte
wrote on a hand-written message on the tape (~600 Mbytes).

Ron,

Thanks for doing the archiving.

RE the small file size of the ADS image for RF04 on /home/data,
don't worry about that.  I believe that is the ADS image that I
ftp'd to Chris from Ireland, and it won't be the complete tape.
The bad data records on the tape caused the "dump to hard disk"
program to see the first bad record as an EOF.  Hence, not all
of the tape shows up in the ADS image.  So I'm inclined to believe
that Exabyte's note about 600 Mb is correct.

When the archiving is complete, can you please return all of the
tapes to me so that I can start on the processing?  Thanks.

Krista

I have all the tapes except RF04 will return them to you shortly.  To keep
from mounting tapes, you are welcome to use the MSS images.  I have updated
the local MSS master directory, so the "msget" scripts will work with those
bitfiles.

Krista and Dick,

Another short note to let you know that I have archived to the SCD Mass
Store System (MSS) the RF04 raw ADS tape for 1997-891 FASTEX.  It was the
reconstructed (by ExaByte) version of the original and has some 1k byte
blocks of erroneous data (where ExaByte "fixed" the bad sections).

I am not planning to archive the original master tape from this flight.

The tape should be back at Jeffco tomorrow at which time I'll give it to
you, Krista.

All --

A "post mortem" meeting to review the various aspects of the
deployment of the Electra for FASTEX has been scheduled for
1:00 p.m. on Wednesday, 2 April in the RAF conference room.
RAF staff involved with the support of FASTEX, RSF staff
involved with the ELDORA deployment, and RAF staff who wish to
listen in on the critique of the FASTEX deployment are invited
to attend.  For those staff who took part in the field deployment
of the Electra, please come prepared with any comments, concerns,
and/or suggestions for future aircraft deployments that you may
have.

See you on 2 April!

Dick and Krista,

I see that you are doing some preliminary NIMBUS processing of the FASTEX
data, so now that you have begun reviewing them prior to production, I thought
I'd see if you want to touch bases with me.

Since a new version of NIMBUS (rev 4.2.1, Nov 1996, March 1997) has been
released with some new features and bug fixes, and since the new ADS Reference
Manual (with its Chapter 5 covering NIMBUS) has been published, I made some
minor revisions to my brief Production Processing Procedures.  Rather than
make you go search for it, I have added a copy of it for you at the end of
this message.

If I can help you with your preparations or during production, please let
me know.

Thanks.

Ron

  Note:  Production processing is unique.  Do not use the `nimbus' login
          unless you are prepared to set up and perform production (final)
          processing.

 A)  The master raw ADS data tapes need to be archived to the SCD Mass Store
      System (MSS).  Make sure this is done before doing any production
      processing.  (See Ron for assistance.)
 B)  Peruse the entire project's data using quick-look tools.  Identify all
      changes that are needed for production processing.
   1)  Use whatever tools you want, including NIMBUS, ncplot, WINDS, PV-Wave,
        MATLAB, Xanadu, etc.
   2)  Make a list of instrument anomalies, failures, etc., that occurred
        during the project.
   3)  Make a list of equipment changes made during the project.
   4)  Edit the `Defaults' file in the project's directory
        (`hl proj/### ; vi Defaults') to make changes that reflect the
        typical flight.  (This file has reference constants used for
        making derived calculations.)
   5)  Make a list of per-flight changes needed for production.  Examples
        include:  new calibrations, reference variable substitutions, unique
        Defaults values.
   6)  Using information from B)5), create groups of flights which all need
        the same setup and whose processing will be identical.  (A group
        consists of one or more flights.)  Select one reference flight from
        each group.
   7)  If you use NIMBUS during this time, be sure to use your own login (not
        the `nimbus' login).  You may want to save setup files in your own
        processing directory.  (Make a list of those you want to recall for
        production processing.)
   8)  Completely summarize all the information needed for production
        processing (basically, all the above information); put it in a
        Project Production Setup document (or file); and send a copy to Ron.
        (Include the project's instrumentation list and ADS setup table.)
 C)  Set up NIMBUS for the default, low-rate processing (no matter what the
      final output rate will be).
   1)  Login as user `nimbus.'  See Chris Webster or Ron if you need the
        password.
   2)  Change to the project's directory (`hl proj/###'). 
   3)  Edit the `Production/FlightGroups' file to agree with B)6).  See Chris
        or Ron if you need help with this.
   4)  Edit the `DependTable' file to make changes that reflect the typical
        flight.  (This file determines the reference variables used for
        the derived calculations.)
   5)  If you will be doing high-rate processing later, make appropriate
        changes to the project's LowRateVars file, if necessary.  (This file
        determines which derived variables are to be unconditionally output
        at low rate.)
   6)  Please make sure that the project's VarDB file is up to date.  You
        may have to add and/or change extended definitions to the variable
        dictionary (using the command:  `vared VarDB').
   7)  Get the reference raw ADS data sets from the MSS.  One can use the
        "msget" or "msgetads" script for this.  If a data set is split into
        contiguous segments, retrieve all of them.  NIMBUS will process the
        entire flight as one output file by sequentially reading each ADS
        data set.
   8)  Run NIMBUS with each reference flight to create the reference setup
        files.  Refer to the ADS Reference Manual, Chapter 5, or the NIMBUS
        `walkthrough' document (located in the `nimbus' home directory), if
        necessary.
     a)  If present, load appropriate setup file from B)6) above, and check to
          make sure it makes no inappropriate changes.  (It can change rates,
          defaults, calibration coefficients, dependencies, variable output
          on/off.)  Multiple setup files can be loaded, one after another in
          case multiple changes are necessary.
     b)  From within NIMBUS, edit the Defaults file, if necessary.
     c)  Make appropriate changes to the calibration coefficients.
     d)  Make appropriate changes to the dependencies.
     e)  Carefully choose which variables are to be output to or omitted
          from the production netCDF file.
     f)  Be sure all output rates are correct.
     g)  Save the setup.  (You will not be asked for a setup file name,
          since, in production mode, it is predefined.)
     h)  Repeat for the next reference data set, if necessary.
 D)  Preproduction test
   1)  Make one production run using a representative flight.
     a)  The output data set will be put in the directory
          `/home/productiondata,' and its name will follow the prescribed
          naming convention:  ppptFnn[H].cdf  (Example:  120rf03b.cdf)
          where:  ppp = 3-digit project number
                    t = type of flight (f=ferry, r=research, t=test)
                   nn = flight number and possible segment letter
                         (e.g., 03b)
                  [h] = suffix letter to indicate high-rate data
                         (Example:  120rf03bh.cdf)
   2)  Peruse the production log file in the project's `Production'
        subdirectory created during the NIMBSU run.  (See Ron for help,
        if needed.)
   3)  Peruse the netCDF header.  (Use `ncdump -h <file> | more'.)
     a)  Make sure that the variable list is correct.
     b)  Make sure that no variable has "units" of "Unk" or "Unknown" and
          "long_name" of "No title".  If any do exist, repeat step C)8).
          (Within the `more' comand, use the `vi'-like command:  "/Unk" and
          "/No title" to find them.)
   4)  Review output data using ncplot, WINDS or other available tools.
   5)  Note changes that are needed to the processing, and rerun, if
        necessary.  Update the associated setup file.
   6)  Repeat this section using the reference example from each flight group.
 E)  Production
   1)  When all is ready for production, check available disk space to make
       sure that room exists for the processed data.  (You may have to do
       production runs in sections and have the output data archived before
       continuing.  Also, other project processing may compete for the
       available disk space which may require negotiation with other users.)
   2)  Use NIMBUS to process each flight/segment.
     a)  NIMBUS now has automatic output file naming, and if a flight has
          to be processed in segments, one must rename each output file to
          add the segment's letter, for example, 120rf05.cdf --> 120rf05a.cdf.
     b)  If necessary, rename the production log file for this segment, too.
          It will be located in the project's `Production' subdirectory.
     c)  Thoroughly peruse the output from each production run, looking for
          errors and things overlooked in setup.
     d)  When flight/segments have been processed to your satisfaction, have
          Ron archive the output files to the MSS.  (This may have to be done
          in sections if disk space is at a premium.)  It is recommended that
          all the low-rate files be archived before commencing with high-rate
          production processing.
 F)  If high-rate processing is required, repeat steps D) and E), but
      select the `high-rate' button in the NIMBUS window before starting
      the processing.
   1)  You may need to make alterations to the setup.  One example would be
        setting the output rates for variables like VEW and VNS to 10 sps.
        A separate and independent setup file could be loaded to make these
        changes (and set the "high-rate" flag, too).  (For an example, see
        the file `HRT.convert' in the `870/Production' directory.)
   2)  NIMBUS now has automatic production output file naming, so one should 
        not have to rename the low-rate output file to avoid overwriting
        extant data.
   3)  Check a representative sample of high-rate, processed data using
        appropriate tools.  (This may include spectrum analysis.)
 G)  When all data have been processed to your satisfaction and archived to
      the MSS, prepare the final documentation binder(s) for shipment to the
      Principal Investigator(s).
 H)  Determine the type of output product(s) needed by PI(s) and schedule RDP
      to copy and ship the output data.  (See Ron for instructions.)

Subject: Hepatitis A

Please be advised that two ATD employees have returned from Ireland and 
have been diagnosed with hepatitis A. An employee's wife, who was also 
in Ireland, may also have been affected. They are under physicians 
treatment. I have discussed the situation with both of our physicians 
(Dr. Brandt and Dr.Turnbow) as well as with the Boulder County Health 
Department (they contacted me first).  They all report that immune 
globulin shots are ineffective if given more than 14 days following 
exposure.  Since most employees left Ireland over 14 days ago, it 
appears there is little to be done at this time. I am working with ATD 
to identify potentially affected employees and will verify when they 
left Ireland.  If any have left within 14 days I will immediately refer 
them to our physicians for further treatment.

I propose the following:
1.  Identify all participants, both UCAR, NCAR and non-UCAR 
collaborators.
2.  Notify all participants of these developments and provide a 
technical overview and recommendations for hepatitis a.  I intend to use 
an information sheet developed by the Boulder County Health Department.
3.  I will ask for anyone who may have had symptoms to contact me and I 
will determine appropriate follow-up.

The Boulder County Health Department along with the Centers for Disease 
Control will be doing an investigation.  I will keep you advised of any 
special requests they have i.e. they may want data on ill employees such 
as where they stayed, ate, etc.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Regards,
s2

I'm getting ready to start stripping off the 2D data records from
the FASTEX data tapes for separate archiving, but before I proceed
I need a couple pieces of information from you.  First, can you
email the file size limitation for sending files up to the MSS?
I recall that, for SCMS, I had to split up some of the 2D data files
in order for you to be able to get them up to the MSS.  Second, can
you let me know what the Nimbus login is when you get a chance?

Thanks.

Krista,

This is a tricky question to answer.  The limit used to be 400 Mbytes, but
since the Mass Store limit has now been raised to 6 Gbytes, our MIGS limit has
now increased to 1 Gbyte.  We have never transferred files of this size from
Jeffco, so I'm not sure how successful it will be.  If you are willing to be
a guinea pig, we can try transferring large files.  If it fails, we can fall
back to something smaller.

One concern, right now is the amount of disk space available.  There is
plenty of room on "/home/productiondata" but not much in "/home/data"
or "/home/staticdata."  To use "/home/productiondata" you need to be
logged in as "nimbus."  I moved 4 of the FASTEX ads files and filled up
"/home/staticdata."  If you are hurting for space, we can always move
other stuff around, even to an ExaByte tape, if necessary.

> Second, can you let me know what the Nimbus login is when you get a chance?
The nimbus login is simply the user named "nimbus."  I'll give you the
password verbally if you need it.

Ron,

The first three 2D files for FASTEX are ready and are sitting
in /home/productiondata.  They are:

891rf01.2d
891rf02.2d
891rf03.2d

The file for RF01 is the largest, at around 438 Mb.  Why don't you
try archiving these on the MSS before I proceed with stripping
off the 2D data for the other flights and let me know if things
work okay.

Thanks.

As you can see, I am now the owner, but, since they have world write

with them.  If not, I can do it for you.

These files are now not subject to the scrubber and will remain here

Krista,

I have archived to the SCD Mass Store System the following stripped PMS-2D
data files:

         Source file name             MSS bitfile name       Size (Mbytes)
  /home/productiondata/891rf01.2d  /RAF/1997/891/PMS2D/RF01   438.461016

  /home/productiondata/891rf03.2d  /RAF/1997/891/PMS2D/RF03    69.696228

I had no problem with the file larger than 400 Mbytes.  I'm reasonably sure
that our present MIGS limit is 1 Gbyte, so you may proceed to generate the
other files, and I'll archive them when you're ready.

Okay, good.  I'm glad these big files aren't going to be a problem.

I'll go ahead and start on the other 2D data and will let you know
when the flights are ready to be archived.

Ron,

I'm starting to get more of the necessary materials ready for
the FASTEX data notebooks, and I need a couple of pieces of
documentation from you.  Can you prepare for me:

1)  A Production Mass Store Bitfile Log for the PMS-2D data
files you archived for me for FASTEX (document can have the
same format as the one you prepared for me for SCMS);

2)  An RAF netCDF Information Sheet (or just tell me where
it is on our system and I can print out a copy).

Thanks, in advance, for your help.

Krista

Krista,
You certainly may use that information file (netCDF.txt2) which you retrieved
from my home directory.  (I don't think it contains any misinformation, but I
have not read through it lately.)  However, if you want to use it, I direct
you to our published Web version which also has a sample header.  It's URL is:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Bulletins/b9appdx_D.html
Since you undoubtedly will include in the project summary binder an example
FASTEX netCDF header, this extra one may only be confusing, so use your best
judgment.

Quick question for you.....

When I do the FASTEX production processing, I'm going to edit
the flight numbers so that they are in a consistent format
across flights.  What have we decided is the format we're going
to use:  "RFxx" or "rfxx" (caps or lower-case)?

Krista,

Within the netCDF or raw ADS files I would prefer to see caps.  For
data files (mainly to ease typing), use lower case.  In production
mode (i.e., the "nimbus" login) example nimbus output names are
"891rf03.cdf" and "891rf03h.cdf" to indicate low-rate and high-rate
data, respectively.  A segment letter would immediately follow the
flight number.

Ron and Chris,

I've started the production processing for FASTEX, and I've
noticed something in processing RF01 that I wanted to ask you
both about.

I have DESPIKE enabled for SDWC1, SDWP1, TEP, and TET.  When
I run Nimbus, it finds the "despike" file no problem, but only
prints out the following message in the Nimbus window:

TEP: 114 spikes removed with slope exceeding 10.000000
TET: 410 spikes removed with slope exceeding 0.250000

It does not print out any such messages for the 2D probe shadow
OR variables.

It has done this to me both when I run Nimbus as myself and as
"nimbus," but in all cases, the code does seem to despike the
2D data as I want.

I guess this really isn't a big deal since the data are getting
despiked.  However, I'm just curious as to why no messages show
up for the two 2D variables in processing.  Also, there won't be
any 2D despiking messages to archive in the FASTEX production.log.lrt
file.  I can rectify this by adding my own such messages, but I
wanted to check with you both on this first before I continue on
with the processing.

Krista

Chris will have to answer this one.  I haven't studied that part of the

Krista,

In a recent upgrad to NIMBUS Chris has added a log file output for each
production run, so there is, perhaps, no need for you to maintain your
own production log file.  The information you have put in the file
"production.log.lrt" also appears in the file "logFile_LRT.1."

Ron,

Per our discussion last Friday, the "first run" of the final FASTEX
files are ready to be archived to the MSS.  Recall that these are
the files that have been generated using the Nimbus login but that
have not had a little bit of final chemistry processing done to them.

As we discussed, I would like to have these backed up on the MSS just
as a form of insurance before I finish applying the appropriate
chemistry corrections to them.  Please put them in a directory that
will not be readily accessible to users retrieving files from the
MSS (so that users do not inadvertently grab the wrong, final-release
files).

The files are all in /home/productiondata and follow the typical
naming convention (891rfxx.cdf).  Also, let me know if you change the
file names when you place them on the MSS.

I will let you know when the final data files are ready to go up to
the MSS.

Thanks!

Krista

Ron,

I'm trying to wrap up certain parts of the FASTEX data documentation
effort, and I still need copies of the 2D and raw ADS MSS Bitfile
reports from you for the notebooks.  If at all possible, can you
please get these to me by Wed., 28 May?  I leave for vacation on
29 May and am trying to get most (if not all) of the FASTEX work
wrapped up before I leave.  (I'll be back on 9 June).

Also, I'm waiting on some input from Greg and Dick F. before processing
of the LRT files can be completed.  I'll let you know as soon as those
files are ready.

Thanks.

Krista

Krista,

The raw ADS tape to MSS bitfile summary can be found as the file:
     /home/local/proj/891/Production/archive/tapes.891
Another raw ADS tape report (not useful to users) can be found in the file:
     /home/local/proj/891/Production/tp2ms.summary

I'm not exactly sure what you want in a 2D bitfile report.  I can give
you a MSS listing showing the bitfile path name and bitfile sizes.
Is there an example file somewhere that you would like me to mimic?

All,

The purpose of this email message is to give you a brief update 
regarding the status of the in situ and microphysical data collected
on the NCAR/NSF Electra during FASTEX.  Please note that the discussion
below focusses only on these data and does not include discussion of
the status of the FASTEX ELDORA data.

Processing of the data obtained on the Electra during the seven research
flights flown is almost complete.  All that remains is to "polish up"
and complete processing of some of the dewpoint and ozone data before
the final netCDF files can be officially released to the Mass Storage
System (MSS) here at NCAR.  The data documentation notebooks to accompany
these files will, after the addition of approximately two more documents,
also be ready for distribution.

In terms of scheduling, I will be out of the office on personal travel
from 29 May to 8 June 1997.  I will be back in the office on Monday,
9 June, and I anticipate that the FASTEX data processing and notebook
preparation will be completed within approximately two weeks of my return.
I will notify you all again by email when the data files are ready and
archived on the MSS.

Should any of you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact
me, either via email or by phone at 303-497-1031.

Best regards,

Krista

Krista,

Just thought I'd let you know that I'll also be on personal travel between
9 and 20 June, so I will probably be archiving the FASTEX data to the MSS
during the week of 23 June.  If that timetable doesn't suit you, I can show
you how to archive the files yourself and create a preliminary (but usable)
MSS bitfile log for the netCDF data.  In any case I'll archive the support
files after I come back.  (Please make sure that Chris doesn't release a
new version of the NIMBUS software, since I want to archive the version you
used, as well.)

If you can fill me in via email how to archive the files to
the MSS, that would be best.  I might try to get them archived
while you're gone, but I'm not going to have time to touch bases
with you on the archival process today before I leave.  I will
be checking my email periodically while I'm gone next week, so
you can just fill me in via email.  Otherwise, I guess we'll
have to wait until the week of 23 June.

Krista,

Here is the info to make an MSS Bitfile Log and for archiving production
netCDF files to the MSS.  If you wish, you may wait until my return, and
I'll do the work.  I provide this only in case you are in a time bind and
want to get things done pronto.  For these procedures to work, you must
have all the production netCDF files in the `productiondata' directory,
and they also must use the standard naming convention (i.e., the names
that NIMBUS gives them when running in production mode).


M A K E   P R O D U C T I O N   M A S S   S T O R E   B I T F I L E   L O G
- - - -   - - - - - - - - - -   - - - -   - - - - -   - - - - - - -   - - -

Log in as `nimbus.'
Change to the FASTEX Production directory:
     hl proj/891/Production
Enter the following command:
     gentl 891
  (Using the FASTEX output data files in the `productiondata' directory,
  assuming that they have standard names, this script will produce a bitfile
  log named `taplog.891,' in your current directory.  If any flights have
  segments, it will list them after the others.  If both high- and low-rate
  data files exist, it will have two separate sections.
If necessary, edit the resulting `taplog.891' file to put the entries in
flight numerical order.


A R C H I V E   P R O D U C T I O N   n e t C D F   D A T A
- - - - - - -   - - - - - - - - - -   - - - - - -   - - - -

Log in as `nimbus.'
Change to the FASTEX Production directory.
     hl proj/891/Production
Enter the following command:
     genar 891
  (Using the FASTEX output data files in the `productiondata' directory,
  assuming that they have standard names, this script will produce C-shell
  script in your current directory, named `arch.891,' having MIGS Mass Store
  copy commands.  It will have its execute permissions set.)
Run the script `arch.891,' and it will echo to your screen a series of
  "nrnet" commands to archive all the production netCDF files found.  If
  everything looks OK (i.e., the path and bitfile names are as they should
  be), edit the `arch.891' file to remove the leading "echo" words at the
  beginning of each affected line.  (If editing with `vi' you can use the
  following command:
     :%s/^echo //
Save and exit.
Logout as the `nimbus' login.
Login as yourself!  (IMPORTANT)
Using X windows, change to the FASTEX Production directory and run the
  `arch.891' script again.  It will echo to your screen the date and time
  followed by a series of Sequence numbers.  Please capture those lines
  with your mouse/track ball.
Again edit the `arch.891' script and insert the previously-captured lines as
  new lines of text at the end of the file.  (It has group write permission,
  so you should have no problem editing it.)  Save and exit.
Each sequence number corresponds to a MIGS job that will archive one netCDF
  file.  For each of these you will get an email message from MIGS telling
  you whether or not the MSS archive job was successful.  Please SAVE or
  forward to me every one of these messages.
(The reason you submit this script under your own login and not `nimbus' is
  that `nimbus' has no separate MIGS account.)

Have a nice vacation.

All --

Processing of the FASTEX Electra in situ data is complete, and the
final low-rate data files (in netCDF format) have been released and
archived to the NCAR Mass Store System (MSS).  Please note that this
release and archival pertains only to the Electra in situ data.
Questions regarding the availability of ELDORA data collected on the
Electra during FASTEX should be addressed to Wen-Chau Lee (303-497-8814
or wenchau@ncar.ucar.edu), the ELDORA project manager.

Preparation of the FASTEX Electra data documentation notebooks has
also been completed, and within the next few days, these notebooks
and certain supplemental materials will be sent out.  Distribution
of these notebooks and, in some cases, associated materials, will
be as follows:

Dr. Jacques Testud (Video tape copies to be included)
Dr. Roger Wakimoto (Video tape copies to be included)
Dr. Peter Hildebrand (Video tape copies to be included)
FASTEX Central Data Archive (G. Jaubert)
RAF Project Office

Descriptions of where the low-rate data files are located on the NCAR
MSS are included in the data documentation notebooks.  These notebooks
also include (among other items):  a data quality report, video tape
logs, project slides, relevant RAF bulletins, netCDF instructions, a
netCDF format example.  Users obtaining copies of these notebooks are
encouraged to look them over closely, as these notebooks provide a lot
of important supplemental information which will aid in the interpretation
and use of the Electra in situ data.

Users who wish to obtain copies of the low-rate Electra netCDF files
should direct all such requests to Ron Ruth, the RAF Data Manager (303-
497-1084 or ruth@ncar.ucar.edu).  It should be noted that high-rate
in situ Electra data will only be generated and distributed upon
request.  Should you wish to obtain such high-rate data, please direct
your request to Ron Ruth.

Should you have any questions or comments about the quality of the
in situ data, or should you discover any discrepancies in the data set
at any time during your perusal of the data, please contact me (Krista
Laursen) directly at 303-497-1031 or krista@ncar.ucar.edu.

It has been my pleasure to work with all of you during the course of
the FASTEX project.  I sincerely hope that the support provided to
FASTEX by the NCAR Research Aviation Facility has been satisfactory.
Should you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to
contact me.

Best regards,

Krista

Just wanted to pass along one other piece of info regarding the
netCDF files for FASTEX that have been archived....

Before archiving them, I noticed that the permissions on some
of the production files had changed to rw-rw-r- (i.e., both
Nimbus and other users could read and write to the files).  I'm
not sure why this changed for some of them, but I suspect that
it had something to do with the fact that I had to use ncmerge
on several of them to get the right data merged in.  At any
rate, I changed all of the permissions to rw for nimbus only
before sending them up to the MSS.

I've also created a backup "tar" tape of all of the files, just
in case there are any unforeseen problems.

Krista,

Should I archive the files "891o3fix_1t47.nimbus" and "891o3fix_6.nimbus" 
that are in the Project 891 directory?  If so, should they be write protected
and should the `nimbus' login own them?

Ron,

Genevieve Jaubert's email address is:

genevieve.jaubert@meteo.fr

When you email her RE the data request from OSU, you may also
wish to inquire if she would like us to send an 8 mm tape 
containing copies of all of the final netCDF data files.

Thanks!

No, don't worry about archiving those.  They are setup files
I used to correct the TEO3 cal. coefficients.  I've made the
necessary changes to the Flight_X files to do the processing
correctly in the future.

Krista and Dick,

Your comments in README.processing about RF07 and the filtered DPTC --> DPXC
worry me a bit.  DPTC = DPXC (uncorrected) was used as the NIMBUS processing
reference for EDPC, and EDPC was subsequently used as a dependency for
calculating MR, RHODT, RHUM, THETAE and THETAV.  Since the netCDF file is
supposed to be self-documenting, there is now a discrepancy that can only
be explained by a second, external, reference file.  I think it would have
been better to create a new, once-only variable name (e.g., DPTCF with
an appropriate VarDB long_name) and add it to this data set.  It would be
much less confusing for future users of the data when the extra reference
file does not accompany it.

Is it too late to make this change?

Ron,

The FASTEX request for Bosart at UCLA: does this represent the
quality-checked aircraft flight-level data?  I'm particularly
interested in whether this is the "best available" info on aircraft
position.

Thanks.

The answer is "yes."  It is RAF's final production low-rate data set
for FASTEX.

Genevieve,

RAF has finished its low-rate, production processing for the Electra, in-situ,
flight-level data for the FASTEX project.  These have been archived as netCDF
files here at NCAR on the SCD Mass Store System.  A log of this information
follows my message.  (Information regarding RAF can be found on the World
Wide Web at the URL http://raf.atd.ucar.edu.  Information on RAF's data 
can be found at the URL http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Bulletins/bulletin9.html.

Would you like a copy of all these data sent to you on an 8mm (ExaByte) tape
in tar format?  (Would you like to get it in some other way?)

Also I received a request for these data.  Does you group plan to distribute
all the FASTEX data from one central location?  Should I pass all data
requests to you, or should I take care of the Electra data requests I get?

In short, I do not know what policies are in place regarding the distribution
of FASTEX data.

Thanks for a prompt reply!

Ron,

  Thanks for the information concerning the Electra, in-situ, flight-level 
data for the FASTEX project.

  I will update the Electra WEB pages with these informations.

  A copy of all these data on an 8mm tape is fine for me.

  Both the NCAR/RAF and the FASTEX Central Archive distribute these data.

  The FASTEX Central Archive send the data to anyone who is registrated
as a FASTEX Archive user, and accept to apply the Data policy.
Each set of data have a specific data use.
  For the FASTEX specific instruments (aircraft, ship) the following
data use is applied:
----------------
According to the FASTEX data policy, the use of these data is unrestricted for
research and educational purposes.

Proper acknowledgements should be given in publications that utilize this data
to specific scientists and institutions that made the collection of data
possible.

Where appropriate, all authors considering publication of FASTEX related
research results should offer co-authorship to investigators who had a primary
role in the collection of data utilized in the study.
--------------------
  So, PI's, data providers and fundings have to be mentionned for each
sending of the data.

  It is possible to add something to the general data use, for each instrument.
Let me know if you want this for the Electra data.

Dick & Krista,

Following is the reply from Genevieve regarding my query to her yesterday.
We both will be distributing the Electra data.  She brought up the point of us
advising users to acknowledge data and funding sources and offer co-authorship
to participants.  I'm not sure how to add that to data we send out.   RAF or
RDP could include a cover letter or a small "README" file to include with the
data.  What do you suggest, and who should write this message?  I have not
reviewed (nor know where to find) the entire FASTEX data policy.  I didn't
see any reference to policy statements on the Meteo-France FASTEX home page.

I guess my own feeling on this is that a short cover letter
could simply be sent out with the data containing the pertinent
information.  As for who should write it, it seems to me that
you, as the RAF data manager, could be responsible for this.

Paul and Dick -- any other thoughts?

Krista,

I will write this letter, but I need the following information from you,
as FASTEX project manager, to comply with Genevieve's enumeration of the
FASTEX Data Policy:
 - Names, addresses (USPS and email) and phone numbers of institutions that
    made collection of RAF's data possible (i.e., funding agencies like NSF,
    others??);
 - Names, addresses (USPS and email) and phone numbers of investigators who
    had a primary role in the collection of the Electra data (i.e., all
    Electra PIs).

Thanks.

Dick and I just spoke about this (and I guess he already touched
bases with you, too).  Neither one of us believes that our
processing approach needs to be re-done, for two main reasons.
First, I have documented in the QC report that went out to the
PIs exactly how the dewpoint data were processed for RF07 and
to alert them to the fact that they want to use DPXC.  Second,
I, and I believe Dick, believe it would be more confusing to
add yet another dewpoint variable name to the file for RF07.
As I said, we have clearly explained to the users what we have
done, so they shouldn't be confused about which variable to use.

Thanks for your concern, however, on this matter.

Roger was funded by NSF via the deployment pool for his hours, but you'll
have to contact him directly to find out if any additional NSF grant
numbers applied toward him going into the field for FASTEX.  I outline
below where you can find his contact info.  The bulk of the hours were
paid for by the French.  I may have this info in a copy of the FASTEX
MOA.  If so, I'll put it in your box.  Otherwise, Joanne may be able
to track down the exact French contract numbers for you.

The three Electra PIs were Jacques Testud, Roger Wakimoto, and Peter
Hildebrand.  Names, addresses, etc. can be found in the cover letter
sent out in the data documentation notebooks to each of them.  You
can find this info in the RAF copy of the FASTEX notebook in Linda's
office.

Genevieve,

In your previous email message (See above.), you summarized some points
from the FASTEX Data Policy.  Would you please send me a complete copy of it
(preferably in English) or give me a URL (web site address) that would have
it?

If you were asking me whether we should apply the policy points you listed
above to the Electra data, I answer "yes" with one exception:  I don't think
that investigators need to offer co-authorship to primary investigators (PIs),
especially if the PIs did not participate in their research.  I would hope
that they would acknowledge and offer appreciation to the PIs for collecting
the data.

If you were asking me whether to add a further restriction to the Electra
data, in general, or for special instruments on the aircraft, I answer "no."

Thanks very much.

If you have not already received the 8mm ExaByte tape of the Electra data,
you should receive it very soon.  We shipped it from Boulder, Colorado
on 30 June 1997.

The URL is: http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr:8000/dbfastex/data_policy.html
It is also on page 116 of the "FASTEX Operations Plan"

  As it strikes me, the words 'where appropriate' answer to this case.
Or it is a language problemn. It it the case?

documentation. Thank you very much.
 Is the paper documentation - or some parts of it- available as an
electonic form ? (postcript file, MSWords file, ASCII file ...)

Genevieve,

Yes.  If we do not reformat any of the individual files, they will be
a mixture of WordPerfect, FrameMaker and ASCII.  If you cannot read
WordPerfect or FrameMaker files, we can reformat them to MSWord or
ASCII.

I can either make another 8mm ExaByte tape (tar format) with this information
and send it to you, or I can make the files available via anonymous ftp from
our computer here.  Which do you prefer?

Ron,

  If you can reformat the files to MSWord, it is perfect. I can get the files
via anonymous ftp.

Genevieve,

   I now have all the files ready for you to get via our anonymous ftp site.
In addition to all the individual files, I made one large "tar" file of all
the files in the directory in case you want to get them with one ftp command.

    method:  anonymous ftp (please use email address as password)
   machine:  raf.atd.ucar.edu
      path:  pub/fastex
     files:  README
             fastex.tar
             (see below for full listing)

   We were able to reformat all but one of the WordPerfect files to MSWord.
The "Research Flight Reports" file has a lot of tables that did not transfer
well.  As a result, I will put two versions of that file on our ftp site
for you, one as WordPerfect 6.1 and the other as an "in-progress" MSWord 7.0
file.  You may accept it as is or try to complete the reformatting job.  (When
converted to an ASCII file, it makes every table entry a separate line, which
I thought was unacceptable.)
   A README file (which I will add at the end of this message) lists all the
files along with a brief description of them.  The first part of the README
file lists the components of the Project Summary binder in the order they
appear.  The second part is a standard UNIX long file list.

Notes:
------
  1.  The ASCII files are saved in DOS format.
  2.  The PostScript files are level 2.
  3.  The *.doc files are in MicroSoft Word Version 7.0 format
  4.  the *.wp6 file is in WordPerfect Version 6.1 format

Ron,

Thanks for the FASTEX Electra documentation. I plan to send it with any of
the ELECTRA in-situ data request. So, I have modified the letter to make
the introduction of this documentation, each of its items been a chapter of the
documentation. The new file (in MS-Word 6.0) is joint to this email. Could
you said to me if you accept it, or if you propose some modifications?

A README file will also be sent with the data. In this README file, the PI's,
the data providers and the data policy will be mentionned.

There was a little mistake in your documentation package: the file named 
data_tap.doc is the copy of the data_qua.doca file. Could you send me the true 
data_tap.doc file ?

And what about the reflectivity radar composite maps? Are them processed?

Brigitte,

To your knowledge, has any FASTEX PI requested restricted access to any
aircraft data?  RAF received a request for some high-rate data that we
have yet to process.

Dear Genevieve,

I accept your modifications to make each item of our FASTEX Summary its own
chapter.  In the file you appended to my email message, I call your attention
to one sentence that has an extra character added to the word "documentation:"
 "Several items are enclosed in this documentationr and should be considered
  part of the RAF FASTEX data package."          -

I apologize that our "data_tap.doc" file was not correct.  If you are
willing to accept an ASCII file instead of a MSWord 7.0 version of it,
you may retrieve the file "data_tap.asc" from our ftp site.  Our word
processor had great difficulty translating the file "data_tap.wp6" from
WordPerfect6 format to MSWord 7.0.  The ASCII file lacks the fancy table
format of the original but retains all its information.  You may retrieve
the original WordPerfect6 file, too, if you wish.

    method:  anonymous ftp (please use email address as password)
   machine:  raf.atd.ucar.edu
      path:  pub/fastex
     files:  data_tap.asc
             data_tap.wp6

Regarding the reflectivity radar composite maps, you will have to contact
Bob Rilling <email:  rilling@ucar.edu>.  I handle only the aircraft data.
