Ron,

    Hi.  Thank you for sending the selected technical bulletins on the
Electra.  I received them in a timely manner.
I need help in another area nowspecifically the acquisition of 
10 Hz insitu data from an Electra flight off Shannon Ireland January 1997.
What avenues do I pursue to procure this data?  I am also waiting for a
reply from the PI of that experiment, Dr Verlinde, a professor in the
department.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Brad

Krista,

I got the following request and was wondering if RAF has any plans to
produce an HRT data set for FASTEX.  If not, can we do a "special" for Brad?
Normally, requests for special processing come from the PI and need to be
approved by the Projects & Data Support Group two weeks before the project's
field phase.  I'm not sure what policy we have after the fact.  I will cc
Dick on this so he knows that something is pending.

Brad,

You came to the right place.  I have forwarded your request to our FASTEX
project managers.  RAF has yet to produce the high-rate (HRT) data set, so
I'll have to update you with more information as I get it.  Hopefully that
will be occur before the weekend.  (The project was approved as HRT, so plans
should be in place to produce 10Hz data.)

Ron,

A few things RE this request:

First, no, there are no plans to generate a general high-rate
data set for the FASTEX Electra data.  The PIs for the aircraft
(Wakimoto, Testud, and Hildebrand) did not request it, nor have
the French indicated that they want it for the archive.

Second, Verlinde was NOT--to my knowledge--a PI for the Electra
deployment for FASTEX.  Verlinde came over briefly as an observer,
but he was not a PI on that deployment.  He is, I believe, a PI
on the Electra for Lake Ice, however.

The policy I stated to the French archive folks and to the Electra
PIs was that high-rate data would only be generated upon request
and only for specific flights and time segments....not just for
all flights and at all times.  I'm not sure off the top of my
head right now what should be done on this.  My guess is that
you should go back to him and ask for specific flights and time
segments and a specific list of variables that he's interested in.
However, I think that before that is done, we should make sure
that these data are to be made available freely to the general
scientific community.  I'm pretty certain that the FASTEX PIs
didn't ask for the one year of proprietary access
before we went into the field, but we should check on that to 
make sure before you hand out high-rate data.

Krista

P.S.  Can you please cc my response to Dick F.?  I forgot to
list him on the cc for this.  Thanks!

Krista,

I'll cc Dick on your reply.

Brad mentioned "an Electra flight" in his message.  I'll ask him for the
specific one and time period(s) of interest.

I'll also check with Brigitte to see if any FASTEX restricted access was
granted.

After I get this information, we can then make a plan.

Brad,

Regarding your data request:
In which specific flight are you interested?
What 10Hz variable measurements do you need?  (Please DON'T say "all.")
What time period(s) do you need?

Low-rate (LRT) data are available to help you decide, in case you have
not yet zeroed in on something specific.  Please let me know.

Ron,

   Hi.  I have included a list of insitu variables I am interested in.
Please send me the 10Hz data set of these variables.  If some are not
sampled at 10Hz then just ignore them.  Below is the time window I would
like to focus on:

	1/26/97   0310 GMT  to  0430 GMT    Shannon Ireland

Thanks for your help and I look forward to hearing from you.

Krista & Dick,

Following is Brad Cameron's "limited" HRT data request.  So far as ATD knows,
there are no restrictions on the FASTEX data set.  (There are no implied
restrictions from the FASTEX archive in France either.)  I don't know whether
Brad will be requesting more data, but this request doesn't look imposing.
In keeping with our policy, we should inform the PIs of this data request.

How shall we honor this request?  Who wants to handle the processing and QA,
and who will inform the PIs of this distribution?  I'm willing if given all
the information I need to proceed.

Ron,

Dick and I spoke about this briefly last week, and I think we
agreed that the best way to proceed from here is for you to please
process the high-rate data and let Dick and I know when it's ready.
He and I will then QC it before it's released to Brad.

Krista

Dick & Krista,

I have created a production NIMBUS HRT netCDF file for Brad Cameron's
requested time period (RF04 26 Jan 1997 03:10:00-04:30:00).  The only change
I made from the original LRT processing is that I chose to output a number
of raw and derived variables at different-from-default rates:
  1) all IRS ground speeds to 10 sps (They defaulted to 1 sps.)
  2) the thermoelectric DP measurements (raw and derived) to 1 sps,
      including things like EDPC, MR and RHUM
  3) PSW, PSWC to 1 sps
  4) the GPS-corrected lat, lon and ground speed components to 1sps

Since they were not requested, I turned off all the event markers
and the PMS-2D shadow-or signals.

So, if that meets with your approval, you may QA the file:
     /home/productiondata/o891rf04h.cdf

If everything looks OK to you, I'll make arrangements to ship the
file to Brad.

Brad,

When we are ready to deliver the data for FASTEX RF04 (26 Jan 1997
03:10:00-04:30:00), how do you want to receive it?  I can make the file
available via anonymous ftp or send you a magnetic tape (1/2" round, 8mm
ExaByte, 4mm DAT).  The tentative file size is about 40 Mbytes.

Since it is easier for us to standardize our data format, the file will
include some measurements at 1 sps.  The high-rate data are output at
either 10 sps or 25 sps.  The 10 sps data are the raw ground speed data
from the inertial platform.  The 25 sps data include all the raw and
derived high-rate measurements we normally can compute from the raw
data.  If a measurement doesn't have a high rate, either it has insufficient
response speed or its raw data were not sampled at a sufficiently high rate
for this project.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Ron,
   I would like to try the FTP avenue of data retrieval.  If for some
reason I have problems with the transfer , I'll request the tape.  Until
that time, let's go with FTP.  Thanks so much.

Krista & Dick,

   I have reviewed the production netCDF data file having the time period
requested by Brad Cameron (/home/productiondata/891rf04h.cdf), 1997-891
FASTEX HRT RF04 03:10-04:30 UTC.

   I am ready to make the data available to Brad via anonymous ftp on chinook.
Please let me know if all meets with your approval.  I plan to include this
QC report in my email message to him.

Following are my observations:
   The first round of processing was done using the production setup file
for the low-rate data.  For the most part that setup was adequate, but upon
reviewing the data, it was apparent that the top dew pointer (DPT, DPTC)
was not working properly for much of this time period.  I, therefore, set
the bottom dew pointer (DPB, DPBC) as the reference for all the derived
calculations.

ATRL:  03:10 - 03:20 -- bad
TTRL:  03:10 - 03:20 -- bad
 
DPTC:  04:07-04:30 -- response decidedly lags DPBC which was used as the
                       reference for the low-rate processing
 
DPXC:  used DPBC as the reference for this processing run
 
MRLA:  03:10 - 04:06 -- appears to have suffered from water ingestion and
RHOLA:                   was very erratic in operation  (It's possible that
                         what appears to be noise actually could be real
                         moisture transients.)
       04:21 - 04:30 -- inoperative
 
MRLA1:   Response seems much slower than RHOLA.  Was this instrument
RHOLA1:   mounted in a different way or used for a different purpose?
         04:04 - 04:05 -- large, unexplained negative transient
 
HGM:  04:05 - 04:30 -- goes nuts at full scale (>= 1000M)
 
PITCH:       03:32 - 03:34 -- don't agree! (aircraft began a roll here, too)
PITCH_PITR:        (Dick is already aware of this difference.)
 
PLWCC:  minor zero offset problem?
 
PLWC6_IBL:  03:58:55 -- bogus transient
 
SWB:  Seems to be a bit noisier than SWT.  Should either of them be this
SWT:   noisy?
 
UVB:  Signal seems a bit noisy.
UVT:  Signal seems a bit noisy.
 
Spectral analysis:
 1.  Most high-rate variables have a spectrum that flattens out somewhat
      with respect to -5/3 slope at about 7 Hz.
 2.  ATFH has a spectrum that flattens out somewhat with respect to -5/3
      slope at about 0.3 Hz.

Brad,

Sorry I did not get back to you earlier.  I received your email last
Friday after I left the office for an official NCAR function.

Your data set has been created, and I personally quality-checked it.
I have reported back to the RAF project managers for FASTEX, but they
have not yet given me approval to release the file.  I expect to hear
from them later today.

After their approval, I will put the data file on our anonymous ftp site,
and you can pick it up.  In the meantime, I have put a copy (ASCII) of
the netCDF header there in case you want an idea of what data you will
be getting.  Please be aware that the FlightDate value (01/25/1997) reflects
the date when the aircraft began collecting the data for the flight.  The
true date for the data you will receive is one day later (01/26/1997).
All times are UTC.

Brad,

   RAF has released the data file pertaining to your recent request for
high-rate data from FASTEX.  You may retrieve it via anonymous ftp:
          site:  raf.atd.ucar.edu
    login name:  anonymous
      password:  (use your full email address)
          path:  pub/fastex
          file:  891rf04h.cdf
          size:  39,564,732 bytes
        format:  netCDF

   I have reviewed the production netCDF data file (891rf04h.cdf, 1997-891
FASTEX HRT RF04 01/26/1997) UTC) having the time period you requested
(03:10-04:30).  Following are my observations:

   The first round of processing was done using the setup for the low-rate
production data (i.e., the software customization required when RAF processed
the low-rate data also was used for processing the high-rate data).  For
the most part that setup was adequate, but upon reviewing the data, it was
apparent that the top dew point sensor (DPT, DPTC) was not working properly
for much of the requested time period.  I, therefore, set the bottom dew
pointer (DPB, DPBC) as the reference for all the derived calculations and
reprocessed the data to produce the production high-rate data file.

The netCDF file's global attribute "FlightDate" is used as a reference date
to indicate when the aircraft began collecting data for this flight.  The
netCDF variables "base_time" and "time_offset" always will have the correct
date/time.

ATRL:  03:10 - 03:20 -- bad
TTRL:  03:10 - 03:20 -- bad
 
DPTC:  04:07-04:30 -- response decidedly lags DPBC which was used as the
                       reference for the low-rate processing
 
DPXC:  used DPBC as the reference for this processing run
 
MRLA:  03:10 - 04:06 -- appears to have suffered from water ingestion and
RHOLA:                   was very erratic in operation  (It's possible that
                         what appears to be noise actually could be real
                         moisture transients.)
       04:21 - 04:30 -- inoperative
 
MRLA1:   Response seems much slower than RHOLA.
RHOLA1:  04:04 - 04:05 -- large, unexplained negative transient
 
HGM:  04:05 - 04:30 -- goes nuts at full scale (>= 950M) (HGME OK)
 
PITCH:       03:32 - 03:34 -- don't agree! (aircraft began a roll here, too)
PITCH_PITR:   The difference doesn't seem to affect the wind data adversely.
 
PLWCC:  minor zero offset problem
 
PLWC6_IBL:  03:58:55 -- transient (bogus data)
 
SWB:  Seems to be a bit noisier than SWT.  Neither of these should be this
SWT:   noisy.
 
UVB:  Signal is a bit noisy.
UVT:  Signal is a bit noisy.
 
Spectral analysis:
 1.  Most high-rate variables have a spectrum that flattens out somewhat
      with respect to -5/3 slope at about 7 Hz.
 2.  ATFH has a spectrum that flattens out somewhat with respect to -5/3
      slope at about 0.3 Hz.

   Please refer to the original FASTEX Data Quality Report for general
comments and for additional information regarding this specific flight.
