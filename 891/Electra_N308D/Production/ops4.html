<P>
The following section is a version of the Project Specifications
document of the FASTEX Centra Data Archive Project. It has been
prepared by Martine Michou with contributions from Genevi&egrave;ve
Jaubert, Catherine Piriou and Oliver Traulle, all of them working
on data bases from recent field experiments at M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France.
The full document is available on the FASTEX servers or from the
FASTEX Project Office in Toulouse.
<H3><A NAME="intro">4.1 Introduction</A></H3>

<P>
This document describes the requirement for a FASTEX %(Fronts
and Atlantic Storm-Track Experiment) central data archive, and
the M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France/CNRM (Centre National de Recherches
M&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques) proposal to satisfy this requirement.
The M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France proposal relies on its expertise
in the development of field experiment databases (e.g., PYREX,
SEMAPHORE, and TOGA COARE), and on the fact that a number of FASTEX
relevant data sets is directly available from M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France
(see details in 4.6).
<H3><A NAME="requirement">4.2 Requirement for a FASTEX central
data archive</A></H3>

<P>
The FASTEX field experiment will collect, in the North Atlantic
region, over a 2-month period (January - February 1997), a unique
variety of atmospheric data, measured from both research platforms
(e.g., ships, aircraft) and operational ones (e.g., meteorological
stations, atellites) as described in previous sections of this
overview. The requirement for a FASTEX central data archive, recognized
since the early stage of the field experiment preparation, was
first formalized during the first FASTEX Scientific Steering Group
(SSG) meeting (March 95, see Summary and Conclusions by A. Joly,
pp. 6, 7). This requirement calls for:
<OL>
<LI>a facilitated access to selected data of interest to the international
FASTEX scientific community (France, UK, USA, Canada, Ireland,
etc\ldots). It is not intended to construct one central unique
archival of all FASTEX data. The idea is to identify a subset
of the data collected during the field experiment, for ingestion
into the central archive structure. Data access through this structure
should then be much simpler ;
<LI>the long-term archival of the FASTEX data identified under
1. In the short-term, the FASTEX central data archive will inevitably
duplicate other archiving efforts. This duplication should be
reduced to a large extent in the long-term, when the FASTEX central
data archive becomes the primary, and possibly the only source
of FASTEX data ;
<LI>a first approach to all FASTEX data by putting together a
centralized access to information about FASTEX data. This information
would be reduced to a vital minimum (what is available/where).
</OL>

<P>
All institutions already involved in the preparation of the field
experiment are potential users of this central archive. These
are as follows:
<P>
Canada: Atmospheric Environment Service;
<P>
France: INSU, Laboratoire d'A&eacute;rologie, M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France,
CETP, IFREMER;
<P>
Ireland: Irish Meteorological Service;
<P>
Iceland: Icelandic Meteorological Service;
<P>
Norway: Norwegian Meteorological Service;
<P>
UK: University of Reading, UK Meteorological Office;
<P>
Ukraine: Ukrainian Scientific Centre of the Ecology of Sea;
<P>
USA: NCAR, NASA (still under discussions), NOAA; University of
Washington, State University of New-York, UCLA, MIT;
<P>
World Meteorological Organization (COSNA group and WCRP).
<P>
Other groups may join the FASTEX research community, and hence
access the FASTEX central data archive, at a later stage, during
or after the field experiment (see details on the data access
in 4.3.2).
<P>
SSG meeting participants agreed on the proposal made by Meteo-France
to develop and host such a central archive at M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France/CNRM.
Paragraphs below detail the CNRM plan, based on what was presented
at the SSG and further discussions and work among a group of data
managers and scientists at CNRM. It goes without saying that Meteo-France
has some major interest in this project that would:
<P>
maximize the resources involved in the preparation of the field
experiment;
<P>
prepare the FASTEX post-field experiment research work;
<P>
and enhance the Meteo-France interaction with other scientists,
both nationally and internationally.
<H3><A NAME="central">4.3 FASTEX central data archive access policy</A>
</H3>

<H4><A NAME="input"></A>4.3.1 Data input to the central archive
</H4>

<P>
The FASTEX SSG, or an appropriate designated body, should agree
on the list of data sets that will be ingested into the central
archive.
<P>
The success of data ingestion into the central archive will be
based on the two following principles:
<P>
1 there will be low entry requirements on the data providers.
Input format or media will not be imposed, although a number of
recommendations will be made in order to minimize the entry work;
for instance, recommendations on the formulation of variables
such as date and position, and recommendations on the input data
format (GRIB, BUFR or other). Data transmission to the central
archive will be achieved either on line (through Internet), or
on an external media such as a CD-ROM, an Exabyte tape or other.
Discussions with scientists will lead to recommendations on the
characteristics of the central archive data sets (parameters that
should be included in a data set, temporal and spatial resolution,
etc\ldots). All efforts will be made to come to an agreement with
the data providers on the basis of these recommendations (see
first details in the document FASTEX Central Data Archive Project
- Central Archive Content'').
<P>
Emphasis will be put on the availability of relevant data documentation
in the central archive, noting that data are useless otherwise.
It is known that this could represent a non-negligible burden
on the data providers. All efforts will be made to minimize this
burden: a preparational work will be done by the central archive
managers with the available literature, on at least conventional
data'', and the documentation request will be fragmented into
pre and post field requests.
<P>
2 there should be a high responsiveness within the scientific
community for providing both documentation and data, once committed
to it. Individual responsibility, and possibly peer review pressure,
should ensure the delivery of data to the central archive, as
planned.
<H4><A NAME="output">4.3.2 Data output from the central archive</A>
</H4>

<P>
A general data access policy is described in the Summary and Conclusions
of the 1st FASTEX SSG meeting'' by A. Joly, p 7. In brief, access
to FASTEX data, in particular from the central archive, should
not be restricted. In practice, restricted access to specific
data, over a definite period of time that should not, in any case,
be longer that 2 years, could be managed in the central archive.
With regard to the preparation of the central archive, it will
be recommended that professional credit be given to scientists
who prepare data sets for public distribution, whenever making
use of the data.
<P>
Data will be available either through an on-line access or on
an external media (see Data Distribution in 4.4.3).
<H3><A NAME="proposed">4.4 Proposed FASTEX central data archive
functions</A></H3>

<H4><A NAME="archival"></A>4.4.1 Data archival</H4>

<P>
The data sets listed below have been identified for a long-term
archival in the FASTEX central archive (see details on the data
sets in the document: FASTEX Central Data Archive Project, Central
Archive Contents'', and details on the corresponding observational
platforms in subsection 4.5}). In its preliminary version, this
list of data must be considered to be tentative. In its final
version, requests for archiving additional data sets will be examined
on a case by case basis by the SSG.
<P>
The domain and period of interest of these data are the following,
unless specified otherwise:
<P>
FASTEX domain: 20N-90N ; 100W-40E,
<P>
FASTEX field experiment period: January - February 1997.
<P>
<B>1 atmospheric in-situ data : </B>
<P>
Radiosonde: from all WMO upper-air stations in the FASTEX domain,
and from specific FASTEX ship and land sites; both GTS and high-resolution
data.
<P>
Dropsonde: from all equipped FASTEX research aircraft; both GTS
and high-resolution data (all dropsonde data should circulate
over the GTS).
<P>
Research aircraft: a selection of processed in-situ parameters
at a given temporal resolution from all FASTEX research aircraft.
<P>
Commercial aircraft: GTS and high-resolution in-situparameters
from agreed-upon aircraft.
<P>
<B>2 atmospheric remote data</B> 
<P>
UHF profilers: 1/2 hourly profiles from land and ship FASTEX sites.
<P>
Remote sensing device research aircraft data (interferometers,
lidars, radiometers, scatterometers, and other): agreed-upon scans.
<P>
Conventional land surface radar data: agreed-upon scans from the
UK, Irish, and Western France networks.
<P>
<B>3 analysed fields</B> 
<P>
Operational analyses, replaced later by re-analyses when available;
global fields from the Meteo-France ARPEGE model, and the UKMO
Unified Model at least.
<P>
<B>4 aircraft radar data</B> 
<P>
Doppler radar data: agreed-upon high-resolution and all largest
domain coarse resolution wind and reflectivity 3D fields, all
1 D profiles
<P>
Other radars: agreed-upon reflectivity fields.
<P>
<B>5 satellite data</B> 
<P>
A wide sample of satellite data for both geostationary (GOES and
Meteosat) and polar-orbiting satellites (NOAA and DMSP ones).
<P>
The requirements are for images (IR, Vis, and water vapor channels),
for radiances (raw and clear-air), and for inverted profiles and
other elaborated parameters (in this third category, the main
needs being for temperature profiles, water vapor profiles, total
liquid water content, cloud liquid water, precipitation, surface
wind, upper-level wind, sea surface temperature, and ozone).
<P>
The objectives are to study the assimilation of satellite data,
and inversion techniques
<P>
Other data under consideration for ingestion in the central archive:
soundings from new GOES, and GPS refractivity.
<P>
<B>6 surface in-situ data</B> 
<P>
GTS surface data from all land, ship, and buoy sites within the
FASTEX domain.
<H4><A NAME="management">4.4.2 Data management</A></H4>

<P>
The following data management tasks will be performed :
<OL>
<LI>reformat of data into the central archive data format;
<LI>data checks. Minimal checks will be performed locally at CNRM
(e.g., gross-limit checks). It is anticipated that the data validation
will be performed before the transfer of data to CNRM;
<LI>''assembly'' of data from similar-type platforms (e.g., radiosonde
and dropsonde ones).
</OL>

<P>
<B><A NAME="metadata">4.4.3 Data and metadata distribution </A></B>
<P>
The interface to the central archive will offer the following
functions:
<OL>
<LI>catalog of all FASTEX data archived in the central archive;
the catalogue will include all available documentation on the
data;
<LI>on-line data access, to the extent possible depending on the
data volume, through a client/server configuration. A Mosaic-like
interface will be developed; reading routines will be provided
for all formats used, i.e., GRIB BUFR or other;
<LI>selection of data, during the on-line access, using a variety
of criteria (e.g., data type, period);
<LI>on-line access to information about FASTEX data not included
in the central archive (what is available/where);
<LI>off-line data access. All data of the central archive will
be transferred to an external media for large distribution. The
preferred current technology is the CD-ROM one, which is widely
spread, long-term reliable, and of easy production. For some data
sets, there will be a 1-time transfer to such an external media.
For others, it is anticipated that three versions will be produced
(1st and 2nd versions 1 and 2 years after the field experiment,
final version 4 years after the field experiment);
<LI>documentation on the central archive contents will be available
also as a hard-copy document. Three versions should be produced,
along the same schedule as the data CD-ROM one (see 5 above);
</OL>
