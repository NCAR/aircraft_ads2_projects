>Hi Dick,
>
>This is a quick report on how things are going on AMTS.  The trip from
>Jeffco to Resolute Bay was uneventful.  No problems with customs or
>immegration in Winnipeg.  The flight was about 2.5 hours.  The flight
>to Resolute bay was about 6.5 hours, about an hour longer than planned
>because of headwinds.  We arrived between 8 and 9 in the morning.
>The total flight hours so far is about 9.  I don't have the flight
>reports in front of me so I can't give you the exact hours.
>
>The locatin we picked put for parking the aircraft during the site survey
>looked too soft and a little crowded so we are parked in fromt of the old
>main terminal building.  After a bit of rewiring we have ground power
>for Gardner's  lasers.  We also unloaded the aircraft and put everything 
>in a garage of the old terminal.  Not a bad morning's work on Thursday.
>The weather when we arrived on Wed was clear and calm with a temperature
>of about 40.  Since then (all day Thursday and today) the wind has been 
>blowing 30 to 50 kmph with temperatures closer to freezing.  We have
>had a few snow showers today.
>
>Yesterday afternoon we located a Herman/Nelson heater to warm the
>aircraft with.  The lasers were not able to provide enough heat to keep
>the aircraft cabin warm (not a big surprize).  That worked OK but we need
>to close a few holes (door cracks) to make the heater more efficient
>and then we will need only an hour or two to warm up the aircraft before
>the lasers are turned on.
>
>The first flight is planned for tonight with an 8pm departure.  Even
>though it is not dark flying at local midnight gives the lidar a lower
>background so that is when we will be flying.  The flight will be from
>Resolute Bay to Sondrestrom Greenland (just a fly-over, no landing) and
>back.  Henry thinks it will be about a 7 to 7.5 hour flight.
>
>The first flight to the North pole will be Sunday night.  George hopes
>that the signal strength in the weak return channel will be strong
>enough to measure temperatures.  If it isn't then they will still be able 
>to measure iron densities.
>
>All for now.

Via today's noon mail pickup at Jeffco I will be sending you the following
eleven (11) 8mm (Exabyte) tapes for archiving to the SCD Mass Store System:
 
     R1350, R1352, R1354 through R1362
 
Please be aware that these tapes are for "read only."  Unlike ordinary
audio, video and DAT tapes, a black "hole" actually makes these tapes
writeable.  Therefore, the red, write-enable flag will be in the exposed
(ERASE OFF) position.  Do NOT change the position of this flag.  If a
tape seems to be write enabled, contact me immediately.
 
Please let me know when they are ready to read.
Thanks.  :)

Bruce,

I got a phone call this morning from U Illinois (Xinzhao Chu) who has an
*immediate* need for the data from Leonids98 and AMTS.  As you know, the
scrubber was removing files from the ftp area without sending any email
warning messages.  (I fixed that problem yesterday!)

I was able to restore the Leonids98 netCDF files, and, based on an email
you sent to Xinzhao, which she forwarded to me, I copied the AMTS production
netCDF files to the ftp site, too.  I also gave them the URL for Unidata's
netCDF.

Apparently from Leonids98 you made some ASCII files available to Gardner
and company.  Is there a way to restore them?  Are you planning to create
ASCII files from AMTS, too?

They seemed to "need the data immediately" and were retrieving the files as I
was restoring them to the ftp site and talking on the phone.

I hope that you wanted the AMTS data released, since that's effectively what
I have done.

Hi, Ron:

I really appreciate you for your great help to get all the Leonids and AMTS
Flight Data of Electra for us this morning. These data will enable us to
process our data formally. Thanks a lot!

As you know, the flight data are in netCDF format. We need some time to
find out how to decode the data. If you could get the code from Bruce to
transfer the data from netCDF format to ASCII format, that would be a great
favor. I know you will ask Bruce about it, please keep us informed. Thank
you very much!!!

Best regards!

Xinzhao
