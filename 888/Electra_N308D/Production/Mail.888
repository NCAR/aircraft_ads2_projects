Hi Ron,  Not sure I'm sending this to the correct address BUT RAP import job
using R747 failed last night (12/14).  The drives just lost their wits and had
to be restarted.  Your job was lost - tape is AOK.  Please resubmit.  THANKS,
Suzy X1200

Paul & Bruce,

In the interim, while we are feeling our way through production processing
using NIMBUS, I thought I'd give you a brief set of steps which you can
use as a guideline for your processing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

         Quick Overview of NIMBUS Production Processing Procedures
         ---------------------------------------------------------
                           Ronald L. Ruth
                            January 1994

  Note:  Production processing is a separate entity with an unique
          procedure.  Do not confuse it with ordinary uses of NIMBUS.

 1)  Archive the Master raw ADS data tapes to the SCD Mass Store System (MSS).
      Make sure this is done first.  (See RAF Data Manager for assistance.)
 2)  Peruse the entire project's data using quick-look tools.  Identify all
      changes that are needed for production (final) processing.
   a)  Use whatever tools you want, including WINDS, NIMBUS, PV-Wave,
        MATLAB, Xanadu, DAP, etc.
   b)  Note instrument anomalies, failures, etc.
   c)  List equipment changes made during the project.
   d)  Make a list of changes needed for production.  Examples include:
        calibration changes, reference variable substitutions.
   e)  If possible, create groups of flights which all need the same setup and
        whose processing will be identical.  (A group consists of two or more
        flights.)
   f)  If you use NIMBUS during this time, you may want to save "setups" in
        your own processing directory.  (List the setup files you may want to
        recall for production processing.)
 3)  Completely summarize all the information needed for production processing,
      put it in a Project Production Setup document and send a copy to the RAF
      Data Manager.  (Include project's instrumentation list and ADS setup
      table.)
 4)  Set up NIMBUS for LRT (low-rate turbulence) production processing (no
      matter what the final output type will be).
   a)  Login as user `nimbus.'  See Chris Webster or the RAF Data Manager if
        you need the password.
   b)  Use the project summary (from 3) to set up the NIMBUS processor with
        help from Chris's "cheat sheet."
   c)  You may have to add and/or change extended definitions in the
        variable dictionary (using vared).
 5)  Make one production run using a representative flight.
   a)  Make sure all the required variables are output to the netCDF file
        (use `ncdump -h <file>').
   a)  Review output data using WINDS or other available tools.
   b)  Note changes that are needed, and rerun, if necessary.
   c)  Repeat using one example from each group.
 6)  When all is ready for production, check available disk space to make
      sure that room exists for the processed data.  (You may have to do
      production runs in pieces, and archive them before continuing.  Also,
      other project processing may compete for the available disk space and
      may require negotiation with other users.)
 7)  Use NIMBUS to process each flight.
 8)  Thoroughly peruse the output from each production run, looking for errors 
      and things overlooked in setup.
 9)  When all flights have been processed to your satisfaction, have the
      RAF Data Manager archive the output files to the MSS.
10)  If HRT (high-rate turbulence) processing is required, repeat steps 6), 7)
      and 9) after selecting the `high-rate' button in the NIMBUS processor
      window.
11)  Check a representative sample of HRT processing using appropriate tools.
      (This may include spectrum analysis.)
12)  Repeat 9) for the HRT data.
13)  Prepare final documentation binder for shipment to Principal
      Investigator(s).
14)  Determine type of output product(s) needed by PI(s) and schedule RDP
      to copy and ship the output data.  (See RAF Data Manager for
      instructions.)

Bruce,
 
Sorry I got the project number wrong in the "Subject" of my first mailing.

I checked the 888 header for consistency with other data you included in your
processing memo.  the only discrepancy I found was with DPB:
            Post-cal  Nimbus
   Coef #0   0.3448   0.3488
Since this is the "constant" term, the error is negligible, but I suppose it
would be good if they agreed.
 
I compared the 886 header with what you've set up.  886 had DEI, DNI and
DVALUE, all of which are not necessary.  It also had ATTACK and SSLIP which
I would include only to complete the dependency tree.

So, in summary, I'd recommend the following before going into production:
  1)  Change DPB Coef #0 to 0.3448
  2)  Add ATTACK and SSLIP to the output list.

Bruce,

I have finished archiving to the SCD Mass Store System (MSS) the data and
support files for 4-888 ALOHA-94.

Have you any need for the netCDF files on /home/local/staticdata?

Also, should I have that data copied to tape and sent to the P.I.?  If so,
please give me all pertinent details:
  1.  name, email address and phone# of P.I. (Chet Gardner?);
  2.  name, email address and phone# of person to recieve shipment
   (if different from P.I.);
  3.  UPS/USPS shipping address;
  4.  tape type (1/2" 9-track, ExaByte);
  5.  media density (800, 1600, 6250 or low, high).

Are there any other recpipients?

Thanks.  I'll archive that file to the MSS and pass the data along to
Yiyun Gu at UI.
