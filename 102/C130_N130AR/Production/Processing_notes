Research Flights
----------------
Original processing of the research flights produced netCDF files that needed
modification.  A series of skeleton programs produced netCDF files to be
merged into this original one:
   1)  CVI measurements from Dr. Cynthia Twohy, including:
        CVINFLAG, CVRAD, CVCWC, CVN, CVFACT, CVFX0C, CVFX1C, CVFX2C, CVFCN2C
         and CVEMSW
        File name format:  cvrfXX.cdf, where XX is flight number
       The routines used to make these netCDF files can be found in the
        subdirectory "CVI."
   2)  Ozone corrections from Teresa Campos, including:
        TEO3C
        File name format:  o3rfXX.cdf, where XX is flight number
       The "amlib" files (for the NIMBUS skeleton program) that were used
        to make these netCDF files can be found in the subdirectory "O3."
   3)  Corrections to PVM-100 and PMS Liquid Water Content probes and other
        miscellaneous changes, including:
        ATX, HGM232, OAT, PLWCC, PLWCC1, PLWCF_RPC/PLWCF_LPI, RSTB1, XGLWC
         and XTSURF (ATX, HGM232, PLWCF_RPC/PLWCF_LPI and RSTB1 were passed
         through unaltered.)
        The skeleton program for this procedure can be found in the "coupling"
         subdirectory.  Its main purpose is to remove long-term drifts
         for certain measurements by subtracting from them a long-term
         difference (with a 250-second time constant) from a reference
         measurement.  Affected measurements include:  OAT, PLWCC, PLWCC1,
         XGLWC.  A second purpose is to create an estimated radiomentric
         surface temperature (from RSTB1) which accounts for the moisture
         attenuation in the atmosphere between the aircraft and the surface.
        File name format:  couprfXX.cdf where XX is flight number
   4)  FSSP-100 data were reprocessed to incorporate the changes recommended
        by Darrel Baumgardner.  A Depth-of-field value of 2.81 mm and a Beam
        Diameter of 0.19 mm have been used for both probes for all flights.
        A new set of bin sizes also has been used.  Due to the lack of
        houskeeping variables, the original NIMBUS processor was modified
        by Chris Webster to implement an empirical correction and then used
        to produce limited-variable netCDF files.  It can be found in the
        tar file "nimbus_indo.tar."
        
The four sub-files then were merged into their corresponding original
nimbus-processed netCDF files using "ncmerge" to produce the final
production netCDF files.  Note:  As of this writing, the netCDF merge program,
ncmerge, only moves the data values, not the netCDF attributes.  As a result,
new and/or revised attributes for the merged variables were not put into
the production netCDF file.  This can be confusing for such things as PMS-1D
cell sizes, depth-of-field, calibration coefficients, etc.  (Perhaps these
attributes can be updated at a later time.)

When the special netCDF data files from CVI, O3, COUPLED and FSSP were merged
into their appropriate production netCDF files, the attributes for the new
and replaced variables were not transferred into the netCDF header.  If those
attributes are needed, one will have to retrieve the special netCDF files
and extract the attributes from them.  This may only make sense for the
reprocessed FSSP data.

Ferry Flights
-------------
Prior to processing the Ferry Flights for this project, many extant files had
to be renamed temporarily, since the NIMBUS software does not yet recognize
the difference between flight types (Research, Ferry, Test, etc.).  The
specific file types which had to be renamed to preserve the data and logs
for the Research Flights are:
  NIMBUS production output netCDF files:  /home/productiondata/102rfxx.cdf
  NIMBUS production log files:  /home/local/proj/102/Production/logFile_LRT.XX
  NIMBUS production group file:  /home/local/proj/102/Production/FlightGroups
  NIMBUS production setup files:  /home/local/proj/102/Production/Flight_XX
Also, a newer version of the NIMBUS software was used to process these data.
The support files unique to the Ferry Flight processing will be archived to
the SCD Mass Store System (MSS) with special names.

NIMBUS has been bailing out of the processing for Ferry Flights:  FF01,
FF06B, FF07, FF08, FF09 and FF10 with the following error:
     ncattput: ncid 7: Operation not allowed in data mode
     [1]    Exit 3               nimbus

In each case, the file being read is the original tape image brought
down from the Mass Store (COS-block stripped).  It may be prudent to
see whether the COS-blocked file would work better.  (It didn't.)

NIMBUS still has not been fixed to handle the error reported on 17 December,
but Chris is working on it.  In the meantime, I archived the following ferry
flights whose processing did complete successfully:  FF03, FF04, FF05A, FF05B
and FF06A.

Archiving the raw data for FF10 and FF11 is awaiting an SCD software fix
to handle skipping a large number of records.  When the tapes were archived
originally, the new "mss4" machine was used, and it produced segments too
large to retrieve to Jeffco via MIGS.  When I tried rearchiving them with
fewer records per segment, the number of records to skip overflowed an
internal counter in SCD's import software.

Chris "fixed the special version of the NIMBUS processor (in the directory
/home/local/nimbus_indo).  I was able to process all but one of the
problematic ferry flights successfully.  FF08 still failed; it has some
serious problems.  I will try to use the COS-blocked version of the ADS
file to see whether that helps.

When I originally processed the Ferry flights, I used the standard release
of NIMBUS.  It did not have the special FSSP corrections found in the version
in the nimbus_indo directory.  Therefore, I reprocessed all the Ferry flights
today to get the best FSSP concentrations.  These files need to be rearchived
to the MSS.

Today I tried processing FF08 using the COS-blocked versions of the files
brought down from the MSS.  The INDOEX version of NIMBUS ran to successful
conclusion, so it looks like that is a good alternative for some of the
problematic files that have garbaged time stamps.

I discovered that the setup file used for FF07-FF11 (Flight_16) was not
properly written.  Therefore, I need to reprocess these flights after fixing
this problem.  FF11 is still awaiting a successful archive to the MSS from
tape.

Yesterday, I reprocessed FF07 through FF10 using the processor in the
"nimbus_indo" directory and a revised Flight_16 setup file (restricts
the variable list to those requested.)  Today I archived these new files
to the MSS.  (I'm still waiting for FF11 raw tape archive completion.)

Today I processed FF11 and archived it to the MSS after the raw data
finished archiving.

The file names in this directory that are unique to processing the Ferry
Flights (and reprocessing the FSSP) have special naming conventions.  They
were renamed following the processing to not conflict with the research
flight names.  ("x" represents the flight number in all the examples below.)
  - setup files (FSSP reprocess) from Flight_x           to setup.102FSSP_x
  - setup files (Ferry)          from Flight_x           to FFlight_x
                                 from Flight_Groups file to FFlight_Groups
  - nimbus log files (Ferry)     from logFile_LRT.x      to logFile_LRT.FFx
  - nimbus log files (FSSP)      from logFile_LRT.x      to logFile_FSSP.x
