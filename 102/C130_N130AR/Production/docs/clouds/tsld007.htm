The correlations between LWC measurements made on the same wing are excellent, i.e. 
</UL><UL>
       PLWCC Vs PVM
</UL><UL>
       PLWCC Vs Left Wing FSSP (Flights 1-3)
</UL><UL>
       PLWCC1 Vs Right Wing FSSP (Flights 4-18)
</UL><UL>
with R2 &#062 0.80 during most flights.
</UL><UL>

</UL><UL>
Trend in the slopes between the FSSP and other
</UL><UL>
sensors indicates possible change in FSSP
</UL><UL>
optics, but changes in cloud types can not be
</UL><UL>
ruled out, i.e. in polluted clouds with small droplets the FSSP is in better agreement with the other probes,  while in the less polluted clouds with larger droplets, there is less agreement.
</UL><UL>

</UL><UL>
A comparison of correlations between sensors on the same and opposite wings provides a measure of the scale of cloud structure, i.e. separating sensors by approximately 30 m decreases correlatiions from &#062 0.90 (PLWCC vs PVM) to &#060  0.70 ( PLWC1 vs PVM).
