To all,

This memo has been sent to alert users of the final production flight-level
netCDF data for the NCAR/RAF EC-130Q Hercules aircraft of an error in one
of the measurements.

In December 2001,  Cynthia Twohy (Oregon State U) discovered differences
between CONCF_LPI, FSSP-100 Concentration (all cells), and CFSSP_LPI,
FSSP-100 Concentration (per cell).  By totaling all the bin values in
CFSSP_LPI, one should get the same total as CONCF_LPI.  Such is not the
case with this data set; instead CONCF_LPI is generally less--up to about
8% at the highest concentrations.

Upon analyzing this descrepancy, RAF found that a correction equation from
Darrel Baumgardner was applied to the CFSSP_LPI calculation but omitted from
the CONCF_LPI calculation.  To obtain a correct value for CONCF_LPI, one needs
to sum up all the values in CFSSP_LPI and use that total instead.

Because the data are recoverable within the data files, RAF is not planning
to reissue a "corrected" data set at this time.
