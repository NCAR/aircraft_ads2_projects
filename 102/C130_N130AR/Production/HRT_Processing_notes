From Dick Friesen's email to Andy Heymsfield on 11 October 1999:
  I understand your need for the high rate data and you are pursuing the 
right course talking to Ron Ruth. Of the six flights you mention I would 
suggest that we run one first (2/20?) and you take a look to see that you
are getting what you expect. (These will be very large files.) There are 
several things about the processing of the low-rate files that I should 
point out. The gerber probe, the liquid water probes (King probes), the 
ozone, the CVI measurements, and the ophir were all handled with special 
processing and merged back in to the main nimbus CDF file. Also, we worked 
with Darrel to put in some special processing for the FSSP-100 to account for
the lack of houskeeping data (I think you are aware of this). This code will
have to be modified to the high rate and checked out. The point of all of this
is that it is not a trivial task to produce a high rate data set with all of
the special processing incorporated for INDOEX. 
  I propose that we run a first flight without all of the special processing
except for the FSSP-100. Ron can work with Darrel and Chris to make sure
that the FSSP code is working at the high rate. The CVI and ozone data are
only available at the low rate. The ophir, gerber and King probes will not
have the offset removed without special processing. (I believe the ophir and
the King probes were sampled at the higher rate, but I am not sure what the
upper limit of repsonse of the King probes is.) The gerber probe was 
sampled at 250 sps, and Ron can process it at this rate if you wish - it will
have an offset, but should give a good reading of the fluctuations and 
structures.

RLR  18 February 2K
-------

   The prototype HRT setup file contains flight-specific information.
I need to edit the file then test it to assure that NIMBUS can handle
the changes without choking.

RLR   4 April 2K
-------

   I made the HRT setup file generic by only keeping the necessary parameters.
I also changed some entries in the LowRateVars file to provide the correct
output rate for some measurements.

RF03 Spectrum analysis:
   Spectral analysis was done primarily during the time period 5:00 to
5:30 UTC (with the "offending" measurements checked from 10:00 to 10:30).
Most measurements were well behaved.  Those singled out below were worth
reporting.  Some had unusual or unexpected responses; ones that disturbed
me most are starred.
  -ATWH/ATRR coherence drops off @ about 0.5Hz where phase = 90 deg.
  -DPTC/DPBC coherence drops off @ about 0.3Hz.
  -DPB/DPBC spectrum begins flattening out about 1Hz.
 *-DPT/DPTC spectrum begins flattening out about 2Hz but takes an upward turn
    above 4.5Hz as if some other signal was aliased in.  Since this measurement
    is used for all reference humidity measurements, this behavior can be
    found in EDPC, MR, RHUM, RHODT, SPHUM, THETAE and THETAV (minor effect).
    The spectra for MRLA and MRLA1 do not show this effect.  (This occurred
    throughout the flight.
 *-FCNC spectrum takes an upward turn above 0.75Hz and has strong peaks
    @ 0.125Hz and 0.25Hz (0.1Hz and 0.3Hz @ 10:00 UTC). 
  -PSFC and PSFDC coherence drops off and phase drifts @ about 2Hz.
  -QCFC and QCRC coherence drops off @ about 5Hz; phase OK.
  -TKAR spectrum has a strong peak @ 3Hz.
 *-UI, VY, WS spectra have little sharp spikes at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6Hz (5Hz
    only @ 10:00).
 *-XUIC, XVYC, XWSC spectra have little sharp spikes at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6Hz
    (5Hz only @ 10:00).
 *-VEW spectrum has sharp spikes at 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5Hz (OK @ 10:00).
 *-VNS spectrum has sharp spikes at 2, 3, 4 & 5Hz (OK @ 10:00).
 *-VSPD spectrum has sharp spikes at 6.5, 7 & 8Hz (OK @ 10:00).
 *-VSPD and WP3 coherence drops off @ about 5Hz, and phase begins drifting
    @ about 0.5Hz (45 deg @ 4Hz, 90 deg @ 8Hz).
  -ACINS and WP3 phase remains @ about 90 deg throughtout the spectral range.
 *-XPSFD bottoms out about 0.1Hz then rises to a peak @ about 0.3Hz then
    drops back down again (OK @ 10:00).

Processing of Andy Heymsfield's priority flights (RF03, RF04, RF09, RF11, RF14
and RF17) during the past few days has been very slow, taking almost two hours
per flight.  The NFS transfer rates have been extremely slow.

I discovered today that some derived measurements have been mistakenly output
at the high rate.  These include:  COCAL, COCOR, CONC2C_OBR, CONC2P_IBR.
For some reason, the PMS-2D suffixes must be added to the names in the
LowRateVars file or they are ignored.

I must rerun all the flights to produce the correct rates for the above
measurements.

RF04 (04:00-05:00):  PLWC6_OBL looks to be about 2 orders of magnitude too
                      large.
                     TKAT has zero values interspersed with the good data.
                      (Looks like a despiker may work.)

RLR  26 April 2K
-------

Rerunning flights, because COCAL, COCOR, CONC2C_OBR and CONC2P_IBR had
incorrect output rates.

As of 11:30 a.m., RF03 and RF04 have been done.  RF09 is in progress.
As of  2:30 p.m., RF03, RF04 and RF09 have been done.  RF11 is in progress.

2:40 p.m.  I discovered that I'm using the standard version of NIMBUS,
not the special INDOEX version (nimbus_indo).  So, I'm starting over.
Andy's priority order is:  RF03, RF04, RF11, RF17, RF14 and RF09.

Andy Heymsfield notified at 5:11 p.m. in a memo which describes the
"preliminary" nature of the data set:  only run through "nimbus" without
adding any merged data.  Therefore the following are not present:
  1.  add corrected CVI measurements;
  2.  further correct the TECO Ozone data;
  3.  remove long-term drift from some measurements;
  4.  calculate an estimated surface temperature from a Heimann IR radiometer.

RLR  1 May 2K
-------

Processed RF01, RF02 and RF05 as HRT using "nimbus_indo" version.

RLR  11 May 2K
-------

Processed RF06, RF07, RF08 and RF10 as HRT using "nimbus_indo" version.

RLR  12 May 2K
-------

Processed RF12, RF13, RF15 and RF16 as HRT using "nimbus_indo" version.
It turns out that RF16 has its flight number as RF160 in the ADS header.
This produced an RF160 flight which didn't properly load the setup file.
I fixed the header for ADS segment RF16A and will rerun it tomorrow.

RLR  15 May 2K
-------

Processed RF18 and reprocessed RF16.  All HRT data now archived to the MSS.

Based on a query by Greg McFarquar, I checked the FSSP-100 bin sizes in
use for each LRT flight.  The standard 0-47 um set was used for: RF01 - RF03.
The 0-70 um set was used for:  RF04 - RF18.

AFSSP_LPI:SerialNumber = "FSSP109" ;
AFSSP_RPC:SerialNumber = "FSSP122" ;

Sent email to Andy Heymsfield informing him that all data have been processed.
He was grateful.
