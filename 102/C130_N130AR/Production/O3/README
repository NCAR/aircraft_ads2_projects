This directory contains special files used to correct the Ozone data for
the 1999-102 INDOEX project.  These files have the source code for the
"amlib" portion of the NIMBUS skeleton program.  The skeleton program was
used to generate netCDF files with the corrections.  The netCDF files were
merged into the NIMBUS-processed netCDF files to create the final production
data sets for this project.

If the skeleton program needs to be used again, the rest of the source files
for it can be found in the directory "coupling" in the directory parent to
this one.
