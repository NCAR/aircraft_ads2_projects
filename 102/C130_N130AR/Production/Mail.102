     Put up some propaganda from the Seychelles & Maldives
  in the break room. The Reef hotel would probably be the one
  used for the project, if it is flown from the Seychelles. 
  Also put the inflight magazine from Air Seychelles (airline
  noted worldwide for making bags disappear) on the table. Please
  don't toss it.


  Thanks,

  Jim

   At a recent INDOEX meeting we were reminded that hepatitis A and B shots
are recommended for travel in the Maldives (off the sourthern tip of India)
and India. The project will be conducted out of the Maldives. The reason for 
the early reminder is that the shots require a booster shot about six months
after the first shot. I believe that these shots are provided free to NCAR
staff that travel, and vouchers can be obtained from Steve Sadler. So please 
plan ahead so that you will be fully immunized by the time travel begins in
February, 1999.
   More information about travel to, and life in the Maldives will be forth-
coming after JOSS and ATD staff travel there this February for site surveys
and the pre-INDOEX experiments.

I am glad to be back at Jeffco after being in Male, Republic of Maldives for
2 1/2 weeks or so on an INDOEX-related experiment.  I was there while the
JOSS people were also doing a site survey for the 1999 INDOEX mission
involving the C130 and a number of ATD instruments.  A full report of that
site survey will soon be available from JOSS, but I thought I would try to
give everyone at Jeffco some flavor of the place in the meantime.

It sure seems to me that the place is workable.  It isn't Kansas or
California but it will work.  There are places to stay, ways to get around,
and the people are quite friendly although reserved.  There are no hardware
stores of the McGuckin quality, but they are adequate.  Compressed gases are
available with adequate ordering lead time.  The normal diet is heavily
dependent on fish.  The curry dishes were great.  There are adequate
restaurants, and bottled water is available.  I didn't drink the tap water,
but I did consume some drinks with ice which I suspect is made with tap
water.

There are a number of computer stores in Male, and the place is quite
computer literate--but only for PCs.  I didn't see any Sun workstations
or Macintosh computers.  It appears that all of the networking connections
can be available through the local telephone company.  It sounds as if the
network connection will be as good as Jeffco providing we have the right
"intranet" facilities.

The recreational facilities are limited in Male.  Most activities will
likley revolve around the water/ocean.  The snorkeling is great.  If you
have any interest in snorkeling or scuba, this is a very good place to be.
I didn't get to try fishing, but I was told it is also good.  One man
mentioned that bonefish were in the reef lagoons, but he had not actually
tried catching them.  For those with flyrod skills, this might be quite
enjoyable.

I will put some of the info I collected while in the Maldives in the library
for your perusal as well as some photographs I took.  The book "Maldive
Impressions" has some great pictures as well.  I would appreciate it if you
would leave this material in the library, but you are welcome to look through
it and make copies if you want.  Below is a list of some websites which have
info about the Maldives if you are interested in looking further.  If you
have any specific questions, let me know.

     http://www-indoex.ucsd.edu/
This is the Scripps INDOEX website.  There is Maldives-related info under
the "related sites" section.

The following sites are mostly about some of the resorts in the Maldives but
they give you a flavor of the location.

If you are not interested or involved in INDOEX there is probably no
need to read any further ................

On 21 May, staff from JOSS, ATD, UCAR Finance and Contracts met for a
third time  to share information regarding the 1999 INDOEX field
project.  Here is a short summary on the latest status:

Due to India's need to show off their nuclear capabilities,
collaboration between the US and India is presently on hold.  India's
contribution to INDOEX includes (but is not limited to) provision of one
of the research vessels, and provision of satellite imagery.  More
importantly, India controls a large part of the air traffic space that
INDOEX airplanes will operate in.  Although there is some concern that
the project may not happen, preparations proceed as planned.

The second international INDOEX planning meeting will take place this
month in Utrecht, the Netherlands (20 - 23 June).  The agenda is online
(accessible from the ATD Field Projects - INDOEX web page at
www.atd.ucar.edu/dir_off/projects/1999/INDOEX.html). Dick Friesen and
Bruce Gandrud will be there to answer ATD-related questions.

An Operations Simulation Meeting is planned for August 6 - 8, 1998
either here in Boulder or at Scripps.  Similar to FASTEX and TOGA COARE,
participants from the Netherlands, France, and the US will go through
flight planning exercises using data that were collected in the INDOEX
area earlier this year.

JOSS just published their site survey report on Male.  It's not online
yet but I have a couple of hard copies if anybody is interested. 
Various Bulletins regarding shipping, travel, housing, health etc. will
be distributed starting mid July.

Operations Center space is still an issue.  At this point it is assumed
that there won't be enough space available at the airport and that
additional office space has to be rented on Male.  We will know more by
July or August.

The next joint JOSS, ATD, UCAR INDOEX meeting will happen on 1 July 1998
at 1 pm in the FL4 Unidata conference room.

Hello folks:  Just a not so gentle and not so subtle reminder that you are
going to be shot this Wednesday between 9:30-11:00 am, in FL-1, room 2084
(same place as last time for most of you). Those of you who can't make it
and have already contacted me will be getting your voucher in the mail soon
(if not already). Those of you who have already completed all of your shots,
IGNORE THIS message, go away, don't bug me, no soup for you!!!!.  If you
don't know if you're done, email me and I'll tell you.

If you can't make it, not a big deal, let me know and I'll send you a
voucher. However, it is a big deal that I know before Wednesday so we can
order to appropriate number of shots!  Questions??? Ask'em and I'll answer
em, I hope.

Regards,
s2

Steve,

Well, I spaced it out, and I'm sorry.  My computer was hung this morning
and its programmed reminder failed me.

If you're not too bitter, please send a voucher.

BTW, I have a pair of moveable arm supports that my wife no longer needs.
Each clamps onto a table, has a limited height adjustment, has a padded
forearm holder and two arms with ball-bearing joints.  (They are similar,
but different from the Lab Safety Catalog number 8A-30306.)

Know anyone who could use them?

All:
  For those of you participating in the INDOEX project, or for those who are
just curious, JOSS is writing logistic Bulletins relating to many aspects of
living and working in the Maldives.  These are not specific to UCAR or ATD/RAF
personnel but are meant to answer questions and conerns for all participants,
including the PIs and others.  Because of that, they do not specifically
address RAF shipping issues, lodging, etc., but they do have information on
phones, currency and all sorts of stuff.  We will have meetings at Jeffco
to discuss RAF participation in the project, shipping dates, etc.
  Mike Heiting and I will be going on a site survey in mid-September.  We will
come back with more information on RAF operations.  In the meantime, peruse
the JOSS web site and learn all about the Maldives.

 Bruce Gandrud. The email below tells you what to fill out on the form. If you
 did not get a form you can get one from Judy. Please fill these out and return
 to Judy. (Some of you have already filled them out and returned them to me
 or Bruce G.)
   Those who need to fill them out are: Eagan, Spowart, Webster, Baumgardner,
 Campos, Daniels, Morely, Schanot, Namari, Nicoll, Towhy, Walther, Phinney,

All,

By now, those people who will be supporting INDOEX should have found a
TA form and memo in their mailbox.  I understand that there has been
some concern raised about completing these forms by the date stated on
the memo (4 December), given that some questions may remain about
specific travel schedules.

So, to go over travel schedules, per diem and lodging amounts, and any
other INDOEX travel questions that might come up, Dick and I would like
to have an INDOEX meeting this coming Friday, 4 December at 8:30 a.m. in
the conference room.  Please come with any questions you have related to
travel and completing your TA form.

Also, Dick and I have extended the deadline for getting TA forms turned
in to Jason until Wednesday, 9 December.

See you Friday morning.

Krista

Subject: Another INDOEX update
Status: RO

Attached is a summary of the last two JOSS/ATD/UCAR meetings (11/2 and
11/27).  ATD staff going into the field are strongly encouraged to read
the INDOEX Information Bulletins that JOSS has published on their web
site (http://www.joss.ucar.edu/indoex/bulletins) and to pay special
attention to visas, health and communications issues.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Maldives - General:

Presidential elections were held on Maldives in October 98 and the
President, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom was reelected.  The Office of
Environment, which was given responsibility for coordinating INDOEX
activities, is now part of the Ministry for Home Affairs, Housing and
Environment.  Although the minister and some of the contact people have
changed, the Deputy Minister, Mr. Abdullahi Majeed is still the primary
contact person for INDOEX. 
---------

INDOEX Operations Center on Hulule:

Adequate space for operations (about 4000 sq. feet) has been secured on
the airport island.

JOSS staff is presently on Hulule to set up the Operations Center. 
During this stay, they'll take care of the local network, communication
links, air conditioning, and power.  Early setup was necessary to avoid
Ramadan (20 December to 20 January).  The final setup will start on 1
February when workstations will be hooked up, forecast operations and
data ingest will begin.  Actual operations will start around 8 February
when most of the INDOEX participants will arrive.

The JOSS satellite ground station was successfully installed in October
98 and is fully operational.  

All INDOEX participants located on Hulule will need airport security
badges.  These will be issued by the airport authority upon arrival on
Male.
-----------

INDOEX Operations at the Kashidoo Observatory: 

Measurements on Kashidoo have already started.  Enhanced measurements
will start on 1 January 1999.

About 25 scientists will now be staying on Kashidoo island for the
duration of the project. Hung Nguyen at C4, is handling all arrangements
on the island (i.e., lodging, transportation, etc.) while JOSS will help
in making arrangements for people to get from Male to Kashidoo.

Kashidoo will get daily summaries from Hulule.

5000 liters of bottled water will be shipped to Kashidoo to deal with
the shortage of water there.
-----------

Logistics:

The following info bulletins are available from the JOSS web site at
http://www.joss.ucar.edu/indoex/bulletins.  Please read them!
- Communications
- Customs
- Financial Information
- Freight Shipping
- General Information on Maldive Island
- Health
- Local Transportation
- Lodging and Restaurants
- Travel to and from Maldive Island
- Travel Documents and Immigration for the Maldives
- JOSS-supported Freight Shipping
- JOSS-supported Travel


Accommodation: 
An adequate number of adequate hotel rooms was secured.  ATD staff will
be staying at the Kai Lodge, the Kam Hotel and the Relax Inn, all
located on Male.  Transportation from and to Hulule will therefore be
much less of a problem.

Shipping: 
Two seatainers with ATD equipment were shipped to Male in early
November.  The deadline for last minute air shipments is around 4
January 99 for a 4 February 99 arrival date.

Medical Treatment: 
No project doctor will be provided.  The hospital on Male seems to be
used to working with US and European patients.  In case of treatment,
the hospital will do the paperwork and bill the insurance directly so
that no out of pocket expenses occur to the patient. Participants should
check with Cyd Perrone if they are enrolled in the Accidental Death and
Dismemberment Option (ADD Option) to be covered by the Assist America
evacuation plan.  If for any reason immediate payment of a large sum of
money for treatment will be required, JOSS will have enough cash at the
Ops Center to cover medical expenses temporarily on a reimbursement
basis. Participants should provide JOSS with the name and phone number
of person to contact in case of an emergency. 

Visas: 
Visas for the Maldives are only valid for 30 days. Extensions are
available on-site but require in-person appearance at the Department of
Immigration and Emigration. For more information check the "Travel and
Immigration for the Maldives" Bulletin. For people traveling through
India it is highly recommended that they obtain a transit visa before
leaving the US.  The transit visa will be issued if an onward ticket can
be produced and is valid for 72 hours for $25.   People who will travel
through India both ways should obtain the 6-month, multiple entry visa
for $50.

Phone: 
Careful with those phone calls from Male, especially if they are made
from the hotel.   Hotels add an outrageous service charge to any phone
calls made from the hotel, raising the rate to about $10/min.  
Participants may be able to negotiate with hotel staff to have those
charges lowered or waived.  The "cheapest way" to make phone calls is by
using phone cards.  JOSS will try to install a calling box at the Ops
Center that will work with a credit card.

Ship Operations: 
India refused to issue a permit to the R/V Brown to operate in India's
Economic Exclusion Zone.  The Indian ship will start operations on 17
January.  

General Aircraft Operations: 
All aircraft (i.e., C130, Dutch Citation, French Mystere and German
Falcon) except the Geophysica will now be stationed on Male. 
Uncertainty still exists about actual arrival and departure dates and
flight time of some of the aircraft. Diplomatic clearances for the
aircraft have yet to be issued.  JOSS will meet with Indian Air Traffic
Control this month, submitting a list of instrumentation, and people and
submit a formal request for all aircraft to fly in Indian Airspace (not
in EEZ).  

C-130 operations: The C-130 schedule is as follows: 
Departure from JeffCo: 4 February; 
Arrival on Male: 12 February; 
Begin of aircraft operations: 15 February; 
End of aircraft operations: 26 March. 
The first INDOEX test flight is scheduled for 11 January 98. Satcom and
TCAS system are now installed on the aircraft.  Ten seats are available
for investigators, nine will be occupied by ATD staff.

Surface Operations: 
Surface operations have already started at the Indian sites, Mauritius,
and Kashidoo.  The Goa site, which will carry out constant level balloon
measurements, will start operations on 15 January.

Forecasting: 
In addition the Maldivian forecaster on duty, forecasting support will
be provided by the Dutch (entire period), the Indians (three weeks),
JOSS (4-6 weeks as needed) and maybe the French (Meteo France,
Mauritius). The schedule still has to be worked out but it looks like
there will be three people at any one time.

Operations Plan: 
Version 2 of the Ops Plan has been distributed to various participants.
If you haven't received a copy but want one, contact Jim Moore.   The
final version will go out in January.  The US data policy has been
revised based on an OFAP decision that US PIs are required to make data
available one year after the end of the project, i.e., 1 May 2000.   The
data policy has been endorsed by NSF but still needs ratification by the
INDOEX Steering Committee.

Gas Supply: 
Nitrogen gas and liquid nitrogen will be shipped from Singapore to Male.
The local supplier is short of cylinders, so INDOEX may have to buy two
250l containers ($2000 each) to assure continues supply.  Nitrogen is
needed by the Mainz group on the R/V Ron Brown (800l during each port
call) and by ATD. 
-----------
 
Other
Phones are in short supply on Male.  To overcome this shortage, it is
suggested that participants bring their own cell phones if they have
dual-numeric assignment module (NAM) capability. 

DON'T try to smuggle any alcohol, pork-containing products or
pornography into the country.  Male is under Islamic rule and you don't
want to be remembered as the first NCAR/ATD person to be flogged J.  
Alcohol may be permitted at the Kai Lodge, since it is fully booked by
INDOEX participants.  Once permission is granted by the Ministry,
alcohol consumption will be allowed within the four walls of one's hotel
room.

Make sure you signed up for the Accidental Death and Dismemberment
(Option ADD) to be covered by Assist America's Medical Evacuation Plan.  
Opening ceremonies will be held on 14 February 1999 at 2 pm in the VIP
lounge at the airport.  The president will attend, so bring a coat and
tie!  Invitations to all participants have not been sent yet.

Karyn Sawyer is giving a presentation on INDOEX at the 14 March 1999 
BoT Meeting in DC. Take pictures.  I promised ATD would supply some of
the pictures and data for her to show.

All,

Bill Irwin just informed me that the Electra will be flown to DIA
tomorrow (Fri., 12/4) to be washed and asked if it would be possible to
move up the time for the INDOEX travel meeting.

So, in order to accommodate those staff members who will be involved
with ferrying the Electra tomorrow, I have moved the time of the travel
meeting up to 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.  It will still be held in the
conference room.

See you then.

All:
    Next week is scheduled to be busy one for INDOEX preparation on the C-130.
At this time we hope to have the SABL test flights completed by  the end of
this week and do not anticipate anymore C-130 test flights until January.
    Most of the remaining INDOEX investigators who have instruments to install
we arrive on 12/14 or 12/15. The cabin of the C-130 will be very crowded as 
they install their equipment. I am asking for your help in managing the crowds
especially in the hangar. I am sure there will be people foraging for tools and
asking for all kinds of help with nuts and bolts, clamps, tubing, etc. Please 
help them out when you can.
    As their equipment arrives let's try and keep it confined to one area and
not spread all over the hangar. Don't be bashful to ask these folks to keep 
the hangar orderly and clean up after themselves. Also, if you see someone
doing something unsafe or breaking the RAF rules of the hangar make sure you
let them know.
    People who will be here are:

Jim Anderson, Ariz. Univ.
Armin Hansel, Univ. of Innsbruck
tony Clarke, Univ. ov Hawaii
John Porter, Univ of Hawaii
Sarah Doherty, Univ. of Wash.
Anthony Bucholtz, Scripps

and they will be accompanied by several grad students.

Thanks for your help,

All,

I just spoke with Scott Woodward in NCAR shipping, and there is going to
be a change in how our air freight shipment is delivered to Male' for
INDOEX.  According to Scott, it will not be possible for us to obtain
and ship LD3s to the Maldives.  Also, bundling boxes on pallets is not
an option.  Thus, all items will need to be shipped to Male'
individually.

This shipment system will require the following.  First, small items
should not be shipped individually.  Please place groups of small items
to be shipped into larger containers.  Second, each item to be shipped
to Male' must be clearly labelled with the correct shipping address
(Jason has prepared shipping labels) and must have a packing list inside
the container and attached to the outside of the container.

The RAF air freight shipment will be picked up here on Friday, 8
January.  Please have everything you wish to ship via air freight packed
up and correctly labelled by the end of the day Thursday, 7 January.  I
have copies of information regarding how shipment items should be
labelled (per instructions from JOSS) and will distribute this
information--along with blank packing lists--on Thursday, 31 December.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Krista

Subject: INDOEX Meeting Summary
Status: RO

Summary - INDOEX Meeting - 21 December 1998

AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS
-------------------
1) Air Traffic Control
   During last month's trip, JOSS met with staff from the Department of Civil
Aviation, External and Internal Affairs, and Defense in Delhi.  The meeting
was set up by the Deputy Director of Civil Aviation in India, who is
supportive of the project.  As a result of the meeting, INDOEX aircraft are
now allowed to fly within 50 nautical miles of the Indian coast.  An observer
is required on board the EC-130Q whenever flight operations are within 200
nautical miles of the Indian shoreline.  The observer will be located on Male
for the duration of the project.  An official letter is required from ATD
that states that a seat for the observer will be made available on the EC-130Q
for all flights that fall under this category.  Flight plans will have to be
provided directly to Air Traffic Control up to 72 hours in advance.
   A second meeting with Air Traffic Control will be held in Bombay on 28
January 1999 at 11:30 am to discuss further flight planning.  Staff from the
Bombay and Madras Air Traffic Control centers will be present at the meeting.
Representatives of the Dutch Citation and the EC-130Q are expected to attend.

2) Mystere Participation
   The French Mystere will participate in INDOEX from 27 February to 14 March
1999, flying a total of 20 hours (six or seven flights).  This short-range
Falcon aircraft will fly at 35,000 ft and coordinate its operations with the
EC-130Q.  The aircraft adds logistical complexity to the project, since it
will ferry through India and plans to refuel in South India during operations.
At the time of the meeting, neither the French nor the Dutch had requested
diplomatic flight clearances.

SHIP OPERATIONS
---------------
   The first request of the R/V Ron Brown to operate in the Indian EEC was
denied.  A modified request will be submitted that will restrict operations to
within 50 miles off shore, will limit the amount of time spent in the EEC and
will confirm that no ocean measurements are being taken.  The new request will
be handled within India with involvement of the US State Department and the
US Embassy.

OPERATIONS CENTER
-----------------
   During their last visit, JOSS staff installed computers, unified the
existing network of the Met Office, ran cables and installed hubs for the
scientists' computers, ran wires for the phone system, installed the wireless
radio network between the hangar and the Met Office, provided more electrical
power and made arrangements for the office trailer.  So far, one of three
planned incoming phone lines has been installed.  The phone system in the
Ops Center will include eight extensions and six cell phones.  As mentioned
before, it may be worthwhile to ask ATD staff to bring their own cellular
phones with them to Male.  Due to a change in policy, Air Maldives now charges
rent for the hangar space ($250/day), which will primarily affect the Dutch
group and their Citation.  Space has not been assigned yet due to insufficient
information from INDOEX participants regarding individual requirements (e.g.,
putting instrumentation on and off the aircraft, need of hazardous material,
data processing requirements, etc.).

CUSTOMS
-------
   To expedite customs clearance and to minimize delays, all notification
regarding shipments will have to go through Diane Lask at JOSS, who then will
notify the Maldivian Ministry.  Information to be provided includes packing
lists, date of arrival, airline carrier and flight number and airway bill.
Please note that the shipping bulletin also was revised.
     http://www.joss.ucar.edu/indoex/bulletins/shipping.html
As a note on the side, if your luggage is being confiscated upon arrival on
Hulule, request a receipt for your baggage and have Diane take care of the
rest.

BULLETINS
---------
   Several of the INDOEX bulletins have been either updated or added to the
INDOEX web site at JOSS.  The new bulletins are:
 * Health/Medical Insurance, Medical Evacuation Insurance and
    Workers Compensation Information
 * Operations Center Contact Information and Staff
 * JOSS-supported Travel
 * Personal Information Form which asks for Emergency Contact Info
    from participants.

BANK ACCOUNT
------------
   A bank account was set up for ad-hoc purchases and wire transfers.  The
account is available for any emergency transactions or unexpected expenses
that require transfer of money.

BADGES
------
   Badges will be issued upon arrival.  It's a several-step process that
requires several visits to the Met Office.

NITROGEN
--------
   Uncertainty still exists regarding the supply of liquid and gaseous
nitrogen.  No supplier is available on Male, and arrangements for shipment
from Sri Lanka will have to be made.

LODGING
-------
   A new hotel, the Central Hotel, with similar facilities and rates as the
other hotels, just opened on Male near the downtown area.  The new hotel
will ease hotel room shortage during INDOEX, especially for short-term
participants.  Please read the updated Lodging Bulletin to obtain phone
and fax numbers in case you plan to stay there.
     http://www.joss.ucar.edu/indoex/bulletins/lodging.html

OPENING CEREMONIES
------------------
   Ceremonies are still planned for 14 February. Official invitations have
not gone out yet.

DATA POLICY
-----------
   The INDOEX International Steering Committee has agreed to the US request
that all INDOEX data be released one year after the IOP.  A password will be
required to access INDOEX data during the first year.  The INDOEX PIs still
have to submit a written request to the ATD Director to restrict ATD data
access for a one-year period.

More information for those of you preparing items for shipment out this
Friday to the Maldives in our air freight shipment.

You'll notice on the blank packing list forms I handed out that there is
a line labelled "Handling Agent in Maldives" at the top of each form.
It is critical that you fill this line out, as this information will be
used to contact our handler in the Maldives and get them to clear the
various boxes from customs.

According to Scott in Shipping, the following handler information should
be written in the above blank:

AEI/Oriental Express

That is the company that will be acting as our handler in the Maldives.

Last, Scott also informed me that he has scheduled an early p.m. pickup
at the RAF on Friday.  However, he needs all of the paperwork (i.e.,
packing lists copies) by Thursday, 1/7 if at all possible.  So, please
have all of your packing lists *completely* filled out by the middle of
the afternoon on Thursday, and give a copy of each to me at that time so
that I can forward copies on to Scott.

Thanks, and let me know if you have any questions on the above.

All,

As you may or may not know, there will be an additional INDOEX air
freight shipment going out of Jeffco on Friday, 29 January.  This will
be the last major air freight shipment to the Maldives prior to the
departure of the C-130 for the project.

In preparation for this shipment, I would like to ask that any RAF staff
member needing to include items in this shipment please email me (by
Wed., 20 January) the number of items that he/she will be including in
the shipment.  This will enable me to get an idea of how large the
shipment will be.

Thanks.

Status: RO

All --

Before the departure of the C-130 and several staff members for the
Maldives this week, I wanted to make sure all RAF staff members have the
following information regarding how items should be shipped to the
INDOEX project.

The following two points should be noted:

1)  All items--whether shipped normally or shipped express--must be sent
to the following address:

     INDOEX PROJECT - HULULE
     Ministry of Home Affairs, Housing and Environment
     Environment Research Centre
     Huravee Building
     Ameeru Ahmed Magee
     Male' 20-05
     Republic of Maldives

     For:  Name of recipient

Items shipped to this address will be "helped" through customs by Mr.
Zuhair of the above-listed ministry.  Once an item has cleared customs,
he will notify the person listed by "For" above that the item is ready
to be picked up or to arrange for its delivery to the research site.

NOTE:  ALL ITEMS BEING SHIPPED TO THE MALDIVES MUST HAVE A PACKING LIST
ATTACHED, AND THE PACKING LIST MUST BE TYPED IN ORDER TO INSURE THAT IT
IS LEGIBLE.  A copy of the packing list (in Excel spreadsheet format)
can be downloaded from the JOSS Web page by going to the following site:

http://www.joss.ucar.edu/indoex/bulletins/shipping.html

Once you have prepared an item for shipment and it is on its way to the
Maldives, please email the person receiving the shipment any relevant
information for the shipment (shipping company, invoice/tracking number,
etc.) so that they can alert the Ministry and JOSS in the Maldives that
a package is on its way.

2)  Express shipping to the Maldives is possible using DHL.  An express
shipment from Colorado to the Maldives is expected to take 3-4 days.
Judy Wade has had a new account set up with DHL to cover DHL shipments
going out from Jeffco to Male'.  Dick Friesen and I will need to get a
separate DHL account set up for the express shipment of items from Male'
to Jeffco once we arrive in the Maldives.

Some additional paperwork and steps are required in order to send an
express package via DHL.  Judy has copies of all of the forms that must
be filled out, so see her for these and for assistance.  Also, please
note that you must also fill out a packing list (see instructions in 1
above) to accompany the shipment.

Once the shipment has been prepared, fax a copy of the packing list and
the DHL tracking number to Diane Lask (JOSS) in the Maldives.  This
information can be faxed to Diane at her hotel, the Relax Inn (Fax No.
011-960-314533).  Diane will then pass this information off to Mr.
Zuhair in the Ministry office, and he will help to clear the DHL package
through customs and get it delivered to the correct person.

Please retain this email message so that you have a record of the above
shipping directions.

All,

I forgot to mention one additional item in my email regarding INDOEX
shipping instructions.

Please work through Judy with all shipments to go out from Jeffco to the
Maldives.  This way, Judy can keep a record of the number of shipments
going out to the Maldives and can notify those of us in the field as to
when something is headed our way.  Also, Judy can assist you with
completing the necessary forms and can fax forms off to us in the
Maldives as needed.

Thanks!

Krista

Subject: INDOEX EC-130Q Status Report -- 18 February 1999
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Length: 8836
Status: RO

All,

Greetings from the Maldives, where it's presently sunny, hot, and humid,
but then again, it's sunny, hot and humid here every day.

The EC-130Q arrived at Male' International Airport on schedule on Friday,
12 February.  The first official day of research operations for the aircraft
was this past Monday, 15 February.

The first EC-130Q research flight was flown on Tuesday, 16 February.  A total
of 8.1 hours were flown on that date.  This first mission was designated as
a radiative closure/cloud sampling study.  As we send this out, the EC-130Q
is up in the air flying RF02.  Discussion is also underway to carry out RF03
tomorrow.

In general, the first research flight went fairly well.  The individual
EC-130Q PIs seemed generally pleased with the performance of their
instruments.  There were some problems with some instruments and with
the aircraft data system, and we outline these below:

  1)  ADS (the aircraft data system) did not boot properly for several
  minutes early on in the flight.  Approximately 30 minutes of data were
  lost during this period; however, the data system was operating properly
  and recording data with no problems prior to the start of the actual
  research legs of the flight.  The cause of the boot problems was not
  determined.
  
  2)  Problems were encountered with the IRIG-B signals sent out to several
  "independent" instruments on the aircraft.  Operators of the AIMR, SABL,
  and the Shetter radiometers noted that the time signals received by their
  respective instruments were often bad (i.e., bad time stamps of 42 hours
  were sent out, numbers in the date were reversed, etc.).  Some time was
  spent looking into this problem yesterday (Wed., 2/17/99); however, no
  definite cause has been located.  At present, it is believed that one fix
  for the problem is for each user receiving an IRIG feed to implement a
  software work-around whereby their instrument initializes time with the
  IRIG feed at startup but then "free wheels" (i.e., uses its own clock
  for time stamps) for the remainder of the flight.
  
  3)  The FSSP-100 probe flown on the right wing pod and the FSSP-300 probe
  each experienced problems during RF01.  There were basically no data from
  the FSSP-100, and the FSSP-300 displayed data only up to about 5 um.  Both
  probes were removed from the aircraft on Wed., 2/17/99 to be worked on.  In
  the case of the 300, the alignment was checked and the optics were cleaned.
  It was also determined that some wires on the photodetector board were
  broken, which may have caused the data dropout.  The FSSP-300 was remounted
  on the aircraft, and Dick Friesen and I will determine after today's flight
  if the problem has been fixed.  Work was done on the right pod FSSP-100,
  also, and it is believed that the RF01 problems were fixed.  Again, we'll
  know more after today's flight.  There is still some question regarding the
  quality of the data from the FSSP-100 probe being flown on the left wing
  pod.  While the data collected during RF01 appear to be okay, we have
  received word that there may be a problem with the housekeeping data
  collected for this probe.
  
  The PCASP worked fine during the flight.  While primarily small drops were
  encountered during cloud penetrations, a few images did show up in flight
  from the 2D-C and 2D-P probes.  Thus, the latter two instruments appear
  to be working okay.
  
  4)  The MASP worked during RF01 with the exception of a data dropout between
  0.9 and approximately 2.0 um.  Darrel has been notified of this problem, and
  Bruce Gandrud here at INDOEX has also been brought into the loop.  Bruce G.
  believes that the dropout problem is related to certain bins in the
  instrument data stream being processed incorrectly by software.  More
  work will be done here to look into this problem and, hopefully, solve it.
  
  5)  Channel 2 (0.763 um) of the MCR failed in flight.  Also, microphonic
  noise is present in channel 6 (2.16 um) of the instrument.  Mike Spowart
  worked on the MCR yesterday; however, channel 2 worked fine during ground
  tests, and the failure could not be repeated.  We'll see how the instrument
  performed during today's flight.
  
  6)  SABL worked only intermittently during the flight, and, as of yesterday
  (afer the instrument was pulled from the pod and worked on here in our
  office), it is not operational until further notice.  Craig Walther, Rick
  Parsons, and Al Phinney determined that a pin had burned up on a connector,
  and a new connector must be located back in the states and shipped here to
  the Maldives.  At present, we do not have an estimate as to when SABL will
  be back on line on the aircraft.

From a logistical standpoint, there have been some bumps in the road since the
arrival of RAF staff and the aircraft.  We have been given office space which
amounts to roughly half of what we originally requested.  All of our (RAF
and RSF) computers are now set up and running, but our office accommodations
are definitely a bit crowded.  (Perhaps some would call it "cozy.")  Matters
are complicated somewhat by the fact that we (the EC-130Q support group) are
located in the Air Maldives hangar, which is about a 5-minute walk from the
INDOEX operations center where the aircraft PIs are located.  The EC-130Q
is parked even farther away from our office here.  It is located on the
international ramp roughly a quarter of a mile away from the EC-130Q
operations office.  We do have a truck which is dedicated for use by the
EC-130Q group, and that's been a real lifesaver in terms of shuttling people
and equipment between the aircraft, the main ops center and our office.

Another complicating factor has been the fact that, as of this writing, no
direct phone line has been provided for us here in our Air Maldives office.
Dick and I are working on getting such a line in place, but we've so far had
no luck.  Dick and I have a cellular phone that's been provided for our use by
JOSS, and that's presently our only phone link either to the main ops center
and to the "outside world."  Should anyone need to reach the EC-130Q group,
Judy Wade has the cell phone number.  You also can call the main ops center
(again, Judy has the number) and leave a message for a member of the EC-130Q
crew with the JOSS staff member who answers.

The seatainer office that was to be built for RAF staff has still not been
completed.  It has been moved underneath a shade tree near the aircraft
parking area.  However, the work to install a door, windows, power and an
air conditioner still has not been started.  Dick and I are still pushing
on people here to try to get that done.  We succeeded today in having one of
our empty transport seatainers moved over to the aircraft parking area.  This
will enable us to store aircraft and instrument spares closer to the EC-130Q.

The last problem we're tackling here has to do with getting liquid nitrogen
(LN2) delivered to us from Sri Lanka.  The German dewar arrived early last
week; however, it was 80% empty upon arrival, and we have since almost used
up all of its contents.  The newly-purchased RAF dewar was, as of yesterday,
filled and sitting at Industrial Gases (the supplier) in Colombo.  They
were refraining from shipping it due to the fact that they hadn't been paid
for filling and shipping the German dewar.  It is our understanding (as of
this afternoon) that money has been wired to Industrial Gases to cover the
outstanding bill, so hopefully the RAF dewar is now on its way here to Male'.
However, it will not arrive until Saturday at the earliest.  We'll know more
after today's flight about how much (if any) LN2 remains in the 34-liter LN2
dewar on the EC-130Q.  The lack of LN2 will, of course, impact our ability
to operate the MCR and the Valero NFOV radiometer during any flights prior
to the arrival of the filled dewar from Colombo.  Dick F. and I are working
with Nimal Gamage of JOSS to try to make sure that we get a definite payment
procedure and regular LN2 shipping schedule in place as soon as possible so
as to avoid any instrument operational restrictions in the coming weeks.

The INDOEX opening ceremony was held this past Monday morning.  The President
of the Maldives was in attendance, and after the ceremony, he toured the
EC-130Q and the Dutch Citation.  Also in attendance were the U.S. Ambassador
to Sri Lanka and several other dignitaries.  The President is extremely
interested in the INDOEX project and was very interested in all of the
instruments on the aircraft and in the flight operations to be carried out.
All in all, our hosts here in the Maldives are very gracious.

That's all for now.  The heat and humidity make work on and around the EC-130Q
challenging, but we're all doing well.  And I think we've all decided that the
boat rides to and from the airport here are a pretty pleasant way to commute
to and from work.

Content-Length: 5001
Status: RO

All,

Hello again from the Maldives.  Today's weather:  hot, humid, and
still.  Note how the weather is really no different from the last time
we sent out this report.

Following is the flight hours status since the last time we emailed out
a project status report:

RF03 (flown 2/20/99) -- 8.9
RF04 (flown 2/24/99) -- 9.2
RF05 (flown 2/25/99) -- 9.4

Total research hours flown to date (RF01-RF05) -- 44.7

RF06 is being flown as we write this.  Today's mission is a cloud study
being flown northwest of Male', and the flight will be about 9 hours in
length.  Provided everything goes as planned, some brief intercomparison
legs will be flown at the end of today's mission with the Dutch
Citation.

While in general the RAF instrumentation has performed well to date,
there have been a few problems during some of the research flights.  A
brief summary of problems for research flights 3-5 is given below:

RF03
------
1)  FSSP-100 on right wing not working--fixed post-flight;
2)  CO not working--fixed post-flight;
3)  MCR channels 1, 2, 6 and 7 not working--channels 1 and 2 fixed
post-flight;
4)  VLA quit working in flight; sensor and electronics replaced after
flight.

RF04
------
1)  PLWC not working;
2)  FSSP-100 on left wing reading low during flight;
3)  PCASP data questionable;
4)  All MCR channels except for 7 working; channel 6 dropped out for
brief periods of time during flight;
5)  CN data displayed noise spiking--despiking algorithm used in
post-flight processing;
6)  260X data okay, but post-flight alignment needed.

VLA working during RF04.

RF05
------
1)  PLWC not working; problem fixed post-flight;
2)  PCASP still questionable during flight;

We are still going over the data for this flight and will summarize
problems at a later date.

Work was carried out yesterday on several of the PMS probes to address
some of the above problems.  The PCASP, FSSP-100 (left wing), and 260X
were all checked out thoroughly and returned to operational status by
the end of the day.

Prior to RF04, the green (0.532 um) channel of SABL was brought back on
line.  SABL worked with this channel only during RF04.  During RF05,
SABL quit operating approximately 45 minutes into the flight.  The
failure occurred when the instrument was changed to down-looking mode.
Yesterday, however, the green channel was again working on the ground,
and it remains to be seen how the instrument performs during today's
mission.

As of this writing, we've made headway in solving some of the logistical
problems.  The seatainer office for use of RAF staff has been completed
(power, lights, air conditioner, door and window all installed and
exterior painted white).  Both the RAF 240 liter LN2 dewar and the
German 200 liter LN2 dewar arrived from Sri Lanka, so we're presently
well-stocked with LN2.  Hopefully, a shipment and payment plan for
replenishing our LN2 supply has been put in place and will work smoothly
for the remainder of the project.  Our first shipment of five empty
gaseous N2 cylinders went out this morning, so we'll see how our system
of shipping the cylinders to Sri Lanka for filling works.  Stay tuned
for further updates.

Some logistical problems remain, however.  We still have been
unsuccessful in getting a direct phone line put into our office.  We're
still putting pressure on the manager of the Air Maldives Engineering
Hangar (where our office is located) to get this done, but the person in
charge of getting the work done is now out of the country.  We are also
still facing an occasional problem of getting the C-130 out of here on
time for mission takeoffs.  The problem there has to do with the fact
that the international ramp (where we're parked) is quite busy on some
days with both cargo transport planes and commercial jets taking up the
ramp.  We have been asked to inform the ramp manager of our takeoff
plans the day before, which we do diligently.  It is then the
responsibility of the ramp manager to make sure that aircraft are parked
in such a manner that the C-130 has the necessary room to taxi out on
time.  However, we've found ourselves pinned in on a few occasions now,
as happened to us this morning.  Takeoff was delayed by about 30 minutes
while we waited for a passenger jet to take off and a Russian transport
plane to be moved down the ramp out of our way.  Jim Moore of JOSS is
working on setting up a meeting with the various ramp and airport
officials so that we can discuss this matter again and hopefully come to
some resolution regarding how everyone can be accommodated on the ramp.

That's about all for now.  The boat rides to and from the airport are
still proving to be quite enjoyable, and we're all becoming quite expert
at hopping from the piers to the boats (and vice versa) while laden down
with briefcases, laptops, and other bags.  And we're happy to report
that, so far, no one has fallen into the water while attempting boat
embarking/disembarking maneuvers.  Let's hope that trend continues.

Dick F. and Krista

Subject: INDOEX EC-130Q Status Report -- 5 March 1999
Status: RO

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

All,

Time once again for the weekly status report.  Actually, this will be the
last INDOEX EC-130Q report sent out by Dick Friesen and me, as our replacement
project managers (Allen Schanot and Bruce Morley) arrive late tonight and will
take over from us after our departure this coming Monday.  Oh, and I think
we'll forego our weekly weather report this time around ... everyone gets
one guess as to what the weather conditions are here at present.  (Hint:
the words cold and snow do not apply.)

Following is the flight hours status since last week's status report was
emailed out:

RF06 (flown 2/27/99) -- 9.0
RF07 (flown 2/28/99) -- 6.4
RF08 (flown 3/4/99) -- 8.9

Total research hours flown to date (RF01-RF08) -- 69.0

During yesterday's mission (RF08), engine 2 began leaking oil and needed to
be shut down when the EC-130Q was approximately 1.5 hours from landing at
Male' International Airport.  Today's planned flight was cancelled following
an assessment by the mechanics yesterday evening that more time was needed
today to attempt to locate the leak and possibly fix it.  As we write this,
the mechanics are working on the engine, and we hope to hear soon what the
status is and what type of repair will be required.  More information on this
will be passed along as it becomes available.

[Begin update via email message sent Fri, 05 Mar 1999 03:27:09 -0700]
A high speed engine run up was done today to further look at the problem.
This test resulted in oil spraying out on to the ramp, and the problem is
believed to be due to a broken/leaking seal in engine 2.  Thus, the decision
has been made to replace the engine with the spare that was shipped here to
Male'.

Work on this engine swap has begun.  A heavy-duty crane will soon be brought
to the EC-130Q to be used to remove the prop and engine for number 2, and RAF
crew are presently working on moving the replacement engine from the seatainer
here at the Air Maldives hangar to the EC-130Q parking area on the ramp.

The present estimate is that four working days will be required to complete
the engine swap and to test out the new engine on board the aircraft.  Under
this schedule, the aircraft will not be back "on line" for potential research
operations until Tuesday, 9 March.  Dick F. and I, and Allen and Bruce Morley,
will continue to update you all on a daily basis on the progress of the work
here.
[End of update]

A brief summary of instrument problems encountered during RF06-RF08 is given
below:

RF06
----
1)  Data system crash approximately halfway through flight -- about 30 minutes
     of data lost;
2)  MASP DSM gave disconnect messages continuously -- instrument turned off in
     an attempt to solve the problem;
3)  Gerber probe not operable -- source of problem not located post-flight;
4)  Oscillations in PCASP data detected;
5)  Disagreement between two FSSP-100 probes -- a general problem for all
     research flights to date;
6)  TEP (ozone instrument sampling pressure) questionable.

RF07
------
1)  Oscillations in PCASP data still present;
2)  Disagreement between two FSSP-100 probes.

RF08
------
1)  PCASP oscillations present;
2)  FSSP-100 discrepancies still present;
3)  Gerber inoperable -- possibly left in calibration mode for entire flight.

We're still looking at the data from RF08, so more information about
instrument performance during that flight will become available at a
later time.

In general, work continues here to try to figure out the source of the PCASP
data oscillations and to understand what's causing the discrepancies between
the two FSSP-100s.

While the MCR data collected during yesterday's flight (RF08) have not been
examined yet, it appears that channels 1-6 are now performing quite well.
At the request of Jim Coakley, the gains of channels 4 and 5 were adjusted
(increased for 4 and decreased for 5) in an attempt to fine-tune the data
collected from those channels.  A perusal of yesterday's data will reveal
if those adjustments were successful or not.  The channel 7 dewar arrived
yesterday from Colorado, and John Cowan will be asked to install it in the
instrument as soon as time to do so becomes available.

SABL appears to have worked fairly well during the most recent research
flights, although only the green channel is presently functional.  Efforts
to get the second (IR) channel working have, as of this writing, not been
successful.  Work on that issue continues.  According to the RSF staff members
working here (Craig Walther, Al Phinney, and Rick Parsons), the AIMR has thus
far worked extremely well during the project.

At the halfway mark of the EC-130Q deployment, we are still without a direct
phone line into our office.  The cell phone assigned to Dick F. and I has
become our office phone, and it is our present opinion that this will remain
the case for the duration of the project.  The problems we reported last week
about "overcrowding" on the ramp when we were trying to launch the aircraft
have, we believe, been solved.  After sending out last week's status report,
we met again with the various ramp officers and worked out a plan for both
parking all of the relevant aircraft (the EC-130Q, the newly-arrived French
Mystere, and the various Russian cargo planes) so that the aircraft each can
get out as required and for insuring that the ramp officers are aware of our
(EC-130Q) flight plans well in advance of planned takeoff times.

So, as the sun sets into the west (okay, that happens a few hours from now),
we are preparing to hand the reins of EC-130Q management over to Allen and
Bruce M.  To give you all a feel for our "digs" here in the Maldives, we've
attached a JPEG image showing a few of us EC-130Q support team members here
in our data processing office (what we affectionately refer to as the "central
nervous system" of the INDOEX EC-130Q deployment effort).  It's not Club Med,
but at least we have an ocean view.  Enjoy, and we'll see you all back in
Boulder in just a few days!

Dick, Allen, Krista

When archiving the first 8 flight's of raw ADS data tapes to the Mass Store,
I found that RF08 had only an EOF and no data.  I was given only one of the
two tapes that were generated for each flight, so I don't know whether the
other tape for RF08 is OK or not.  The other 7 flight tapes have data, and
I have been archiving them in 1GB cbunks.

Since the possibility exists that the master flight ADS tapes may contain no
data,  I think it would be a good idea to check them before erasing the data
from a disk version of the flight.  If the second tape for RF08 is around,
will someone please get it to me or check it for real data.

Thanks.

Hi Ron:

    We still have the ADS image from flight rf08 on disk here......if the disk
survived.  No way
    to look at our copy of the tape until Marley is back up.   No estimate on
that for now.

This is a bit worrisome.  Unfortunately, the other tape copy of the RF08 data is
still in the Maldives with Allen and Bruce M., so we'll have to wait to check
this out until after they get back.

Allen and Bruce, do you happen to know if the RF08 ADS image (the one recorded
on the removable drive) is still on Marley or Caddis somewhere?  If so, can you
make sure that it gets left on the disk and/or transferred to an Exabyte tape to
get brought back here to Jeffco?  Thanks.

Krista

Allen,

I was really asking you to check ALL the tapes to make sure data were
written to them.  If one tape was blank, ... ?

Krista, Ron and Dick,

I don't know what tape you have labeled as RF08 but we have R1327 and a copy of
R1327 and they are labeled RF08.  Both of them have data on them.  We also have
102rf08.ads on /home/data and have made a copy of this on /home/data2 even though
this does not seem necessary because we have two tapes.  My question is what tape
number do you have for flight 8?  Is it R1328?  That tape number is missing from
the original data tapes and the copy tapes and it does not appear on any of the
Flight Data Reports.

I am going to delete the raw data from the first 7 flights here so we can have room
for the data from the more recent flights.

Flight 16 is in the air right now and tomorrow is a no fly or a hard down day.  Two
flights to go but who is counting.

Bruce

Bruce,

That's OK.  Those data are presently being archived here, and the data on
them are fine.

The tape I have that is labeled RF08 is, indeed, R1328.

Ron,

The first group of INDOEX raw data files is ready to be archived to the
MSS.  The files are in /home/data and are for RF01.  There were two data
tapes for this flight, so there are several different files that need to
be sent up to the MSS.

The file names are as follows:

102rf01X.Y, where X=a or b and Y=ads, 2D, or MASP

The "a" files are for the first data tape (R1318), and the "b" files are
for the second (R1319).

I have renamed the raw MCR data files to the following:

102rf01.rawMCRZ, where Z=a, b, or c.

I changed the file names to the above because the original output file
names were two confusing.  You won't need to know this for archival
purposes, but the "a" MCR file is from tape R1318, and the "b" and "c"
files are from R1319.

Please send these files up to the MSS as soon as possible and let me
know when they have been archived so that I can begin on the next tape.
Unfortunately, it looks like we're only going to be able to get one
flight at a time on /home/data.

Thanks for your help.

Krista

Ron,

Okay, the data files for INDOEX RF02 have been downloaded and are in
/home/data, ready to go up to the MSS.

Per usual, the filename convention is as follows:  102rf02.X, where
X=2D, MASP, ads, rawMCRa, rawMCRb, or rawMCRc.

Same drill as usual.  Let me know when you've archived them up to the
MSS, and I'll start working on RF03.

Thanks!

Krista

Here's the message from Phil Hignett that can be used to construct the SST 
correction.  I have tried it.  It works quite well.


the readme file below explains the procedure and a second message will 
follow containg the TMPTORAD.DAT file.

************************************************************************  
***********
The basic principle of the need to apply a correction is described by the 
following equation:
Ndet = e*B(Tsea) + r*Nsky                  (1)
Ndet=radiance received by the radiometer viewing the sea surface. 
 B(Tsea)=the black body emission fron the sea surface at the true 
temperature Tsea.
Nsky=radiance of the sky which will be reflected into the field-of-view of 
the radiometer.  e=the emissivity of the sea surface.  r=the reflectivity 
of the surface (=1-e).
Therefore if Nsky is characteristic of a temperature cooler than the sea 
then Ndet will correspond to a temperature lower than the true Tsea. If the 
aircraft radiometer is viewing at nadir then the reflected radiance will be 
that of the zenith. For a clear sky there is a significant variation of 
radiance with zenith angle (as the water vapour path varies), being least 
at zenith. The problem therefore is to estimate this zenith radiance from 
the hemispheric irradiance measured by the pyrgeometer. Under a complete 
low cloud cover there is little significant angular variation in sky 
radiance and the magnitude of the non-blackness error is also smallest.
All the terms in (1) have to be convoluted with the normalised spectral 
response of the radiometer in use. I have approximated this from the 
manufacturer's information and digitised it at one wavenumber intervals.  I 
think a value for the emissivity of 0.990 is probably appropriate to your 
data but you may be able to get some other guidance on this.
To estimate Nsky from L, the downward irradiance measured by the upper 
pyrgeometer, effectively what you have to do is work out the constants in 
the following relation:
Nsky = a*L + b
where a= (c*Lmax-d*Lmin)/(Lmax-Lmin)
and b= -e*Lmax*Lmin/(Lmax-Lmin)
I have calculated the numerical factors c,d,e  for a number of model 
atmospheres; on any given day these could be different from the actual 
conditions but I have found there is not a great sensitivity to small 
differences.
Atmosphere           c           d          e

Tropical          0.03946     0.01828     0.02118
Mid-lat summer    0.03921     0.01356     0.02565
Mid-lat winter    0.03702     0.00466     0.03236
Sub-arctic summer 0.03758     0.00962     0.02796
Sub-arctic winter 0.03568     0.00329     0.03239


Lmax and Lmin you will have to extract from your data. Lmax is the largest 
value of downward irradiance you would expect from your pyrgeometer in the 
area of operation (effectively corresponding to a complete low overcast); 
Lmin is the smallest clear sky value you would expect. It is important that 
these values are representative of your actual aircraft data.
The actual procedure is then very simple. The file TMPTORAD.DAT is a 
listing of the radiometer radiance (Ndet in W/m2/steradian) corresponding 
to a range of temperatures from 270K to 310K, which should suffice for most 
purposes. Re-arranging (1) gives:
B(Tsea) = (Ndet-r*Nsky)/e            (2)
For each temperature measured by the radiometer you work out the 
corresponding value of Ndet from TMPTORAD (interpolating linearly) and Nsky 
from the corresponding value of L. Equation (2) then gives you a value for 
B; referring back to TMPTORAD you find the new temperature corresponding to 
B. This temperature is then Tsea, the corrected temperature. It is 
straightforward to produce a simple program to apply this each point in a 
time series.

Guess what, Ron?!  I've got more INDOEX data files ready to go up to the
MSS!  Yeah, I can tell you're excited.

At any rate, the files for RF03 are in /home/data and are ready to go
up.  The usual naming convention:  102rf03.X, where X=2D, MASP, ads,
rawMCRa, rawMCRb, or rawMCRc.

Let me know when they're archived and I'll proceed on to the next tape.

Dick -- in case you're chomping at the bit to start on low-rate
processing, I'm leaving the ADS images in /home/data.  So far, the
images for RF02 and RF03 are there and ready for use.  Unfortunately, I
deleted the ADS image for RF01, so that will have to be brought back
down from the MSS.

Ron,

The data files for INDOEX RF04 are in /home/data and are ready to go up
to the MSS.  MASP, ads, 2D, and rawMCR files are all there.

I will be gone all of next week and have given the rest of the RF01-RF08
tapes to Dick F.  You'll need to check with him to see if he plans to
work on stripping the data files off of those tapes next week.

Krista

   I am currently running dnload to stage the ADS, MASP, MCR and 2D images to
home data.
   These should be done this afternoon. I will be at the panel meeting this
afternoon (Monday) and maybe all day tomorrow, so if you get a chance see if
the files are there and move them to the MSS. Thanks.

Bruce and Ron,
I thought I would send you a "heads-up" on this INDOEX EEZ request.
Gandrud will probably follow up with you anyway. Bruce, do you need
anything more from me other than the list of coordinates and list
of flights I gave you in Male? Let me know when the data set is
ready, and I'll make arrangements or let you know where to send it.
Are you planning a CD(s) or exabyte tape? My view is if you can
extract data from the on-board C-130 1-sec database, that should be
sufficient and should fit on a CD. ASCII would be easiest for the
Indians to deal with, but NetCDF should work if easiest.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Steve Williams

  Thanks for taking care of this. I am stuck up at the panel meeting. If you 
get a chance and want to, you could remove the RF05 tape from the drive and
put it back on the box on my desk. Also, remove all of the files asssocicated
with RF05 except the ads. Then, again if you wish, stage in RF07 using 
dnload. It is easy to run and is self prompting. (skip rf06 for now.)

Thanks, see you later.

Subject: RF09 INDOEX Files

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Length: 630
Status: RO

Hi Ron,

Okay, the first set of files for INDOEX RF09 are in /home/data and are
ready to go up to the MSS.  Note that there are two data tapes for
RF09.  The files presently in /home/data are from the download of Tape
1.  Because /home/data is now at 95% capacity, I will have to wait to
download Tape 2 until after you have archived the first set of files to
the MSS.

The filename convention for the first RF09 files is as follows:
102rf09a.X, where X=ads, MASP, 2D, rawMCRa, or rawMCRb.

Let me know as soon as you've archived these first files, and I'll
remove them and move on to the second tape for RF09.

Thanks!

Krista

Ron,

The second set of files for INDOEX RF09 are in /home/data and ready to
go up to the MSS.  These files are for the second data tape for the
flight and following this naming convention:  102rf09b.X, where X=ads,
2D, MASP, and rawMCRa.

Let me know when they've been archived, and I'll proceed on to the next
flight.

Thanks!

Krista

Via today's noon mail pickup at Jeffco I will be sending you the following
sixteen (16) 8mm tapes for archiving to the SCD Mass Store System:
 
     R1327, R1329 - R1338 and R1340 - R1344
 
Please be aware that these tapes are for "read only."  Unlike ordinary
audio and video tapes, a black "hole" actually makes these tapes writeable.
Therefore, the red, write-enable flag will be in the exposed (ERASE OFF)
position.  Do NOT change the position of this flag.  If a tape seems to
be write enabled, contact me immediately.
 
Please let me know when they are ready to read.
Thanks.  :)

Chris,

This morning, I ran dnload on the INDOEX RF11 tape and encountered the
following error message after several minutes:

READ ERROR, errno = 5

This error occurred after block number 112717.  Downloading stopped at
about 07:25 GMT.

Can you tell me what the above error message indicates about the tape?
I just checked the flight log for RF11, and according to that, the C-130
didn't end the flight until 12:18 GMT.  So, right now, we can't get to
about 4.5 hours of flight data.

Ron -- please use the RF11 files with caution that you've just archived
to the MSS.  After I find out from Chris what the above problem might
be, I might be re-downloading the raw files from the tape.

Krista

Krista,

I was surprised to see such smallfiles.  I can always rearchive them if
necessary.  I have the second copy of the INDOEX tapes at ML for archiving
the normal way.  If you need RF11 back, I can defer archiving it until
later.

Ron,

Just wanted to let you know that I'm going to remove the INDOEX RF11
files from /home/data and move on to downloading the files from RF12.
I'll go back and re-do RF11 once the other tape has been returned from
the Mesa Lab.

Krista,

OK.  I hope to have the tape images archived by the middle of next week.
If you need the RF11 tape before then, let me know, and I can defer archiving
it until later.

Okay, Ron.  The files for INDOEX RF12 are in /home/data and are ready to
go up to the MSS.

If you can, please see that the RF11 tape presently up at ML gets sent
back here to the RAF as soon as it has been archived.  In the mean time,
I'll simply continue with the downloading of the files for flights RF13
and on.

Ron,

The raw data files from INDOEX RF15 are in /home/data and are ready to
go up to the MSS.

Note that there are two data tapes for RF15, so there are two groupings
of files for RF15, labelled either "a" or "b".  The basic file names for
2D, MASP, ADS, and MCR data are the same.

Let me know when they're archived and I'll move on to RF16.  Thanks!

Krista

Ron,

The raw data files for INDOEX RF16 are in /home/data and are ready to be
archived to the MSS.  Note that there are three data tapes for this
flight, so there are three different groups of files in /home/data.
They are labelled "a", "b", and "c".

Let me know when they've been archived.  Thanks!

Krista

applied for and got a new RAS account.

Via today's noon mail pickup at Jeffco I will be sending you the following
two (2) 8mm tapes for archiving to the SCD Mass Store System:
 
     R1339 and R1343

I put them in an ordinary yellow mail envelope this time.
 
Please be aware that these tapes are for "read only."  Unlike ordinary
audio and video tapes, a black "hole" actually makes these tapes writeable.
Therefore, the red, write-enable flag will be in the exposed (ERASE OFF)
position.  Do NOT change the position of this flag.  If a tape seems to
be write enabled, contact me immediately.
 
Please let me know when they are ready to read.
Thanks.  :)

Let me know after you've archived them, and I'll get started on the next

Okay, it worked on this tape (copy of R1332).  The raw data files for

Ron,

The raw data files for INDOEX RF18 are in /home/data and are ready for
archival.  Note that there were three tapes for this flight, so there
are three groups of files (labelled a, b, and c) in /home/data.  The
RF18 files represent the last of the raw files needing to be archived.

Dick -- All of the raw files for INDOEX are now (or will be soon)
archived on the MSS.  So, you and Allen should everything that you
need.  With the exception of a couple of files, the ADS image for each
flight have been left down here on our system.  Look in either
/home/data or /home/data/indoex for ADS images that you need during
processing of the data.  If you don't find the image you need, I
probably removed it by mistake, and you'll need to bring down a copy
from the MSS.

Krista

			INDOEX Debrief Summary
			 RAF Conference Room
		 	   15 April 1999
				0830



All in all, INDOEX will be viewed as an exceptional success.  Most or all
of the original scientific objectives were addressed by one or more research
flights.   On-board systems, both ATD and User supplied instrumentation,
functioned fairly well following some initial problems.  The total allotment
of 160 research flight hours were flown during 18 missions flown out of the 
international airport in Male'.  The off site deployment to Mauritius, 
included in the original project planning,  was canceled by the INDOEX
steering committee as being unnecessary.  Due to unusual positioning of the 
ITCZ, clean air sampling of southern hemispheric air was possible during
round robin flights out of Male'.

The following summary covers issues raised during the meeting in general
terms.  Detailed discussions of the most important issues were defered to
three separate and specific "topic" meetings to be held in the next two to
three weeks.  Mike Spowart will convene a meeting on ADS and onboard display
problems.  Mike Heiting will organize a meeting on safety and policy issues.
Allen Schanot & Dick Taylor will target C-130 infrastucture changes and
improvements.  If you wish to participate in any of these meetings, please
contact the relavent person for information on meeting schedules.



1)  Travel / Housing

	Transportation and housing presented some interesting problems.
	But, with excellent help from the RAF support staff, we were able
	to complete the program without any major difficulties.

2)  JOSS Interface

	In general the coordination with JOSS went fairly well.  There
	was some initial confusion over logistical support, primarily
	on-site preparations.  In the future, there should be a more clearly
        defined and detailed understanding of what JOSS has arranged to provide
        for ATD and what ATD must directly contract for. This includes items
        such as office/lab/storage space, telephone service, networks,aircraft
        services. To expedite the process and avoid confusion ATD may elect to
	make its own arrangements directly and use JOSS to identify local
	points of contact.  The interactions during flight operations
	went smoothly.  Good communications and close coordination are
	essential during the early planning phases of these international
	deployments, particularly in dealing with local air traffic 
	authoritites, for continued success.

3)  Shipping

	As expected, shipping on international projects takes a lot of
	effort and there are long lead times required to get equipment
	positioned as needed.  RAF & RSF staff, with the excellent
	support of NCAR Shipping and Receiving, pulled off another success.
	On future deployments it is recommended that ATD acquire an additional
	seatainer that would be equipped with a standard deployment package
	of support equipment.  The overall package would evolve over time
	based on needs for joint RSF/RAF support.  Items to be included
	would be tables, chairs, work stands, ladders, and other equipment
	needed to work on aircraft mounted instrumentation.

4)  Installation / Preparation

	The aircraft departed JeffCO on time and began research flights 
	on the specified date.  However, certain components of the 
	science package were not fully functional during the initial
	research flights.  Ongoing instrument development, problems with
	the installation of TCAS on the C-130, and a higher demand for
	User support during the installation period all contributed to
	this problem.  Some key concerns/recommendations are:

	a) Require better upfront information from the Users on their
	   instrumentation and integration support needs.  This would
	   also help us generate better cost/time  estimates for the shop.

	b) Avoid tying the development of key instruments to deployment 
	   deadlines.  Delays in the refurbishment of the MCR and the move
	   of SABL into a wing pod mount had a definite impact on the 
	   installation of the instrumentation package and test flight 
	   scheduling.

	c) Improve onboard research support infrastructure on the C-130.
	   Several key upgrade requirements were noted by PI's during the
	   deployment.  Such features as the intercom, serial data feed,
	   network capacity, display flexibility and storage space were
	   targeted.  RAF will hold a separate meeting to detail these
	   concerns, recommend specific solutions to the problems, and
	   prioritize actions.

	Despite the size and complexity of the combined ATD/User instrument
	package, the installation was considered safe and functional.

5)  Operations / Maintenance

	Operations and Maintenance provided excellent support in the field.
	Strong kudos were passed along from the PI's for the fast engine
	change that saved 2-3 research flight days in an already tight 
	schedule.  Some key support issues were raised that are linked
	to safety:  seats for all instrument operators, ground support
	staffing, access to proper work stands, in-cabin communications,
	and a visible alert mechanism for incoming SATCOM calls.  RAF will
	hold a separate meeting to detail these concerns,  recommend
	specific solutions to the problems, and prioritize actions.

        SATCOM from the aircraft to the ground was a valuable tool for the 
        PIs and contributed a great deal to the success of the project.
        We were not able to establish a voice of fax link from the ground ops
        to the aircraft. This did not seem to be a technical issue as much as
        a problem with the Maldivian phone system and the Honeywill Onelink
        service. Honeywell is aware of the problem. 

6)  Computer Support

	Ground support was good, as usual.  The increasing complexity of
	local network needs, including RSF and links to JOSS & scientists,
	are likely to add strain to the system.  The current practice of 
	allowing SA help to depart following the initial setup may need to
	be revisited.  Staffing could be spread across both RSF & RAF to 
	provide shared coverage for a longer period.  The move toward faster
	PC based systems was successful, but software needs remain incomplete.

	General User support at JeffCO, during preparation, could be improved
	with better notification and planning.  The increased demand for
	internet and telephone access can be accommodated with proper notice.

7)  General Instrumentation Issues

	On an instrument-by-instrument basis, the standard RAF systems
	performed very well.  We had our instrument failures, but adequate
	spares kept data loses to a minimum.  The absence of Darrel 
	Baumgardner during the preparation interval probably had an impact
	on some of the early difficulties we had with certain PMS probes.
	RAF needs a plan to improve PMS support in his absence.  We did have
	some difficulties with the new MCR and MASP configurations which
	need to be addressed before their next deployments.  A training 
	program and some sort of support policy needs to be established,
	as well.

        The RAF PMS PCASP probe was sent to PMS for an upgrade in preparation
        for the project and there was a 5 month turnaround resulting in the
        RAF having to borrow a NASA probe. Future projects should be aware of
        these long delays for PMS probe repairs and upgrades.
	
	RSF had some early problems with SABL, but at least one channel was
	working for most of the flights.  The system was fully functional
	by the end of the deployment.

8)  ADS / Onboard Display Issues

	The biggest problems we had with instrumentation were tied to the
	ADS system and onboard data recording and display.  Some data gaps
	are common on most flights, although they were typically short.
	On certain flights, a catestophic system failure brought down the
	entire system resulting in extended data gaps up to 30 minutes in
	duration.  Part of the problems can be tied to specific causes,
	some related to the infrastucture upgrades discussed in a previous
	topic.  However, enough uncertainty remains in the system performance
	to require additional and immediate attention.  RAF will hold a
	separate meeting to detail these concerns, recommend specific
	solutions to the problems, and prioritize actions.


9)  RSF Interface

	Interactions in the field were excellent.  Some improvement in
	coordinating logistical support is already under way, ala MAP.  
	Plans call for expanded resource sharing and staffing help,
	SA help in field, in particular.  A need is seen to establish
	(standardize) duty policies for all ATD staff participating
	in aircraft deployments.  RAF/RSF representatives will work out
	a new policy  for ground support responsibilities/limitations
	during field deployments (power & access).

10)  Rules of Engagement

	RAF/ATD policies and their application came under scrutiny during
	the project.  All are applied, but the "letter of the law" can
	vary due to specific project demands and staffing.  Communications
	between RAF and the PI's was not as good as it needed to be.  Often
	times the PI's would receive conflicting information from different
	sources.  This became particularly difficult when requests for 
	unplanned off site deployments were made.  ATD field support 
	practices and policies will be reviewed in the planned safety meeting
	noted above.  

11) A list for consideration:

    - Purchase seatainer, stock with deployments supplies

    - Provide color printer for field use

    - Improve reliability of ADS, IRIG time distribution

    - Determine problems with PMS interface boards. Replace or repair and
      have a sufficient inventory to support all probes and spares.

    - Provide inflight displays of MCR and SABL and AMIR at any workstation

    - Improve quality of intercom system. Have headsets for every position 

    - Fix ADS counter boards so that they are not noisy (spikes, glitches)

    - Upgrade CO instrument

    - Fix cockpit satcom handset. Equip with alert device so that cockpit 
      people will know when there is a incoming call.

Everyone:

About our recent talks regarding the PALT calculation:

There are two basic inputs to the PALT calculation using the NACA standard
atmosphere:  surface pressure & temperature.  Previously, surface pressure
could be changed via the Defaults file on a flt-by-flt basis, but temperature
was hard-wired in the code.  Chris has modified nimbus to place both
parameters in the Defaults file.  By changing the mean surface temperature
on the INDOEX flights from 288K to 300K we now get a much better comparison
between PALT & HGM232.  I don't see any reason to play with the continuity
equation to get a different relationship between pressure and altitude.

I also had Chris use HGM232 in the calculation of surface pressure (had been
tied to HGM only).  Unfortunately, this calculation does not use the new PALT,
so we get big and unrealistic swings in PSURF during altitude changes.  We
should consider whether or not to include this output in the final data set.

As you probably noted in looking at the data, the output of the RSTB's vary
significantly (up to 8 oC ) with altutude.  This is caused by the large
quantities of water vapor in the tropical atmosphere.  I have generated a
correction algorithm (empirically derived) that will provide a useful surface
temperature for the INDOEX flights.  Unfortunately, this correction will
be specific to the general conditions in the project area and should not be
used on other projects.  The correction process suggested by Dave Rogers was
just too complicated to bring on line in this time frame.  We still need to
evaluate his process for general use, in any case.

Allen and Chris,

I hope you included a default value in the amlib code for mean surface
temperature, so the PALT calculation is compatible with older projects
whose Defaults files won't have that constant.

Via today's noon mail pickup at Jeffco I will be sending you the following
thirteen (13) 8mm tapes for archiving to the SCD Mass Store System:
 
     R1310 to R1317 and R1345 to 1349

Please be aware that these tapes are for "read only."  Unlike ordinary audio,
video and DAT tapes, a black "hole" actually makes these tapes writeable.
Therefore, the red, write-enable flag will be in the exposed (ERASE OFF)
position.  Do NOT change the position of this flag.  If a tape seems to
be write enabled, contact me immediately.

Included in the blue bag will be one 1/2" round tape:

     G00083

It has a "filegard" ring installed to prevent a write ring from being used.
In my earlier phone conversation with Julie, I requested that this tape be
cleaned before I try to read it.
 
Please let me know when they are ready to read.
Thanks.  :)

Allen,

In /home/productiondata/102rf09.cdf and probably all the other
NIMBUS production output files, the following variables are undefined
(long_name = "No title" ; units = "Unk"):
     XDAFSTA
     XDAFSTB
     CONC2C_OBR
     CONC2P_IBR
     IAS

The present reference VarDB lists the following, and I'm not sure why
your names differ from these:
     CONC2C1_OBR
     CONC2P1_IBR
     IASX

If your names should be the standard, then I'll update the reference
VarDB file.  It looks like the other two are project-related and should
be entered into the project's VarDB file.

Greg,

The final production data for INDOEX are not yet available.

The flight-level data for this project is quite complex and requires merging
at least 4 data sources together to produce the final production data set.

Dick Friesen is working on RF01-RF08, and Allen Schanot is working on
RF09-RF18.  I suspect it will be a few weeks until we are ready to release
these data.  When they are available, they will be archived on the SCD Mass
Store System (MSS) as bitfiles in the directory /RAF/1999/102/.  The netCDF
bitfiles will be in the LRT subdirectory with a name of the form RFxx.cdf,
where "xx" refers to a flight number, possibly including a segment letter,
e.g., /RAF/1999/102/LRT/RF15B.cdf.

A log of all flights, including flight date, start and end times, file
size, etc., will be in the MSS bitfile:  /RAF/1999/102/LRT/taplog.102

I'll send you another email message when these data are available.

If you "can't wait" and want to work with preliminary data, you may contact
Allen or Dick.

Hi Ron:

By any chance, do you have an algorithm to compute cloud base temperature,
pressure and height from measurement of T, RH and P in the sub-cloud
region? I would like to define cloud base conditions for some periods
from INDOEX.

I suggest you just use ambient temperature, dew point and static pressure.
You're in luck, because the algorithm we use to calculate equivalent
potential temperature involves calculating TLCL first.  Following is
the C code used to do that.

    tlcl = (2840.0 / (3.5 * log((double)atx) - log((double)edpc) - 4.805))
                                + 55.0;
     where,   tlcl  = temperature at lifting condensation level (K)
               atx  = ambient temperature (K)
               edpc = vapor pressure (mbar)
               log  = natural logarithm function
             double = convert from single- to double-precision

We use the Goff-Gratch formula to calculate vapor pressure from the measured
dew point:
     edpc = pow(10.0, (
        -7.90298 * ((Ts / Tk) - 1.0)
        +5.02808 * log10(Ts / Tk)
        -1.3816e-7 * (pow(10.0, 11.334 * (1.0 - Tk / Ts)) - 1.0)
        +8.1328e-3 * (pow(10.0, -3.49149 * (Ts / Tk - 1.0)) - 1.0))
        +log10(1013.246) );
     where,     Ts = 373.16
                Tk = dew point temperature (K)
             log10 = log to base ten function
               pow = first argument to the power of the second argument

I had to dig to find PLCL.  It was in GENPRO.  Here is the code:
     PLCL = PSXC*(TLCL/ATXK)**3.5
     where, PLCL = pressure at lifting condensation level (mbar)
            PSXC = static pressure (mbar)
            ATXK = ambient temperature (K)
            **   = FORTRAN power operator

To calculate the height, I can offer you only the NACA pressure altitude
equation.  It isn't strictly correct, because it uses a standard atmosphere
and doesn't integrate the hydrostatic equation from a sounding.
     HLCL = 153.77 * SFCT * (1.0 - pow((double)PLCL / ASTG, 0.190284));
     where, HLCL = height of lifting condensation level (M)
            SFCT = mean surface temperature (K)  (Default = 288.15)
            ASTG = altimeter setting (mbar)  (Default = 1013.246)

Hope this helps you.

We've had a few inquiries regarding the availability of the 1-sec

the processing, but I thought I would come to the "knower of all

CODIAC or link it appropriately.

Hope all is going well and you are having a good summer. Thanks

We are now in the process of producing the production low-rate data for
INDOEX.  Dick Friesen told me that the highest priority flights are RF02
(02/18/1999), RF07 (02/28/1999), RF10 (03/09/1999) and RF13 (03/16/1999).
They will be archived and released before they are fully quality checked.
(I doubt we would be reprocessing the data; anomalies just won't be fully
documented by then.)  The forecast is that they will be ready by then end
of this week.  Once I have archived them, I'll give you the word, and you
can pick them up from the SCD Mass Store System.  Their bitfile names will
be of the form:  /RAF/1999/102/LRT/fltno, where fltno = RF02, RF07, RF10
or RF13.

As of now I don't have a target date for release of the full production data
set.

Summer is going well, but I been too busy to relax and enjoy it yet;
maybe soon.

Ron

Steve,

I guess that's OK with me.  I may forward messages to Bruce,
since I was not in the loop for the EEZ tape.

Ron,
Thanks for the update. Keep me posted. I think we'll wait till
the full production of low-rate data are ready before we load
them to CODIAC. However, if someone needs the selected flights
I'll send them to the Mass Store.

Thanks for your help. I did hear back from India regarding the
EEZ data tape that Bruce Morely (or you) prepared from them.
They had some difficulty dealing with the NetCDF format and
I pointed them to the UNIDATA WWW page for some software. I
think they were expecting ASCII on a diskette! In any event,
if it's OK I'll point them in your general direction for any
further questions.

Hi Ron:

The INDOEX CVI data (processed ascii and netcdf converted) is in
/home/tmp/cindy/indoex; the processing program is in the src subdirectory.
Let me know what other information you need.

Hi back to you, Cindy,

Thanks for the info.  Would it be OK to move those files into the INDOEX
Production subdirectory, or would you rather I copy them there?

Cindy,

Because of UNIX permissions, I couldn't move the files.
Therefore, I copied them.  They now exist in the directory
/home/local/proj/102/Production/CVI.

If you get a chance, you may remove them from
/home/tmp/cindy/indoex or wait for the scrubber to do it.

Thanks for sending them!

Ron

Allen,

You have a choice of just the ADS data or the tape images.  The tape
images are split into pieces.

You can use the "msgetads" script to retrieve what you want.  The .ADS
extent files have the stripped ADS data.  The ones with tape numbers are
the tape images.

Olga:
  Sorry for the slow response. We have been "ready" to release the final data
set for several weeks, but we keep finding adjustments that we need to make
to some of the PMS probes to accommodate for the lack of valid housekeeping
info. Allen is finishing flights 17 and 18 and will put these on an area of
disk on our server that outside users can access. These will be there 
tomorrow, Thursday. 
  Contact Ron Ruth, the RAF Data Manager to find out how to access these files
and download them. These will be the entire dataset for the whole flight and
will be in net-CDF format. Our documentation describing any limitations or
anomolies with the data set be sent out later and put on-line.
  This data set will not contain CO, MASP, MCR, or SABL data.
  Questions regarding access, email Ron Ruth, (ruth@ucar.edu, 303-497-1084).
  Questions regarding data quality issues email allen or me.

regards,
Dick

As we discussed, the INDOEX lrt files are ready but the documentation is not.
I would like you to put the files where the outside PIs can access them and
send a email to INDOEX distribution telling people how to access these file.
You should mention that these are being made available before the documentation
is complete to expedite there access to the data. I will give you a list of
people to send the message to.

Dear Everybody:

Cindy Twohy and I have agreed on the "indirect  effect"  priority
C130 cases for the INDOEX group to work on for the Utrecht meeting,
and we would like your feedback. We rated each  flight  according
to  how  well  it  can be used to address the indirect effect. We
felt that CN, CCN, and aerosol composition data in  the  subcloud
environment  as  well  as  in-cloud measurements could be used to
establish a linkage in the physical processes which gives rise to
the  indirect  (Twomey)  effect.  We therefore rated highly those
cases which contained measurements  both  in-and  below-cloud  at
times which were relatively close. For the gradient flights, good
radiation measurements  (usually  on  the  return  leg)  were  of
importance  as  they  provide  a means of inferring the radiative
consequences of the indirect effect.

We gave high values to those gradient flights  (a  perfect  score
was assigned a value of 10) that contained sub-cloud and in-cloud
data throughout much of the duration of the N-S transit, and  had
radiation  measurements  on  the  return leg; two of the gradient
flights had scores of 10. The  flight  of  24  March,  while  not
highly  rated as a gradient flight, scores high marks for getting
clean cloud closure. While we gave marks of 7 or 8 to several  of
the  non-gradient  flights,  we recommend focusing on 21 March, 7
March followed by 27 Feb and 16 March for the  "polluted" clouds.
Note  that on several of  these days, there are discrete times of
interest. Also note that there were  several non-gradient flights
whose ratings of "nix" mean that they are of little  interest.

Please let us know what you think of these ratings and to  pursue
the  recommended  cases for discussion at the Utrecht meeting. We
would especially like to receive input from Valero's group as  to
the  quality  of  the  radiation  data  for the desirable periods
below.

Please refer to the attached word document for a detailed summary that
Cindy put together for the non-gradient flights and below that I
put together for all of the flights. For anyone who would like a
copy, we have put together a plot which shows the C130 altitude
and latitude as a function of time, where we have indicated the times
when cloud  was penetrated.

                        MORE DETAIL

16 Feb: Not much cloud, shake-down flight

18 Feb: Not much cloud

20  Feb:  Very  good  gradient  flight  from  5N  TO   7S,   good
measurements  sub-cloud  throughout  track  from N to S, good in-
cloud measurements throughout  from  N  to  S,   good  radiometer
measurements, GOOD, GRADIENT FLIGHT.

24  Feb:  Very  good  gradient  flight  from  5N  to   8S,   good
measurements  sub-cloud  throughout  track  from N to S, good in-
cloud measurement from N  to  S,  good  radiometer  measurements,
GOOD, GRADIENT FLIGHT.

25 Feb: Very little in-cloud time, in-cloud measurements  do  not
coincide with subcloud measurements.

27  Feb:  Nice  period  of  in-cloud  measurement  straddled   by
measurements  in  the  subcloud  environment,  0700-0815  on  our
timescale at lat approx  8N,  good  boundary-layer  cloud  period
about  9:50  to  10:20  at  7N.           28 Feb: Brief period of
subcloud msts followed by in-cloud from 0700-0810 our time  scale
at lat of 2N, but other periods have higher tops and possibly out
of boundary layer.

4 March: Gradient flight, relatively long  in-cloud  penetrations
but  only  brief  period in the boundary layer (near 04:30). Good
radiation. OKAY GRADIENT BUT NOT GOOD FOR SUB-CLOUD.

7 March: Relatively good period of subcloud measurements followed
by   incloud  easurements  from  0750  to  0900,  again  in-cloud
0915-1000 but not associated subcloud measurements.  Measurements
near 11N. good, for the above periods.

9 March: Essentially no in-cloud times.

11 March: Gradient flight from 5N to 7S with very  good  in-cloud
data  from  -2 to -7N Only brief period sub-cloud just before in-
cloud times,  thus  good  characterization  only  near  3S.  Good
Radiation? GOOD but not great GRADIENT.

13 March: Flight at 8N, but some good periods  near  0500,  0800,
0900  to  1000 where sub-cloud followed by in-cloud. Coordination
with Dutch Citation makes this a compelling case.  However,  CCNC
was not working
  well on this case.

16 March: Clouds  from  0300-0400,  but  no  associated  subcloud
measurements.   Possibly  good  polluted  clouds  from  5 to 10N.
TROUBLE IS THAT THERE  WERE  NO  SUB-CLOUD  MEASUREMENTS  IN  AND
AROUND IN-CLOUD SAMPLING.

18 March: Cb at different  levels.  Good  subcloud  measurements.
GOOD TO STUDY TRANSPORT OF LOW-LEVEL POLLUTANTS UP HIGH.

19 March:  Brief  period  near  0600  to  0700  where  low  level
measurements  followed  by  in-cloud at lat of 10N. GOOD BUT VERY
BRIEF PERIOD FOR DIRTY CLOUDS

21 March: Good period of  subcloud  measurements  after  in-cloud
flight  at 0745 to 0815 at 10N. PROBABLY GOOD DIRTY CLOUD PERIOD,
BUT RELATIVELY SHORT IN-CLOUD SAMPLING.

24 March: Gradient flight from 5N to 7S,  but  relatively  little
in-cloud  time, and almost none in dirty air.  Almost   all cloud
at 7S. However, good sub-cloud period in clean air, near  to  the
cloud sampling, thus good for process study. GRADIENT FLIGHT, BUT
VIRTUALLY NO MEASUREMENTS IN DIRTY AIR, RELATIVELY  LOW  IN-CLOUD
SAMPLING.  It  is a case with a very good characterization of the
clean clouds.

25 March: Some cloud sampling from 0800 to 1000 at 4 to 7 N,  one
episode  where  subcloud  followed  by  in-cloud penetration, but
otherwise little low-level in-cloud linkages.

Hello all again;

It has been pointed out that I did not include dates for the C-130
flights in yesterdays e-mail.
Here they are.  Also the times given were in GMT time as recorded on the
C-130 data system.

Flight 2  -  February 18
Flight 7  -  February 28
Flight 10  - March 9
Flight 13-   March 16

Allen and Dick,

Perusing INDOEX RF01, I found the following variables had no definitions
from the project's VarDB file, and hence, had 'long_name = "No title"' and
'units = "Unk"' in the netCDF header of the production output netCDF file.
(I assume that all production output netCDF files suffer the same fate.)
     XDAFSTA
     XDAFSTB
     CONC2C_OBR
     CONC2P_IBR
     DIFF1
     IAS
     PVOLM_NA
     CVINFLAG
Should these be fixed before we release the data (or at all)?

Ron:
  I do not know if the files can be edited (the headers) to change this. If
not I agree with Allen, no reruns. We will note this in the qc.

Ron:

	XDAFSTA & XDAFSTB are User variables.  Update with (Vdc).

	CONC2C & CONC2P should be updated (N/L).

	DIFF1 & PVOLM & DISPF aren't supposed to be there and only
	exists in rf01 - rf03.  I will remove them.

	IAS is something Chris added.  Update with (m/sec).

	CVINFLAG is a status indecator for Cindy.  Update with (Vdc).

	I will NOT rerun all of the flights to correct.  If that is
	required, all can go as UNK's.

Steve:
  I would like to know a little more about how this is going to work for 
INDOEX. Are you (JOSS) going to be the central archive and distributor for
these data sets after they are delivered to you? What format are you expecting
them in? Please clarify what role you are fulfilling. Typically we would send
these data to the primary PI, Clarke, and to several other primary PIs who 
request it (Ramanathan, Ogren, Coakley, etc.). I refer to the aircraft data 
that the RAF is responsible for.
  Regarding the list:
   PMS FSSP 100, 300, PCASP and PVM-100 are all part of the C-130 data set and
   will be included in the one second net-CDF file.
   The MASP is Baumgardner's responsibility(as noted)and is a separate data set.
   The CVI is Twohy`s as noted, however her data has been merged into the 
    C-130 net-CDF files.
   The slow ozone is Campos's repsonsibility and has been merged into the 
    C-130 net-CDF files. The CO is a separate data set. 
   The project was requested as a low-rate (1-sec) data set. We will do high
    rate processing upon request. We encourge PIs to look over the low rate
    data first and decide which flights they would like high rate processing 
    for if any.
   The 2-D data files are not in net-CDF format. They have been stripped and
    put into separate files and archived on the mass store in raw format. PIs
    are welcome to access them. Contact Ron Ruth if you want a pointer to them.
   The video tapes are at Jeffco. We do not make copies. We will turn the 
    originals over to whomever is ready to assume the responsibility of 
    archiving and keeping track of them. (JOSS?, Scripps?, Clarke?).

Give me a call if you have questions. We are finished with the primary 
processing. We have released the data to some eager people without 
which we are currently working on. If you want to start bringing these net-CDF
files over, contact Ron Ruth.

Ron,
Congratulations on getting the C-130 data ready so soon! We may put a
selected subset on-line via CODIAC like we did for ACE-1 with links
to the entire data set on the Masstore. Also, please send me a
digital copy of the project documentation when ready.

We will be handling the data management for INDOEX in a similar fashion
to ACE-1, so one of these days I may drop you a visit to pick your
brain and discuss some ideas of linking or transfer to other RAF data 
sets like the 2-D files.

Thanks for your help.

Steve

Dear Ron,


I coudl not find the flight level data at

Is the path correct?

BTW, are these the raw files converted in the field, or are they the qt
files?

Thank you for your help,

I'm sorry.  It is correct in the second part of my email message.
The correct ftp path for these data is:
     pub/tmp/indoex/

Pat Sheridan [(303)497-6672, psheridan@cmdl.noaa.gov] called me a bit ago
wondering why an ADS serial feed of John Ogren's measurements never made
it to the production output files.  Apparently he has some missing data
from his own data collection and thought he could fill in the values from
our data.  He asked for the possiblity of us creating separate files with
the 5 measurements that interest him.

I looked at the ADS header (using "hdrdump"), and there is a 20-byte
block labeled AEROSOL, but I don't know if it is Ogren's.

I told Pat that one of you would contact him regarding this request.

Pat:
   Our recollection is that we contacted the PIs who were having data recorded
on our data system to see if they wanted it included in the final data set.
My understanding is that Orgen's desire was to not include the five variables
because they needed correction and he did not want to put it out in the raw
form.
   It will be a big job to pull your data block off from all 18 flights. If
you have some time periods for which you would like us to create a few 
separate files we can try and oblige, otherwise, we do not have the time right
now to run all 18 flights and create files.
   So, give us the times and flights for which you would like data. We will 
look it over and get back to you.

Thanks Dick.  I understand your time contraints.  I will supply the few
times (I would guess 3 or 4, but that's only a guess) where our data system
was not logging data properly, but where we should have been exporting data
to the C130 data system.  I will try to do that soon, perhaps early next
week.

Thanks again.

Allen,

I'll use only final versions of the files before converting them for the
web, and I'll make sure that both you and Dick review and approve the site
before I release it on line.

Everyone,

     A reminder that caddis will be needed for the MAP field program and
therefore we must look for another place to store the data files there
(currently about 10Gb worth).  I will ask around in ATD and also do some
checking at the RAF.  Does anyone know if we will need substantially more than
the current 10Gb?  Allen may know in better detail, but I'm guessing caddis
won't be available in another week or two.  Allen?

Mike,

I'm not sure if there are other reasons for keeping the INDOEX data around,
but the production processing for INDOEX is complete and now in Quality
Assurance.  The productiondata are in the /home/productiondata directory and
not on caddis.  If we need to do spot reprocessing, I'm sure /home/data should
work out.  If people want to handle MCR or other large sections of the data,
then we'll need to find space for those large files.

That's my perspective.

Ron

Dear Ron:

Hello! Hope everything is alright. Thank you for making the C130 data
accessible for INDOEX C130 participants! Unfortunately, I'm having trouble
in trying to get it. I just can't find those files in the pub/genpro
directory. Please, can you give me some more details on how to access this
data?

Thank you very much!

Best regards,

Olga

Hi Ron:

Can you pls confirm that the INDOEX CVI files (*.NEW, *.cdf, and source
files) are backed up? The reason I ask is my computer died, and I have to
reinstall NT. My original versions will be wiped out, but there are copies
in /home/tmp/cindy/indoex and wherever you put them.

Thanks
Cindy

Cindy,

I have made a copy of all the files in your /home/tmp/cindy/indoex directory.
(They are still there, too.)

Good luck restoring NT.  Have you upgraded to Service Pack 5 yet?

Ron

Here is what I'm planning to add to the extant README file in the directory
where all the production netCDF files for INDOEX lie:
  ftp/pub/tmp/indoex
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=   cut here   =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

          ***    NOTE regarding FSSP measurements    ***

Analysis by Dr. Darrel Baumgardner, RAF's PMS expert, has shown that the
derived FSSP calculations for the production data files in this directory
need to be revised.  Once this is done, the derived measurements of liquid
water content (LWC) will be higher than the current production data by
anywhere from 12% to 40% depending on the measured LWC.  Lower LWCs have the
greatest increase (based on a sampling of values between 0.1 and 1.3 g/M3).

          ***                                        ***

Do you think this is OK?

Let me know what you think:


                            INDOEX C-130 DATA PROCESSING

    This notice is to inform you that the NCAR C-130 data set previously 
released (email of 3 August, 1999) contains PMS FSSP-100 that has some 
discrepancies. Users of the data are cautioned that there will be a future
re-release of the data that will supercede the first. ALL DATA EXCEPT FOR
THE FSSP-100 WILL MOST LIKELY REMAIN UNCHANGED. 
    There are some remaining issues regarding the use of FSSP-100 housekeeping 
data in processing that need to be resolved. We are confident that these will
be resolved very soon and the revised data set along with the data quality
report can be released.
    In the meantime, please use the FSSP data with caution. Indications are 
that liquid water content values calculated from the FSSP-100 will change on
the order of 12 -> 40% larger depending on the liquid water present. This is
primarily due to changes in the values of FSSP cell widths based upon 
calibrations.
    If you have questions at time please contact Darrel Baumgardner, or the
RAF Data Manager, Ron Ruth regarding release of the revised data set. We 
apologise for any inconvenience this has caused. Documentation for the entire
data set will be available in the future on an RAF web site.

                       INDOEX C-130 DATA PROCESSING

   I am sending this notice to inform you that the NCAR EC-130Q data, released
on 3 August 1999, contain PMS FSSP-100 data that have some discrepancies.
(See my email, Subject: NCAR EC-130Q Flight-Level Data Available.)  Users
of these data are cautioned that there will be a future re-release that
will supersede those now present.

 *** ALL DATA, EXCEPT FOR THE FSSP-100, MOST LIKELY WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED. ***

   There are some remaining issues to be resolved regarding the use of
FSSP-100 housekeeping data in the processing.  RAF is confident that these
will be resolved promptly, and we soon can release the revised data set
along with the Data Quality Report.
   In the meantime, please use the FSSP-100 data with caution.  Indications
are that the revised concentration values from the FSSP-100 will change, and
the calculated liquid water content values may change on the order of 12 to
40% depending on the amount of liquid water present.  This is primarily due
to changes in the values of FSSP-100 cell widths based upon calibrations.
   If you have questions at this time, please contact Darrel Baumgardner

                       INDOEX C-130 DATA PROCESSING

   I am sending this notice to inform you that the NCAR EC-130Q data, released
on 3 August 1999, contain PMS FSSP-100 data that have some discrepancies.
(See my email, Subject: NCAR EC-130Q Flight-Level Data Available.)  Users
of these data are cautioned that there will be a future re-release that
will supersede those now present.

 *** ALL DATA, EXCEPT FOR THE FSSP-100, MOST LIKELY WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED. ***

   There are some remaining issues to be resolved regarding the use of
FSSP-100 housekeeping data in the processing.  RAF is confident that these
will be resolved promptly, and we soon can release the revised data set
along with the Data Quality Report.
   In the meantime, please use the FSSP-100 data with caution.  Indications
are that the revised concentration values from the FSSP-100 will change, and
the calculated liquid water content values may change on the order of 12 to
40% depending on the amount of liquid water present.  This is primarily due
to changes in the values of FSSP-100 cell widths based upon calibrations.
   If you have questions at this time, please contact Darrel Baumgardner
<darrel@ucar.edu>, or me regarding release of the revised data set.
   We apologise for any inconvenience this has caused.  Documentation for
the entire data set will be available in the future on the RAF web site.

Dick & Allen,

I thought I'd let you know that both emails I have sent to the INDOEX
participants had the email address <j.lilieveld@fys.ruu.nl> returned
to me with a "User unknown" message.  If either of you know a correct

Dear Dr. Friesen,

I am working with Leo Donner to define some cases from INDOEX for a
limited area mesoscale simulation. We like to place the integration
domain as close as possible to the in situ measurements (for
initialization and comparison purposes). I would be grateful if you can
provide us with a list of C-130 flights (time, position) during Feb-Mar,
1999, or if you can indicate where such information is available. Thank
you.


Sincerely, 

Constantin Andronache

Darrel:
   I hate to be a nag, BUT we need to get on with the final INDOEX reprocessing
and we are waiting on the algorithm for the FSSP-100 concentrations. At least
I think we are. My understanding is that with the lack of housekeeping we 
would usually set the activity to zero. Since this is a measure of coincident
particles it obviously is a function of concentration, so you have an algorithm
to correct the concentration based on concentration. This will result in a 
higher final concentration. If I have this right I can see where it can get
tricky because if you adjust the concentration it will also effect the liquid
water content. It seems that this means that we will not only have to increase
the total concentration but also decide how this increased concentration is
distributed across the bins. It may be best to go with the new bin sizes and
DOF that you have already given us which results in a higher LWC but not mess
with the concentration and use conntants for the missing housekeeping (ie,
acitivity = 0). Please advise. We would like to get started on reprocessing
next Monday.
   If we do process without the correction algorithm, then we would advise 
people of the resulting lower concentration in the documentation.

Ron,

Included below is a section of an email message I just received from Jim
Coakley at OSU.  He's one of the INDOEX PIs.  Apparently, Jim would now like to
receive all of the raw MCR data from INDOEX.

I am going to be on vacation all of next week (until 25 September), and after I
return, I'll be getting ready to leave for Innsbruck and MAP.  Hence, it would
be helpful to me if you would handle getting the raw MCR data files prepared
and sent off to Jim at OSU.  I'll email Jim to let him know that you will be
filling his request.

Thanks, in advance, for your help on this.

Krista

Jim,

I will be out of the office on vacation from 18-25 September.  After I return,
I will be spending most of my time wrapping up several other projects in
preparation for leaving for Austria on 13 October to manage the second half of
the Electra deployment for MAP.  Thus, I have forwarded on your request to
obtain all of the raw MCR data to Ron Ruth, the RAF data manager.  I have asked
Ron to handle filling this data request.  Thus, should you have any questions
regarding your request for MCR data, please contact Ron directly at
ruth@ucar.edu or by phone at 303-497-1084.  Also, for future reference, all
requests for project data obtained from NCAR/NSF aircraft should be submitted
directly to Ron.

In regard to using Rick's and Teresa's equipment to obtain ambient calibrations
for the MCR, I will need to find out more details from them regarding the
specifications of their existing calibration equipment and whether or not their
equipment will be compatible with the MCR.  It is an interesting idea; however,
given my own schedule for the next several weeks, any exploration of this will
likely have to wait until I return from Austria in late November.  Also, I note
that we (the RAF) already own a small calibration sphere for use in calibrating
the MCR at ambient conditions.  This is the same sphere we had with us in the
field for INDOEX.  While this sphere was damaged in transit to the Maldives, it
has now been repaired and we hope to be able to use it for future calibration
checks of the MCR.

Regards,

Krista

Jim,

Krista forwarded your MCR data request to me.  We can provide these data to
you as stripped binary files.  (The MCR data were separated from the other
measurements in the data stream and archived separately.)  Twenty-eight of
them are just over 1GB in size while the remainder have sizes less than that.
Generally, there are 3 files per flight totalling 38.738GB, a rather large
amount of data.  (A full list of files appears below; no time data are
available for each of these files.)  It would be easiest for us to send them
to you as sequential, raw, binary files (record size 32k bytes, NOT in tar
format) on 8mm (Exabyte) tape (high or low density--please specify), but other
media are available (DAT or DLT).  If you choose media other than 8mm tape,
it will take more time for us to assemble all the files.  (In any case I
estimate it will take 2-3 weeks for us to get all the data ready for you.)

You can get information regarding the flight dates and time periods
(including standard flight-level data files) from our web site:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/data_catalog.html  (Project Data Catalog)
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/l_taplog/taplog.102  (INDOEX data file log)

I look forward to hearing from you.

Ron

  Ask Darrel what DOF he wants to use for INDOEX FSSP-100 processing. Does
he want to use one value for all flights? Different values for different
groups of flights? If the latter, tell us specifically what values for which
flights. For flights 1-3 we are using the left FSSP and for 4-18 we are using
the right FSSP, so DOFs for these probes are what we are after. I am not  
as concerned about the left probe after 3. We are only putting out one FSSP
in the production.

Ron, 

...to follow up on our phone conversation... what I would like to 
see are files for each flight, or portion of flight, for 
each MCR channel as Krista was preparing for us.  These are 
instrument bit streams of 1-sec records, each record 
containing 7 two-byte integers that contain the time and 
header information followed by 5000 two-byte integers that
contain the instrument counts.  To facilitate our data management, 
it would probably help to have the data broken into 
one or two hour flight segments, making four to eight segments 
per flight.  There are 1 - 7 channels of data for each 
segment, depending on the health of the instrument for the 
particular flight segment.

Jim,

Ron Ruth just told me that you had called him to discuss your request
for MCR data.  First off, I must admit to a "whoops" on my part.  In my
haste to respond to your request, I completely forgot that the files I
created for you had been massaged slightly from the basic raw format and
had been output as individual files for each channel.  My apologies for
that lapse on my part.

Ron and I just spoke about this matter at some length, and I would like
to propose the following plan of attack to you.  Ron may have already
explained this to you on the phone, but due to staffing constraints here
at the RAF and also because of disk space limitations, it will be an
extremely drawn-out process for us to process all of the raw MCR data
into the format you have been using (i.e., separate file for each
channel).  Since you now wish to obtain all of the MCR data for each
research flights, Chris' script will generate very large files for each
channel, for each flight.  It would take either Ron or I a significant
period of time (given my travel schedule and work load and Ron's work
load) to create all of these files for you.

Thus, I would like to propose a solution which might allow you to obtain
the files you desire in a shorter period of time.  I would like to make
available to you the binary of the script program ("mcr_cut") that
creates the files you have been using.  This script is setup to run on
Sun UNIX machines and should therefore run on your system at OSU.  The
program requires the following as input:  the name of the raw input
file, the channel numbers to output, and the start and stop times to be
output.  Ron can provide you with the start and stop times for the
various raw MCR data files, and he can also download for you all of the
raw MCR data files from the NCAR Mass Store System (MSS).

I have placed a copy of "mcr_cut" in a public ftp directory here on our
system.  To obtain this file, do the following:

1)  ftp raf.atd.ucar.edu
2)  log on as anonymous and enter your full email address as the
password
3)  cd pub/tmp/sheba
4)  enter "bi" to switch to binary transfer mode
5)  enter "get mcr_cut" to retrieve the file

Let me know if the above-proposed plan is acceptable.  If so, I will ask
Ron to go ahead and start preparing the raw MCR data files for you.

Krista

Darrel,

I just wanted to summarize our final processing plans for the FSSP-100 data
during INDOEX and see if it is what you would expect.

Changes were made to the production NIMBUS setup to implement the lack of
 housekeeping:
  1) Allen set the dependencies for the FSSP concentration calculation
      as follows:
        activity = 0.
           fbmfr = 1.
  2)  In the PMSspecs file:
       FSSP109 = AFSSP_LPI (RF01 - RF03)
        DOF (Post Cal DOF = 1.75*0.6) = 1.0
        BEAM_DIAM = 0.19
       FSSP122 = AFSSP_RPC (RF04 - RF18)
        DOF (Mid point Cal DOF = 2.59*0.6) = 1.55
        BEAM_DIAM = 0.19

The pertinent NIMBUS equations follow (amlib file is fssp.c):
  sa[probeNum] = DOF * beamDiameter;
  vol[probeNum] = tas * sa[probeNum] * fbmfr * (1.0 - (activity * 0.71));
With the changed dependencies, this equation would simplify to:
  vol[probeNum] = tas * sa[probeNum]
  sampleVolume[i] = vol[probeNum];
  concentration[i]  = conc = actual[i] / sampleVolume[i];

The basic nimbus code is the same except for one change:  Chris added two
 lines that implement the simplified version of your correction for lack
 of housekeeping:

  if (strncmp(&(varp->name[1]), "FSSP", 4) == 0)
    concentration[i] = concentration[i] / (1.0 - 6.0e-4*concentration[i]);

(Chris did not implement a more rigorous version that would have involved
all the equations in your email attachment.)

We still have questions regarding which DOF should be used for each probe?
For RF01 - RF03, we are using the left FSSP, and for RF04-RF18 we are using
the right FSSP.  (Only one FSSP-100 probe output appears in the production
data set.)  Is there a separate value for each probe, and does it change for
each flight, for a group of flights or remain constant for all flights?  Also
what specific value(s) should we be using?  I need this information very soon,
since Dick leaves for MAP at week's end, and I want to have every thing set
up to do the processing by then.

Krista,

Oh boy....  Just what I wanted....

I'd be surprised if the resources available to me here come anywhere
near those available there at RAF.  Here, I'm working with a 
parttime student worker who is working only parttime on the MCR.
Likewise, as you know, the INDOEX MCR work is only one of a dozen projects
that I'm currently responsible for....  So, it's not even clear that
person-wise, I have resources here that 
go beyond what are available to RAF.  Also, using a piece of 
executable code is not likely to lead to success.  One invariably 
runs into calls to devices that are site specific making such a program
useless.  Nevertheless, I suppose we ought to give it a try 
to see what sort of project we're getting ourselves into.  

I propose a trial run.  I suggest that Ron set aside a raw file for
us--a relatively small file.  We'll ftp the file here and try, using the 
executable code, to process it.  

Jim

Julie:
  The "original" production processed are on the RAF ftp directory. We (Ron) 
put them there for INDOEX investigators to access. The data are going to be
reprocessed (sound familiar) within the next couple of weeks and these files
will be replaced with version 2. The problem with the data that are out there 
now is with the FSSP 100 and possibly the PMS hot wire liquid water values.
Everything else should remain unchanged. However, I would recommend that Liu
wait until the version 2 is released. The data can then be accessed via ftp.
(These are the netCDF files and they are ~50 - 70 MB.) As far as I know Liu
will not need an account on our system to do this, but will need to find out
the proceedure from Ron. I assume that since NSF is financing this effort Liu
does not need permission from the PI(s) Clarke or Ramanathan to access the 
data, but it might be a good idea for Liu to email them about what he is 
doing.

Dear Dr. Ron Ruth:

I and Judy Curry in CU are funded by NSF for retrieving Cloud liquid water
path from AIMR data for INDOEX project. I have already had all AIMR data
from Craig Walther. To conduct the retrieval, I need all the other data to
figure out the air temperature, sst, height of clouds, etc. I heard that
all the netcdf data are on raf computer and ready for indoex PIs to ftp.
(and a newer version is coming). Can you let me know how to do the ftp
(directory, any password, etc ...)? Also, can you send me an email after
the newer version becomes available?
Thank you very much.

Darrel, Ron: 
   On the INDOEX production data files there is no correction applied to 
either PMS hot wire for the calibration dispcrepancey that Krista found in
the wind tunnel. If I understand the calibration data that Krista supplied
correctly the correction should be applied to PLWCC and this is the one that
Darrel says is 15% low from his QA analysis. 
   So should we apply a correction factor to PLWCC and if so what?

Ron,
I recommend using the DOF = 2.81 mm and Beam Diameter = .19 mm for both LPI
and RPC FSSP's during all the project. The other code changes that you have
listed below are correct.

Subject: FSSP-100 processing for INDOEX


Darrel,

I just wanted to summarize our final processing plans for the FSSP-100 data
during INDOEX and see if it is what you would expect.

Changes were made to the production NIMBUS setup to implement the lack of
 housekeeping:
  1) Allen set the dependencies for the FSSP concentration calculation
      as follows:
        activity = 0.
           fbmfr = 1.
  2)  In the PMSspecs file:
       FSSP109 = AFSSP_LPI (RF01 - RF03)
        DOF (Post Cal DOF = 1.75*0.6) = 1.0
        BEAM_DIAM = 0.19
       FSSP122 = AFSSP_RPC (RF04 - RF18)
        DOF (Mid point Cal DOF = 2.59*0.6) = 1.55
        BEAM_DIAM = 0.19

The pertinent NIMBUS equations follow (amlib file is fssp.c):
  sa[probeNum] = DOF * beamDiameter;
  vol[probeNum] = tas * sa[probeNum] * fbmfr * (1.0 - (activity * 0.71));
With the changed dependencies, this equation would simplify to:
  vol[probeNum] = tas * sa[probeNum]
  sampleVolume[i] = vol[probeNum];
  concentration[i]  = conc = actual[i] / sampleVolume[i];

The basic nimbus code is the same except for one change:  Chris added two
 lines that implement the simplified version of your correction for lack
 of housekeeping:

  if (strncmp(&(varp->name[1]), "FSSP", 4) == 0)
    concentration[i] = concentration[i] / (1.0 - 6.0e-4*concentration[i]);

(Chris did not implement a more rigorous version that would have involved
all the equations in your email attachment.)

We still have questions regarding which DOF should be used for each probe?
For RF01 - RF03, we are using the left FSSP, and for RF04-RF18 we are using
the right FSSP.  (Only one FSSP-100 probe output appears in the production
data set.)  Is there a separate value for each probe, and does it change for
each flight, for a group of flights or remain constant for all flights?
Also
what specific value(s) should we be using?  I need this information very
soon,
since Dick leaves for MAP at week's end, and I want to have every thing set
up to do the processing by then.

Jim,

Yes, we're going to try a test run.  I was at a workshop all day yesterday
(9/16) so couldn't get the MCR data ready.  I'll pull down a file from the
Mass Store this morning and will let you know when things are ready to go.

If you haven't already done so, could you go ahead and grab the script
(mcr_cut) from the ftp directory I emailed you about?  Thanks.

Krista

Krista,

I have mcr_cut and at least at this preliminary stage, it shows signs of 
working on our newer spark stations.

I await a data file to try it on.

Jim,

I've placed a raw MCR data file in a public ftp directory here on our
system.  The file is called "102rf08c.mcr."  To retrieve this file, use
the same ftp directions I emailed you previously (log on as anonymous,
etc.), and change to the directory pub/tmp/sheba.  Switch to binary
transfer mode and then "get" the file.  The file is about 210 Mbytes in
size, so don't be surprised if the transfer takes a little while.

Let me know if the script works with this file.

Krista

All:
   Darrel's analysis for all of the INDOEX data for the PMS liquid water probes
shows that there is a difference between the probes of 15%-20%. Darrel's 
analysis was done on the production data that is current. No corrections have
been applied to account for the differences that Krista found in the wind
tunnel in Ottawa. Krista and I have reviewed the data available on serial
numbers and location of the probes for INDOEX. If the correction is applied
it will make the difference between the probes greater. Therefore for INDOEX
the correction will not be applied and the PMS liquid water data will remain
as is. 
   The most plausible explanation for the difference in the probes in INDOEX
consistent with the wind tunnel data is that the control boxes have been 
interchanged between these two events. Apparently the inconsistency will have
to remain a mystery, but there may be other explanations. It seems the lesson
to be learned here is that we should carefully record the serial numbers of
the probes, the boxes and the location of each and double check them before and
after a project and during the project if they are removed.
   Krista's report on the wind tunnel tests points out that the difference in
the wind tunnel data for the probes which were mounted side by side was 
traced to different gains in the control box circuitry. Dave Macfarland 
apparently has committed to making the boxes the same in gain before they are
both flown on the C-130 again.

Krista,

Boy, I can see what you mean by laborious....  I've been playing with 
mcr_cut and the data file....one has to play....I see...  But, 
looks like we can use it.

So, please have Ron copy the data as he suggested (32 kbyte records) to
8 mm 8500 exabytes.

Bruce,

The raw ADS data for the INDOEX FF01-FF11 flights have been archived to the
SCD Mass Store System, but no one has processed any of them.  To my knowledge
there are no plans to do so at this time.  You may want to check with Dick
Friesen and Allen Schanot to see if there have been any other requests.

Dick,
One of the items which came up at the INDOEX meeting in Utrecht was the
desire from the U of Innsbruck group and others to get the C130 data from
the ferry flights because they were on-board and operational.  I believe
that they are mostly looking for positional data.  Could you process these
files and make that information available as part of the INDOEX dataset?
Thanks.

Bruce,

The raw ADS data for the INDOEX FF01-FF11 flights have been archived to the
SCD Mass Store System, but no one has processed any of them.  To my
knowledge
there are no plans to do so at this time.  You may want to check with Dick
Friesen and Allen Schanot to see if there have been any other requests.

Darrel,

I have reprocessed the INDOEX FSSP data according to our latest agreements
and produced files in /home/productiondata of the form:  102rfxxFSSP.cdf
where "xx" is the flight number.

I thought you may want to review them.  I have yet to merge them into
the other production INDOEX data files which also can be found there
with their standard naming convention:  102rfxx.cdf
where "xx" is the flight number.  You can use these for comparison.

Ron,

OK.

Since I won't be back in Corvallis until Monday, there's no hurry.
If copying the rest of the files was going to take you several weeks,
it probably would have been prudent to let me work with a test tape 
before you proceeded.  In any case, I'm sure we'll get the programs
for working with the data going at OSU.  So, looking forward to 
getting the tapes next week.

Jim

Ron,
I've done a comparison between FSSP parameters before and after the
new processing on flight 13 and as far as I can see with this flight,
the data look reasonable. As expected, with the higher DOF, the
concentrations are smaller, but with the liquid water contents are
slightly higher as a result of the new size thresholds. The
difference, however, is quite small, so I think my original analysis,
the one I did for the Utrect meeting, the correlation analysis, is
still more or less valid and I see the need to repeat with the new
values.

Dick, if you would still like a new analysis, I'll be happy to do so.

Darrel

Ron:
  How's the INDOEX processing going?  From Darrel's message (below), it sounds
like you have begun to re-process the INDOEX flights with Darrel's corrections
applied.  Please check carefully more than just one flight to make sure that
nothing has been effected beyond the FSSP-100 parameters. 
  Darrel- Please check more than one flight and ALL FSSP parameters that have 
changed.  I don't see a need to redo all of the detailed QC you did if the 
conclusions remain the same and the numbers are not drastically changed from
the first prodution run.  Also, please give Ron the words to put in the email 
announcing the second release of the data that describes the differences from
the first production run to the second in quantitative terms (i.e., percent
difference in concentrations, liquid water and distributions).
  Thanks for your help (both of you).

Dick,

I have finished reprocessing the FSSP-100 data for all the flights.  I started
with a production setup for the flight of interest and turned off output for
all variables except those from the FSSP-100.  (See rerun header examples
below.)  The NIMBUS processor used for this procedure has the special
code Chris added from Darrel to modify the final per-cell concentrations.
(Otherwise it is a standard NIMBUS processor.)  Darrel has been comparing the
original values from the current production data with those from this special
series of files.  My plan is to merge the new FSSP stuff overwriting the
extant ones in the production data set after review and approval.

I have looked over about 8-10 flights, comparing them myself with both ncplot
and ncpp, and found nothing really unusual.  In some cases the PLWCF values
about doubled and were a good deal higher than other LWC measurements.
I seem to recall that Darrel thought that was to be expected.

Ron

Ron,

        Andy Heymsfield and I would like to get higher rate data (10 Hz, 30 Hz?)
from the INDOEX project for the following probes:
FSSP-100, FSSP-300, Gerber, King probes.

        We are looking for these data for our studies because of the small cloud
sizes in the project (i.e., very few data points in cloud when clouds are only
200-300 m wide).

        Is it possible to get these data?  What would it involve to get access
to these data?

Thanks very much,

Greg McFarquhar

Ron,
Can you put together a tape of the reprocessed 1 second INDOEX C130 data for
all of the research flights?  Our Indian colleagues have requested this
reprocessed data.

Bruce,

Just today I received confirmation from Darrel regarding the reprocessed
FSSP-100 data.  I now must merge these data into the extant production
data set and archive the result.  After that I can make a tape.  Please
give me a "ship to" address as well as tape specifications (type, e.g.;
Exabyte; density; etc.)  I suspect this operation to take about a week
or so, barring glitches.

Ron

Ron and Dick,
I've looked at two flights in the beginning, two in the middle, and
two at the end of the INDOEX project and see nothing out of order.

Here are my words:

The FSSP measurements have been reprocessed to reflect post-project
size and sample volume calibrations. The reprocessing also includes
corrections for particle losses due to coincidence (more than a single
particle in the beam) and deadtime (particles passing through the beam
during the electronic reset period of the instrument). The
post-project size calibrations, coupled with new information about the
channel thresholds of the FSSP related to Mie scattering calculations,
extend the size range of the FSSP to 60 um from the previously assumed
47 um. This new size calibration and particle loss corrections have
little effect on the derived concentrations but LWC are on average,
about 15% higher than in the previously archived values.

For those interested in learning more about the new size calibrations,
please contact ????, and this information will be sent to you.

Darrel, Ron:
  I am satisfied with Darrel's review and words. Lets get the data out. Ron:
please check with Jason on the videos log. He was supposed to have put all of
the info in an easy to read format (table) for inclusion in the documentation.
If this has been done the videos can be sent to Steve Williams.

Greg,

We have not done any high-rate processing on the INDOEX data.  In fact, I
am now just finishing up the low-rate processing to release soon.  I suggest
you make a formal request for these data (specific time periods within the
flights would help) from one of the INDOEX project managers, Dick Friesen
<rbf@ucar.edu> or Allen Schanot <schanot@ucar.edu>.  (I will forward a
copy of this message to them, too.)

Hi Dick,

   I hope all is well at MAP, and that great data is being collected.  I am
writing you to ask for the INDOEX wing probe data to be processed at high
rate, 10 hz, for the following reason.  For our presentation at the INDOEX
Workshop in Utrecht, we used the 1 Hz data and partitioned the C130 data
set into "clean", "intermediate", and "polluted" regions based on the CN
concentration.  What we were looking for were distinct differences in the
microphysics of the clouds in each of these regions, using the wing probes,
the King Probe, and the Gerber probe.  We found that for each of these
regions, cloud width averaged 270 m, or roughly 2 sec of C130 penetration
time.  The 1 Hz average is too coarse of a spatial resolution to be able to
extract meaningful information on cloud droplet concentration, LWC, etc.,
because we are averaging zeros for part of each second with in-cloud values.
It is not obvious what the net effect of 1 Hz averaging will be, and the 10 Hz
data will help us to better characterize the differences in cloud properties
among the various regions.  Given that the clouds were scattered throughout 
flights and were not necessary concentrated in certain regions, it does not
make sense to process short intervals for given flights.  Further, we are
interested in a statistical study of the differences in clean versus polluted
clouds, and the more cloud data we have, the better the statistics of
our study.  I talked with Ron Ruth about the need for high rate data, and
he concurred that it would be best to process entire flights rather than
segments.  He also mentioned that I should provide you with priority days,
and so here is a list of the ordering:  20, 24 Feb,  11 Mar, 24 Mar,
(gradient flights), 18 Mar, 7Mar.  Please let me know if you need
additional information.

Thanks for your consideration.

Andy:
  Things are going well in Innsbruck for MAP. We have had some very good 
cases (10 flights to date), however for the last week the weather has been
very benign in the region and not good for the project.
  I understand your need for the high rate data and you are pursuing the 
right course talking to Ron Ruth. Of the six flights you mention I would 
suggest that we run one first (2/20?) and you take a look to see that you
are getting what you expect. (These will be very large files.) There are 
several things about the processing of the low-rate files that I should 
point out. The gerber probe, the liquid water probes (King probes), the 
ozone, the CVI measurements, and the ophir were all handled with special 
processing and merged back in to the main nimbus CDF file. Also, we worked 
with Darrel to put in some special processing for the FSSP-100 to account for
the lack of houskeeping data (I think you are aware of this). This code will
have to be modified to the high rate and checked out. The point of all of this
is that it is not a trivial task to produce a high rate data set with all of
the special processing incorporated for INDOEX. 
  I propose that we run a first flight without all of the special processing
except for the FSSP-100. Ron can work with Darrel and Chris to make sure
that the FSSP code is working at the high rate. The CVI and ozone data are
only available at the low rate. The ophir, gerber and King probes will not
have the offset removed without special processing. (I believe the ophir and
the King probes were sampled at the higher rate, but I am not sure what the
upper limit of repsonse of the King probes is.) The gerber probe was 
sampled at 250 sps, and Ron can process it at this rate if you wish - it will
have an offset, but should give a good reading of the fluctuations and 
structures.
  So, let me know if this proposal is satisfactory. If a first flight run 
is OK, then ron could run the rest. I would like to see Ron's first priority
finishing up the low rate data set and the associated on-line documentation.
I think that this is eminent. Any of the special processing mentioned above
will have to wait for my return to Jeffco. 
  Please send me our comments and will try and clarify anything in this 
message that you don't understand.

regards, dick

Dick,

Seems like a good plan to me. I agree, running the first case, 2/20 
makes sense.

Ron,

We got the first 7 tapes.  Thanks.

Could you please send me the unix command that you used to write the 
tapes.  I think I need to know how you wrote the tapes so that 
I can read them.

Jim,

The tapes were written via the SCD Mass Store System, so a UNIX command
was not used.  We specified a binary write with an output record size of
32768 bytes.  I did check one of the tapes with standard UNIX utilities
on our Sun system.

The two utilities you will need to handle these tapes are "dd" and "mt."

To read each tape file onto a disk, use the following:
    dd if=/dev/<your tape device> of=<your output file> ibs=32k
Tape devices have code letters to indicate density and whether to set a
"no rewind" flag.  (Otherwise you can only access the first file on a tape.)

To control the tape drive to access specific files, use the following:
     mt -f <your tape device> command [count]
     where:   command   action
              fsf       space forward [count] files
              bsf       space backward [count] files (remember to skip
                          forward one file mark after this to read a file)
              rewind    rewind tape to beginning

Count is optional (defaults to 1).  These should work with you Solaris
system, as it did with ours.

Thanks.  That's what I needed to know:  dd ibs=32k.  My student and I are

Dick and Allen,

The Video Tape Log is now on the web at the URL:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/INDOEX/102_video_log.html

I checked the log vs. the tapes in two boxes in the project storage room
(where Jason told me to find them).  They agree except that the boxes do
not contain any tapes from RF09.  The log shows that one "forward" tape
is "available," and both "down" tapes have "data missing;" the other
tapes are "not available."

What is the difference between "not available" and "data missing?"
Should I revise the log, or do you know whether someone borrowed the
tape(s) for RF09?

Otherwise, I am ready to ship the tapes off to Steve Williams.

I'm working on the INDOEX home page design.  Most of the html files are
out there for perusal, but I have not officially released any of them
yet.  (For one, I still need to incorporate Darrel's latest verbage in
the QC report.)

Just to let you know.... We've got MCR data off one tape, and 
we're able to process it.  So, looks like we can go to work.

Allen & Dick,

I have a preliminary "home page" set up for the INDOEX project summary.
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/INDOEX/nindex.html

(Note that it is "nindex.html" and NOT "index.html.")

If you have a chance, perhaps you can look it over and give me your thoughts.
I plan to dress it up a bit, but, as of now, it contains all the elements
of a standard project binder with hyperlinks added.  You may want to compose
introductory remarks; I paraphrased what Krista wrote for SHEBA.  Some of the
referenced documents still need work.

Hope you are enjoying Austria.  The weather here has been fabulous for the
last two weeks.  It's supposed to get quite cool for the weekend.

   The tapes for MAP flights 10 and 11 are on there way to you at Jeffco.
I assume you received my mail about these. They are coming via DHL and
the way bill number is 609 2908 323.
   As far as the video tapes, use your own judgement as far as modifying
Jasons file. Check with Andy Heymsfield on the missing tapes and see if he
or his student has borrowed them.

thanks, dick

Andy,

Do you and/or your student(s) have EC-130Q video tapes from any of
the INDOEX flights?  Dick Friesen mentioned that you may have borrowed
one or more of them.  

Thanks for a prompt reply.  I'm preparing to transfer them to UCAR/JOSS
who will archive them and make copies for PIs.

Ron

I got your mail yesterday and checked in with Jeff.
I'll be on the lookout for them.  They have not arrived as of now.

With the Panel Meeting taking up all of his time next week, Jeff wants me
to notify Al Cooper when I have the netCDF data ready.

Ron,

No, we went out to Jeffco to look at the tapes. At the time, we couldn't
find several of them, and informed Dick that some were missing. He couldn't
locate them. I hope you have better success.

Ron:
  Thanks for taking care of the MAP tapes for Jeff (and me). 

  I received a message from Steve Williams asking where the INDOEX video 
tapes are. He said that he had a request from Scripps for some of the tapes.
I guess I am not sure what the status is from your last email regarding 
video tapes, but as I stated, use your own discretion on dealing with the
log. I don't know what happened to the missing tapes. Several months ago
one of Andy's grad students was looking at them at jeffco. Also, Teresa
Campos looked at some but she said she returned them. Others, maaybe 
Gandrud may have borrowed some. I sent out a general RAF announcement a while
back asking if anyone knew about them. No repsonse.
  So, please contact Steve and work this out. I guess a general announcement
saying what is missing to the INDOEX community would be helpful at some 
point. To the INDOEX people it doesn't matter why the tapes are not 
available (whether the vcr was not working or they have been misplaced).

thanks, dick

I am sending this message to inform you that the revised NCAR EC-130Q data
have been released.  Except for reprocessed data from the PMS FSSP-100, all
measurements remain unchanged from the preliminary release last August.  If
you have questions regarding the FSSP-100, please contact Darrel Baumgardner
<darrel@ucar.edu>.  Please direct any questions regarding these data files
to me.

You can obtain these new netCDF data files from RAF's ftp server:

                       INDOEX EC-130Q DATA PROCESSING

I am sending this message to inform you that the revised NCAR EC-130Q data
have been released.  Except for reprocessed data from the PMS FSSP-100, all
measurements remain unchanged from the preliminary release last August.  If
you have questions regarding the FSSP-100, please contact Darrel Baumgardner
<darrel@ucar.edu>.  Please direct any questions regarding these data files
to me.

You can obtain these new netCDF data files from RAF's ftp server:

   Thanks for all of your work on this - let's hope we don't have to reprocess
(again)! How is the INDOEX we site coming? I assume it is not done since
I didn't see anything in the announcement. Allen is on vacation now until
8 November (may be back at Jeffco for a day), and I will be on vacation from
26 October to 10 November, so if any questions come up that we need to answer
they will have to wait.
   BTW, did the tapes from MAP arrive at Jeffco? Spowart and Taylor should be
wanting to look at them.

Dick,

I noticed that Mike and Dick T did view at least the 2D data.  (Chris'
ncpp program creates files with the extent "2Didx," and they exist for
RF10 and RF11; one is Dick's; the other Mike's.  I have not specifically
talked with either of them about it, however.

I briefly looked at RF10 and found that you have no TTRR.  (I remember
reading that you lost one of the Rosemount elements.)  DPT is oscillating
quite a bit starting at about 8:45; it becomes really serious at 9:30.
DPB is set up for slower response and shows no oscillation.  Looks like
QCRC froze up at about 07:59 and caused a wind computation glitch until
it melted at about 8:07.  PLWC6 swamps the other LWC measurements by a
factor of at least 4.  RHOLA1 drifted seriously between 07:31 and 08:04.

For RF11, RHOLA1 follows RHODT better than RHOLA.

I have some minor revisions to make on the web site.  Have you had a chance
to look at anything?  I'd like either your or Allen's opinion before I
release it.  Hopefully you can fire up a web browser over there to see
what I have:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/INDOEX/nindex.html
Please let me know what you want changed/added/omitted.

Steve Williams is out of town until 26 October, so I'll see about getting
him the video tapes after his return.  (It's disappointing how many of the
tapes are not available.)

May I have permission to use your GIF file "logo&header.gif" to enhance our
INDOEX web page?

Our  EC-130Q Hercules aircraft took part in the project, and I am presently
assembling information for users of the data.  I would like to use it only
on the front page of our INDOEX project summary.

Thanks.

Dick,

Hope you've had a chance to review the INDOEX web site:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/INDOEX/nindex.html
I've made some more changes over the last few days (improvements, I hope).

The QA report discusses calibration maneuvers and specifically calls out
two flighs (TF03 and RF13) saying:
   "time intervals for each set of maneuvers have been documented
    in both the flight-by-flight data quality review and on the
    individual Research Flight Report prepared for each flight."

I added the time intervals for the flight-by-flight RF13, but we don't have
flight-by-flight coverage for any of the Test or Ferry flights.  Should
we make any mention of the test flights other than the maneuver results
(i.e., they passed)?  I could add a paragraph saying that we took data
for TF01-TF04 and FF01-FF11 but have not processed them for production
output.

Should I have Jason prepare the Research Flight Reports?

In the 260X probe discussion is the following:
   "NCAR data processing uses the Baumgardner correction alogrithms
    (reference) to correct the 260X data for these problems."
What is the reference (Bulletin No. 24)?

Should I include Darrel's PowerPoint presentation on the INDOEX LWC and
Cloud Data Analysis?  It looks to me like most of the information is
covered in links I've already created.

Do you know who is preparing the reports for the SABL, AIMR, MCR, MASP and
dropsonde systems and whether I'll be getting them any time soon?  If I
know to whom each of these is assigned, I can add a "mail to:" where the
hypertext link would be.  (Getting email queries may be an incentive for
the person to finish it up.)

Should I release the site?

Hope all is going well there.

Dear Dr. Ruth,

Thank you for your inquiry.

Instead of using the GIF file from the INDOEX web page, please use the
attached INDOEX logo (globe and text) instead ("websmINDOEXlogo.gif")?
Also, could you please send the web address for your site?  Will you please
include a link on your page to the main INDOEX page
(http://www-indoex.ucsd.edu)?  If you have a printed version of your
summary, could you please send two copies (address below)?

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.  Thank you.

Sincerely,
Julie

Ron:
  I took a look. It is very impressive and I can tell you have put a great
deal of effort into this. I have answered your questions below. After you
take care of these you can release it. I think it is important to get this
out soon - we can also add to it or make corrections later - since we have
released the data.
  I will be on vacation starting Monday for about two weeks and Schanot is
also traveling, so you will not get anymore feedback from us.
  Good job and good luck.

Your suggestions are good. Make mention and add the paragraph.

  Yes, please have Jason do this (and include them on the web ?).

  Reference is:
  
  Baumgardner, D., Korolev, A., 1998: Airpseed Corrections for Optical Array
    Probe Sample Volumes. JTECH, 14, 1224-1229.

  I agree that the info seems to be contained elsewhere. I would say leave
  it out unless Darrel says otherwise. Ask him and if you do not get a prompt
  reply, leave it out.

  For MASP it will be Darrel. For MCR Krista. For SABL and AMIR it would be
RSF (Morley, Rilling, Walther ?). Aside from SABL I suspect that processed
data from these will be very slow to come out. One of Judy Curry's students
at CU has been funded to take care of the AMIR. So, see what you can find out
about SABL (I think rilling is in Boulder now), and just give references to
the other folks' email.

  Yes, after you accomplish the above.

  All is reasonably well. Having problems with the PMS 2Ds.

  See you in a couple of weeks.

Thanks for the substitute graphic.  I will use it when we have our site up.
It should be released within a week or so.  The web address is:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/INDOEX/

I will include a link to your main INDOEX page as you indicated above.

We are not planning to produce a printed version of the pages on
this site.  (You are welcome to print them from your browser.)

Dick & Al,

Thought you'd be interested in this exchange on which Darrel copied Chris
and me.  Perhaps we'll be doing more reprocessing of FSSP-100 data.

The email message below contains the variable names which the INDOEX

Steve,

I have put two boxes of INDOEX video tapes in this morning's NCAR mail.
One is virtually full; the other one almost empty.  I didn't put any
packing peanuts in the second one, and I hope that S&R won't damage any
of them by mishandling.  They are enclosed in individual sleeves.  (Video
cassettes are relatively sturdy, so long as they aren't dropped a couple
storys.)

Please let me know when you get them.

Thanks.

Ron

Ron,
I'm back from my travel for a while (at least to December!), so maybe
now I can get some "real" work done! I did find the video tapes
in my office and they did not get damaged in interoffice mail.
Do you have an list of the complete tape inventory so we know
what tapes are missing?

Thanks,
Steve

Yes.  You can find it on the web at the URL:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/INDOEX/video_log.html

It is part of the INDOEX documentation summary that I've been preparing.
Our INODEX home page is:

Ron -

Can you provide me with a list of the short variable names and the
corresponding long variable names, units and missing value codes for all
c130 variables contained in the INDOEX netCDF files?

We realize that this is contained in the netCDF files, but it is
time-consuming for us to extract such a list.

Thanks for your help.

Pat,

You can get in on the ground floor, because I'm about to announce the release
of our "INDOEX Documentation Summary" web site:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/INDOEX/

The information you want is there under the hyerlink
"Variable List (from Production netCDF File)":
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/INDOEX/varlist.html

The "missing value" for every measurement is -32767.f

Bruce,

I think the time gap is too large.  I have a feeling that NIMBUS will only
fill in about a half hour's worth of data.  (Check with Chris on this.)

"ncmerge" handles only common time periods within the two affected netCDF
files.

Ron,
For some reason, this never got forwarded to me, even though I have the forward file set in my directory.

All:
   When you get a chance please login to the RAF web site and go to the INDOEX
project and the INDOEX documentation summary. This represents the second 
attempt to put the project documentation "online", SHEBA being the first. I am 
looking for comments on the format and content of the site. I see us moving
to this type of format (i.e., website for project meta data) for all major 
projects. By major I mean multi-investigator projects that are more than just
sim;le test programs. (of course there is nothing to prevent putting all 
projects on-line other than time and effort.)
   The material in this INDOEX site just replicates info that is in our blue
project notebooks. The advantages are that it is in digital format, easy to
access, we do not have to distribute 20 notebooks, and it is easy to update.
In my mind it is not a question of whether or not we move to the online 
documentation, but rather what the format and content are. At sometime in the
future we can add data access and ordering. Please feel free to disagree with
all of this, but I feel it is time to make a decision on this and start 
defining exactly how we want to arrange the websites.
   By the way I am not taking credit for the INDOEX site. Ron Ruth did most of
the work with some help and suggestions from others. Krista made the first 
attempt with SHEBA. We need to get a handle on how much effort is required and
if Ron has enough time to do this sort of thing routinely.
   So, let's begin a discussion (via email or otherwise) and decide what to do
for MAP and future projects.

thanks,
Dick Friesen

You had asked me about INDOEX flight scientist summaries at one point.  The
2 flights that I was involved with are attached.

Bruce,

Thanks for these.  Can you please send me "990324FlightNotes.doc" (RF17) in
plain text (unless there are graphics associated with it), since I already
have the one for 990316 (RF13).  Have you checked our (RAF's) INDOEX web site
with all the flight reports:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/INDOEX/M_summary.html
You may want to check yours.  I did some minor editing for consistency among
all the reports I received.  I also found them posted off the central INDOEX
web site, but I don't remember its URL.

Ron

Bruce,

Thanks for these.  Can you please send me "990324FlightNotes.doc" (RF17) in
plain text (unless there are graphics associated with it), since I already
have the one for 990316 (RF13).  Have you checked our (RAF's) INDOEX web
site
with all the flight reports:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/INDOEX/M_summary.html
You may want to check yours.  I did some minor editing for consistency among
all the reports I received.  I also found them posted off the central INDOEX
web site, but I don't remember its URL.

Ron

INDOEX C130:	Flight 17 - Clean Cloud Indirect Forcing
March 24, 1999			Mission Scientists: B. Gandrud and A. Bucholtz

Summary:

The primary goal of this 9hr 29min mission was to measure the 
radiative and microphysical properties of clean clouds south of 
Male below the equator.  While meteorological conditions seemed
marginal in the morning before take-off we managed to find
a nice deck of low-level clouds at approximately 7.25S 72.6E to 70E
with only thin cirrus above.

We flew a stacked, multiple altitude pattern with legs high above the
cloud deck, in the clouds, just above the cloud, and a few hundred
feet below the cloud.  Spiral profiles were performed at each end
of the stack. 

This cloud field started out as one of the nicest stratus decks we've 
seen this experiment.  Some dissipation and advection of the clouds
occurred during the time it took to complete our measurement stack
but the clouds remained substantial.

Dropsondes were launched every 2 degrees from the Equator to 8S on the
ferry down, and from 6S to the Equator on the ferry home.  A dropsonde
was also dropped over Hulule from altitude as we returned.

Dick,

Back in September Bruce Gandrud wrote you (with a cc to me) about processing
the INDOEX ferry flights.  I haven't heard anything from you or other PMs
about whether or not we should do that.  On 26 October Bruce sent me a message
with a pared-down list of the variables they (U of Innsbruck group and others)
wanted for these flights:
     GLAT
     GLON
     HGM232
     PSFDC
     PALT
     ATRR
     DPTC
     XWSC
     XWDC
     WI
     MR
     CONCF
     XCNHOT
     XCNCOLD

Should we be pursuing this?  If so, at what priority?

Ron:
   I remember. I think that we should pursue this as we said we would. I would
give it a low - medium priority. Meaning we should get it done just to get it 
off of the "to do" list but not to interfere with MAP or other INDOEX stuff.
There were probably about 13 flights. We will not do a QC report, but just
check and see that they are not all screwed up. Pick one from the ferry over
and one on return to QC. We did not have PMS probes on or MASP, MCR, etc.
The stuff listed (with the exception of the 3 Clarke parameters) should be
reliable. The HGM232 may abe a problem as they often forget to turn it on.

Hi Ron

I'm at the AGU meeting this week, so I can't dig up the files and
information you need until I get back.  I hope that won't be too much of an
inconvenience.   What is your time horizon?

Teresa,

I'm in no particular hurry.  For the next few weeks I will be processing (and
archiving) the INDOEX ferry flights.  Once that job is done, I want to archive
everything.

Dick,

I did include him in the email I sent awhile back informing everyone that
the site was up.  Perhaps he didn't think to add it to his list.  I'll
contact him to make sure it gets added.

Hi Ron,

Hope you had a nice Christmas and New Year's.  Now that I am more or less
back to the grindstone, I have remembered your request for ozone processing
support files.  I used the skel program to do all the adjustments to the
TEO3C variable.  I have placed a copy of the amlib.o3.??.c file used for
each research flight in one of my temp directories, /home/tmp/campos/o3.
Do you want the other files for this version of skel to be archived, too?
If so, just let me know and I will put copies of them there, too.

Cheers,

Teresa

Teresa,

My holiays were great.  They just went by too fast.  How about yours?

I don't think that Chris has made any recent changes to the skeleton program,
so I can go with what you have given me.  Al Schanot used the skeleton for
his "coupling" changes, and his version has the full set of files.  I can
refer to those if we need to reconstruct the program

Thanks for providing these!

Have a great 2000!

Ron

Ron,
I hope you enjoyed the holidays and happy Y2K! 

Thanks for your call regarding the C-130 documentation. After looking 
over your INDOEX C-130 WWW page we decided to create two more data sets 
called:

INDOEX: Aircraft C-130 Aircraft Flight Parameters; documentation
INDOEX: Aircraft C-130 Photography Instrumentation

with direct links to your pages from the INDOEX Master List at:

http://www.joss.ucar.edu/indoex/dm/data_access_frame.html

That way we won't have to struggle to create a single "readme" file 
(like the past) and you've done a great job of organizing it as is. 
If for any reason you change plans and don't keep it on-line, let me know 
and we'll make other arrangements.

FYI, there have been PI discussions about providing a "subset" of selected
aircraft parameters much like we did for ACE-1. This would be something
like 80 parameters at 10-sec resolution. The SSG would chose the parameters
and resolution based on scientific analysis. The main purpose would be
to create a manageable on-line data set for plotting and browsing
purposes. I agreed to create it here at JOSS, but would like to involve
you or Dick when/if this passes the talking stage. After reading the
Project Manager's Quality Report I have concerns about particular sensors 
and which might be the best ones for such a subset.

Please continue to provide your input. One last question. We have
Dick's name listed as PI next to the 1-sec data set. But under data
contact, I want to use your name. Is this OK?

Thanks,
Steve

I'm not sure I like the word "Parameters."  I'd prefer "Measurements"
if you are referring to things like temperature and dew point.  We use
parameters to refer to things like Lyman Alpha Hygrometer path length.
Perhaps it is a terminology difference between JOSS and RAF.

I noticed that you run our pages inside a frame.  That creates a minor
formatting problem for some of my pages since it squeezes the width a bit.
(I have not used frames for any of our web pages.)  In particular, the
Research Flight Reports don't come out the way I designed.  (I don't know
whether that really matters, but I tried to mimic the printed pages from
which they came.)

We plan this to be a permanent location.

What is the SSG and why would they choose the measurements?  You are welcome
to discuss this with the project managers (Allen, Krista and Dick) and me.

You may want to check with the project managers to see which of them
should be the number one contact (unless you want to list all three.)
It is fine to list me as the data contact, but I'm under the impression
that you are going to handle data distribution as you do for SHEBA.
Is that not correct?  (We will handle individual special requests for
high-rate data.)

Actually its not a JOSS thing as we got the terminology from the scientific 
community. Modellers also use "parameters" to describe their fields. I don't 
think its a major issue, and to be consistent we've done it this way in the 
past. Technically, you are correct on measurements but I've also seen 
parameters defined as derived from measurements, or measurements defined
as observations!

We used frames to handle, sort, and find over 400+ expected INDOEX data sets.
However, if a user comes into CODIAC directly and clicks on the documentation
from the C-130 1-sec data set, they get a direct link to your full page. I'll 
take a look at the flt. reports, but I thought if they were HTML formatted, 
they should adjust. I'm not aware of a specified format for them.

Good! And for future projects as well I hope. The only reason I brought it 
up is that from experience in some other projects with University sites, 
pages drop out all the time (without warning). I guess this goes back to the 
age old data management arguments of centralized vs. distributed archives, 
but I prefer distributed (whenever possible) where the data provider is best 
suited to monitor and update their own data.

That's why I alerted you. Tony Clarke (and others who were also in ACE-1) 
had difficulty working with the size of the entire C-130 data set and wanted
a more manageable data set. The ACE-1 community was primarily a PC shop and
didn't have the disk or expertise then to handle the complete data set. The SSG 
(Scientific Steering Group) picked the parameters and time resolution. To date, 
this ACE-1 C-130 "subset" has been the No. 1 most accessed data set we've ever 
had on  CODIAC. But as I said, I feel strongly that the PIs may not have the 
complete knowledge to decide what parameters (or measurements) are the best! 
I believe RAF should have input here. I'll keep you posted.

If you look on the INDOEX Master List, all research data sets have a PI's
name attached. I don't think 3 will fit, so I would like to have RAF choose
one. I thought Dick was the primary project manager since we worked with
him from the very start in the planning phases. I'll leave Dick's name 
there for now. However, the important name is the data contact as they
handle the real work. The PI's name is more political.

With regard to the high rate data, as you can see I have a placeholder
for it, but no link. Perhaps in the future if there are no requests
for it, we'll put up a short page directing requests to RAF. If we
get any requests, I'll certainly pass them on.

Thanks for your help.

Hi Ron,

I'm writing to let you know of a problem I believe I have found in the
INDOEX data set.  I take a few state parameter variables (ATX, PALT, Pitch,
PSFDC, Roll, XLATC, XLONC) and use them in a model to generate data which I
can compare with the actinic flux data I took on the project.  I am finding
that some bad data (usually either just before and/or just after a data
dropout tagged with bad data flags) is included in the output file.  Here
is a specific example which you may use to check to see if I am correct, or
if I am crying wolf, so to speak.  From 05:59:01 to 05:59:56 all the
variables read non-zero but nonsensical values, just before an interval of
BDFs.  As I recall from my examination of the ozone data from this project,
this isn't just an isolated incident (though at the same time, I don't have
a feel for how extensively this type of thing occurred.)  If this is a
problem with this dataset, is there anything we can do at this point?  

Thanks for your help,

Teresa

Bruce,

It seems that there is no record that Patsy or I find of whether that tape
was shipped.  Did I give it to you for shipment?  I know that I finished
producing the tape and handed it off for "shipment" on 15 November 1999.
If it did leave here, is it possible that the tape ended up in Customs
somewhere due to lack of proper declarations?

Irrespective of that, the immediate problem is to get them their data.
I spoke with Steve Williams (UCAR/JOSS), and they are producing two CD-ROMs
with the netCDF files.  I volunteered to produce a CD-ROM with Chris Webster's
ncplot software, RAF's INDOEX web site documentation, an example ASCII
exerpt of one netCDF file (for verification) and a couple sample plots
from ncplot (probably a whole-flight XY track with wind barbs and another
of time/altitude).  I'll probably use RF01 (same as the ASCII dump).

I hope to get this done today.  If you have anything to add or suggest,
please do so ASAP.

Thanks.

Ron

Steve,

I couldn't find a way to burn a CD-ROM here at Jeffco, so I put together
a single tar file with all the stuff we discussed.  You can pick it up
via anonymous ftp from our site.
       site:  raf.atd.ucar.edu
 login name:  anonymous
   password:  <your full email address>
       mode:  BI (binary)
       path:  pub/projects/tmp
       file:  INDOEX.tar              (30.766592 MB)
              INDOEX.tar.dir          (directory of files in INDOEX.tar)

There are 3 entries in pub/projects/tmp:
drwxrwxr-x   7 ron      proj         512 Feb  2 18:00 INDOEX/
-rw-rw-r--   1 ron      proj     30766592 Feb  2 18:00 INDOEX.tar
-rw-rw-r--   1 ron      proj       18248 Feb  2 18:01 INDOEX.tar.dir

The INDOEX directory contains all the individual files in the tar file.
I created a brief README file, which, I hope, is all that is needed.

Please let me know when you have retrieved what you need or if you have
any questions or problems.

Ron

Ron, I know that you previously cut a tape of the INDOEX C130 final
processing.  In a conversation with the Indians last night, they maintain
that they never received this tape.  Could you please ask Patsy for any
documentation she has on how that tape was shipped?  As I remember, it was
in the time period prior to Christmas.

The Indian government is now asking for the data to be sent to them on a CD.
Steve Williams from UCAR/JOSS will be contacting you soon about getting your
aid/assistance in getting this data set burnt onto a CD.

You gave the tape to Patsy for shipment and when I checked with her, she
said it had been shipped.  We need better follow through and records for
this type of thing in the future as this makes all of us look like amateurs.

Ron,
As you have heard from Bruce Gandrud, the INDOEX aircraft issue
has not gone away, so I'll call you this afternoon to discuss
how we can solve this. FYI, the following e-mail (and FAX) was 
received from India late yesterday. Sounds like the best solution
might be to include the 1-sec data, NCPLOT and NCVIEW, and some
sample plots all on two CDs. Anyway, think about this and how
we should proceed.

Thanks,
Steve

Steve,

As I said on the phone, the netCDF software comes in a single compressed
tar file (netcdf-3.4.tar.Z) whose size is 1.216131 MB.  It uncompresses
to a size of 4.085760 MB.

I was easily able to convert an INDOEX netCDF file (RF11 in this example) to
ASCII using Chris Webster's "n2asc" program.  Here are pertinent file sizes:
                 Original netCDF file (102rf11.cdf) =  56.118996 MB
                 Converted ASCII file (102rf11.asc) = 151.517874 MB
   Compressed version of ASCII file (102rf11.asc.Z) =  19.822977 MB
     Gzipped version of ASCII file (102rf11.asc.gz) =  19.754439 MB

The ASCII file's shape is an array of 4,995 characters by 30,334 lines.  The
first line in the file is a header with the short variable names.  (I suppose
we would have to provide a key that gives them the long name corresponding
to each short name.)  The data then are in order of these names in subsequent
lines (one line for each second of data in the file).

I wonder whether any typical spreadsheet program could handle a file of that
size.  It certainly would be a challenge to load all that into the program;
one would need a huge amount of memory.  It would seem that it would be
prudent to split the files up into segments, but that would be quite a bit
of work for someone.  (I would guess that could be done with typical UNIX
tools in India.)

In case you want any of these files, I made them available to you via our
anonymous ftp site:

I suspect that the ascii dumps would be enormous (this is one of the reasons
why netcdf was developed in the first place).  Ron can you confirm this
(what would the ascii file size be for one INDOEX C130 flight?).

Steve, this has been my exact source of frustration with this all along (we
can send whatever is requested/necessary and implementation in India doesn't
happen for one reason or another).  I suspect that they do not have enough
of a competent unix-type individual there to get ncplot/netcdf up and
running.  There are people at jeffco that could get this running, there are
likely people at joss that could do it as well, and there are people at C4
that could do this.  It almost seems to me that the only solution may be to
send someone there to install this and get them running.  Is it possible to
find a well trained unix type person in India that could aid with this
process?  You have more experience and may know the computer types in India
better than I do.

I certainly understand that GV has a job to do and I don't harbor concerns
about him analyzing data as he implies in his message to you.  I would
dearly like to see him be able to look at this data so that we can get this
issue behind us and move on.

I am in Sweden until March 16 so I cannot do any leg work on this at Jeffco
but I am willing to help in any other way that I can.

Ron and Bruce,
Any suggestions here? Since you know the particulars about the
RAF NetCDF format better than I, can you understand their problem?
I thought they had everything they needed on the last CD batch we
prepared. BTW, the CDs we prepared were on a PC not SUN. My
personal opinion is that we supplied everything they need, but
it is a lack of understanding of NetCDF. Would the best solution
be ASCII dumps?

Let me know what you think.....

Steve

Dear Steve,
I am grateful to you for sending the Aircraft data so promptly after our
conference call. As you are kindly aware we had given you the details of the
Unix workstations we have and of course the data cd's were written using a
Sun solaris m/c which we dont have.We spent the last ten days or so
struggling / juggling with the various machine specific artifacts to read
the CD's.You may also recall that I had specifically requested you to send
the nc plot & nc view & other related software needed for effectively
reading & plotting the A/C data, so that we can really have a feel for the
scientific observations made & the data collected. Kindly note that my
objective in obtaining these Cd's is not to indulge in some exotic scintific
discoveries as you had wished me , although i would still love very much to
do so as an individual. However, the mundane & if you like the beaurocratic
nature of my job doesnt give me enough scope at present for such laudable
persuits.I am seriously constrained in time dimension to take plots of a/c
data so that the more laudable persuits of scientific research can be
carried out, unhindered within the frame work of whatever has been agreed to
at the mundane bearocratic levels.
With this humble ststement of purpose, I am constrained to state that my job
is not any simplified, as the Cd's sent by you do not contain the complete
software needed for this task.the header file was missing!as also the net
cdf library files .I would request you to kindly do your best personally, so
that I am able to read & plot the data.As explained to you earlier we are
not able to down load these files thro' internet, however much we tried,
given the status of my dial up connection and the large volume of the
files.I am pretty close to my deadline for completing my tasks.Any failure
on my part to complete this task on schedule will have some serious
repurcussions for further cooperative programs such as INDOEX.So, kindly
understand my predicament & do the needful urgently by of a CD containing
all relevant software, sent thro FED-EX.I am sorry for being so blunt & may
be rude especially knowing what a nice person Steve is, but my present
situation made me say all that.Kindly try to understand , please bear with
me. The only alternative I have is perhaps to physically be at JOSS-UCAR get
all the data from a/c and take it home.I am not preferring this alternative
as the time is too short for my deadline!
hope to receive your response & help thro' an immediate return mail & cd.
Bye & Best regards.geevee

Bruce,

Last week I did that exercise and sent the results to Steve.  I'm sorry I
didn't copy you on the message.  Here are the particulars:
     Typical INDOEX LRT flight:
                 Original netCDF file (102rf11.cdf) =  56.118996 MB
                 Converted ASCII file (102rf11.asc) = 151.517874 MB
   Compressed version of ASCII file (102rf11.asc.Z) =  19.822977 MB
     Gzipped version of ASCII file (102rf11.asc.gz) =  19.754439 MB

This ASCII file's shape is an array of 4,995 characters by 30,334 lines.
The first line in the file is a header with the short variable names.
(I suppose we would have to provide a key that gives them the long name
and units corresponding to each short name.)  The data then are in order
of these names in subsequent lines (one line for each second of data in
the file).

Ron,
Thanks for looking into this. I have passed this information on
to G.V. (India) and asked him to see if he wants the ASCII files
and/or NetCDF software Tar file. I will let you know as soon as
I hear back. Per Bruce's concern, the file sizes turned out to
be reasonable, assuming they can deal with such a large array. But
frankly, I can't think of a faster solution for them.

If you were to convert all these files to ASCII, how quickly could
this be done? I'd rather not ask you to do this until we hear
back from G.V., but in the interest of time should you start now
and perhaps write them to the Masstor? It wouldn't be a bad idea 
if someone else needed them in ASCII, but I'm not expecting any 
further requests. What do you think?

Thanks,
Steve

Steve,

To produce a "complete" set ASCII files is very simple and should be quite
fast.  I could probably knock them out in a couple hours.  If you want
them stashed to the Mass Store, I can do that, too, in fairly short order.
However, I think I'll wait for the "need" before converting all the files.

These large ASCII files can be broken down into more manageable pieces with
ordinary UNIX tools, but obviously someone needs to know how to use them.
Chris Webster told me today that Judy Curry has a version of ncplot running on
a DEC Alpha machine.  If necessary, perhaps we can try to get the executable
code from her and see if GV can run it.  The comments Bruce made about GV not
having anyone competent in UNIX rings true with me, too, and makes me wonder
whether they can effectively use anything we send them.

Ron

Ron,
Sounds like a good plan. We'll wait till we hear from them. That's
good to know about Judy, but I suspect that they will still have
problems regardless. I'll keep you posted. If we go the ASCII
route, we'll burn the CD if you convert the data and zip it.

Thanks,
Steve

Ron,
FYI..... Looks like we FINALLY heard back from the elusive G.V. 
after his "sermon" on his difficulties. I guess the remainder of
his questions will deal with data editing/QC, etc., so I'll
forward anything to you that comes in later.

Thanks for your help (and patience) so far.....

Ron,
I looked through my ACE-1 e-mail archive and this is the only e-mail
I did find regarding the PMS-2D data. I also looked on CODIAC and
didn't see a PMS-2D data set specifically. The only data sets I see
are:
ACE-1: Aircraft C-130 Composite Particle Probe Spectra (Baumgardner) 
ACE-1: Aircraft C-130 MASP Statistical Cloud Pass Data (Baumgardner) 

It is possible we did FTP the data but it was never uploaded to CODIAC.
I'll look around the "disk farm" and also check the ACE-1 CD. If you
do retrieve it, we would certainly want a copy here as well.

Sorry I couldn't be of more help, but we'll keep looking.....

Steve

P.S. The Indians (INDOEX) have been completely silent since my last
e-mail asking them if they wanted to go the NetCDF software route
or compressed ASCII files. Either they solved the problem or they
are totally pissed at us.

Steve,

Back in April 1996 I sent you a message responding to your request for
stripped PMS-2D data for ACE-1.  I was wondering if you ever pulled those
files off the Mass Store, because they were protected by a read password
which I had to give you.

Since our 1-year restriction has long-since expired, I want to recind that
password (especially since I got a request this morning to retrieve one of
the bitfiles).  My documentation must be wrong, because the read password
I recorded isn't working.  I fear that these files could be totally dead
if I cannot resurrect the password from somewhere.

Would you, by chance, have save the read password somewhere?

Thanks for looking!

Ron

Steve,

Good news!  As we thought all along, missing INDOEX video tapes were just
hidden in an unexpected place.  We found them last week in unmarked taped-up
boxes stored with our blank video tapes.

According to my records, however, we are still missing videos for RF09.
At this point, we are not sure whether none were made during the flight
or whether we just haven't found them yet.

So, perhaps you should check to see whether you have any tapes for RF09;
I don't have any record of giving them to you.

I have updated our INDOEX web site to include the newly-found tapes.

I will send them out to you today with Jeffco's noon mail pickup.

Ron

To all,

   I have set up and processed one INDOEX flight (RF03) using the basic setup
for the LRT processing and adding only the changes necessary to do HRT.  The
file is:  /jnet/productiondata/102rf03h.cdf
I looked at most of the measurements and their spectra.  I suggest, for the
HRT processing, that we use DPB as the reference instead of DPT.
   Spectral analysis was done primarily during the time period 5:00 to
5:30 UTC (with the "offending" measurements checked from 10:00 to 10:30).
Most measurements were well behaved.  Those singled out below, were worth
reporting.  Some had unusual or unexpected responses; ones that disturbed
me most are starred.
  -ATWH/ATRR coherence drops off @ about 0.5Hz where phase = 90 deg.
  -DPTC/DPBC coherence drops off @ about 0.3Hz.
  -DPB/DPBC spectrum begins flattening out about 1Hz.
 *-DPT/DPTC spectrum begins flattening out about 2Hz but takes an upward turn
    above 4.5Hz as if some other signal was aliased in.  Since this measurement
    is used for all reference humidity measurements, this behavior can be
    found in EDPC, MR, RHUM, RHODT, SPHUM, THETAE and THETAV (minor effect).
    The spectra for MRLA and MRLA1 do not show this effect.  (This behavior
    occurred throughout the flight.)
 *-FCNC spectrum takes an upward turn above 0.75Hz and has strong peaks
    @ 0.125Hz and 0.25Hz (0.1Hz and 0.3Hz @ 10:00 UTC).
  -PSFC and PSFDC coherence drops off and phase drifts @ about 2Hz.
  -QCFC and QCRC coherence drops off @ about 5Hz; phase OK.
  -TKAR spectrum has a strong peak @ 3Hz.
 *-UI, VY, WS spectra have little sharp spikes at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6Hz (5Hz
    only @ 10:00).
 *-XUIC, XVYC, XWSC spectra have little sharp spikes at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6Hz
    (5Hz only @ 10:00).
 *-VEW spectrum has sharp spikes at 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5Hz (OK @ 10:00).
 *-VNS spectrum has sharp spikes at 2, 3, 4 & 5Hz (OK @ 10:00).
 *-VSPD spectrum has sharp spikes at 6.5, 7 & 8Hz (OK @ 10:00).
 *-VSPD and WP3 coherence drops off @ about 5Hz, and phase begins drifting
    @ about 0.5Hz (45 deg @ 4Hz, 90 deg @ 8Hz).
  -ACINS and WP3 phase remains @ about 90 deg throughtout the spectral range.
 *-XPSFD bottoms out about 0.1Hz then rises to a peak @ about 0.3Hz then
    drops back down again (OK @ 10:00).

Please let me know your thoughts.  I'll make more production runs only after
approval from you.

Andy,

Thanks for your call today.  I have been preparing the high-rate processor
for the INDOEX data.  Due to limited disk space, I had no room for these large
files until the production processing was finished for some recent projects.
That being now done, I should be able to move ahead with processing the
INDOEX flights first thing next week.  I will give priority to the flights
you mentioned in your October email:

Bruce,

Yesterday, I gave it to Patsy who was going to take care of it, so I'd
ask her.

Bruce,

I think the time gap is too large.  I have a feeling that NIMBUS will only
fill in about a half hour's worth of data.  (Check with Chris on this.)

"ncmerge" handles only common time periods within the two affected netCDF
files.

Teresa,

I am trying to finish archiving all the data and support files for the INDOEX
project.  To that end, do you have the source code, calibration data and
any other pertinent information you used to make the corrections to TEO3?
I'd like to include them in the archive.

Thanks.

Andy,

Sorry this is taking longer than I hoped, but I've made progress on the HRT
processing.  A special version of the NIMBUS program is needed to handle the
FSSP data.  Also, there are some issues relating to output rates that I needed
to handle for this project.  As a result, only now have I begun to process the
data in earnest.  Previously, I had been doing test runs.

I hope to have some data on the SCD Mass Store System for you to pick up
sometime tomorrow, probably RF03, RF04 and RF11.  (Right now, there is too
little room on our ftp server to put these data.)

I'll send you another email when the files are ready.

Ron

Andy,

Three more flights are ready for you.  Below is the updated log.
RF14 is presently in transit from RAF to the SCD Mass Store System,
but it should be available within the hour.

Besides the 6 flights you requested, do you require others?

Andy,

All six (6) of your requested flights have been processed at the high rate
(25 sps).  There are a few points I should make about these HRT data, since
the files have had only primary processing done.  The final LRT (low-rate)
production netCDF data files were modified from the original processing to:
  1.  add corrected CVI measurements;
  2.  further correct the TECO Ozone data;
  3.  remove long-term drift from some measurements;
  4.  calculate an estimated surface temperature from a Heimann IR radiometer.
At this time, none of these modifications have been applied to the HRT data,
and it is unclear if or when this will occur.  The variable-specific names
affected by the above are:

   Uncorrected:
     TEO3C      Corrected TECO (UV) Ozone Concentration

   Uncorrected for drift:
     OAT        Ambient Temperature, Ophir III
     PLWCC      Corrected PMS-King Liquid Water Content
     PLWCC1     Corrected PMS-King Liquid Water Content
     PLWCF_LPI  FSSP-100 Water/Ice Content
     PLWCF_RPC  FSSP-100 Water/Ice Content
     
   Missing from HRT:
     XCNCC      Clarke - Cold CN Concentration
     XTSURF     Estimated IR Surface Temperature (K)
     CVINFLAG   Inlet; 0=CVI, 1=Whole, 2=Interstitial
     CVRAD      CVI minimum radius sampled (microns)
     CVCWC      CVI condensed water content (g m-3)
     CVN        CVI particle number concentration (cm-3)
     CVFACT     CVI concentration Factor(none)
     CVFX0C     CVI LASAIR Flow (vlpm)
     CVFX1C     CVI EM Flow 1 (vlpm)
     CVFX2C     CCNC Flow (vlpm)
     CVFCN2C    CVI EM FLow 2 (vlpm)
     CVEMSW     CVI EM Switch (volt)
     
   Missing from LRT:
     XTASHC     Aircraft True Airspeed, Humidity Corrected with SPHUM
     SPHUM      Specific Humidity

It would be relatively easy to add the CVI data and Ozone corrections,
but software development is needed for the others to handle the higher
sample rate.

Below is the latest Mass Store log.

Please let me know how you're doing.

Ron,

Thanks so much. Greg McFarquhar and I will have alook at it in the next few
days, then will get back to you. Again, thanks!

Ron:

We examined data from some of the flights, and the results are 
fantastic. We are
able to examine horizontal homogeneity in the cloud droplet number 
concentration,
and see how cloud width affects the mean droplet concentration. In one case
we examined, where the cloud is only a few seconds wide, the mean 
concentration we
came out with from our earlier analysis is roughly half of the true 
peak concentration.
Based on examination of the data, we would greatly benefit from the high rate
processing of the entire data set. Would that be possible, and should 
I look for
more storage space for you?

Thanks,
Andy

Andy,

I will undertake the task of processing the remaining INDOEX flights at
high rate.  This will take awhile, since I must mix it in with all my other
tasks.  Depending on how quickly this gets done, I plan to send you periodic
email messages giving you an updated Mass Store bitfile list of processed
flights.  Please be aware that the QC on these data have been done on the
low-rate only but should, in general, pertain to the high-rate data.

As it turns out, I can handle the storage space problem by judicious planning.
I will move files to our RAID server after processing then to the Mass Store.

Ron

Ron,

	I am working with Andy  Heymsfield on the high resolution rate
INDOEX data and have a quick question.  On the 1Hz processed data,
a post-project size calibration extending the range of FSSP-100 to 60 um
from the previously assumed 47 um was used.  However, when compring LWCs
in PLWCF_LPI with those calculated from the derived spectra (CFSSP_LPI),
it appears that the 3 um spaced binnings up to 47 um are being used with
the 10 Hz data.

	I'm assuming that to get the most accurate value of LWC I should
use CFSSP_LPI with the post-project size calibrations (to 60 um) rather
than the values in PLWCF_LPI.  Is this correct?

Thanks,

Greg

Greg,

The 47 set was used for RF01 - RF03.  The 70 set was used for RF04 - RF18.
Two different probes were involved:  
  RF01-RF03:  AFSSP_LPI:SerialNumber = "FSSP109"
  RF04-RF18:  AFSSP_RPC:SerialNumber = "FSSP122"
You may want to contact Darrel Baumgardner to see whether this was the
correct thing to do.

Just an informational note:  The LRT (low-rate) data were processed the

Andy,

All 18 of the INDOEX flights have now been processed at high-rate (HRT).
I have archived the production netCDF files to the SCD Mass Store System
(MSS).  Below is the MSS bitfile log for these data.

The QC for these flights has been done only for the LRT (low-rate) files
but should pertain to the HRT data.  The only difference I found was
on some flights, the reference dew-point sensor had some unexpected
high-frequency spectral components.  This behavior propagated to any
dependent, high-rate derived measurements, such as Equivalent Potential
Temperature.

To all,

I have completed the HRT processing of all INDOEX flights.  The data have
been archived to the SCD Mass Store System (MSS).  I have informed Andy
Heymsfield that all data are available for him.  As mentioned before,
these files come straight from the special INDOEX version of NIMBUS (to
handle the FSSP data) and have had no special files merged into them as
was done for the LRT data.  (Andy didn't seem particularly concerned.)

Locally, I have put the files in the temporary directory:  /jnet/data/INDOEX/
in case any of you want to have a look at them.  I will now update the INDOEX
web site to add information about these data to the pages.

Thanks much. I'll have a look at it as soon as possible. Thanks for the effort
you put into the processing. It will really help out our analysis.

Hello Ron,

I am trying to work some final bugs out of my dataset from the INDOEX
project and it appears that my instrument is sensitive to ambient
temperature.  I am therefore interested in obtaining aircraft cabin
temperature data for all of the C-130 research flights during the INDOEX
IFP.  The raw/1second data would be fine.

Is this still possible?

Hi back to you, Sarah

I'm afraid that we didn't record any temperature inside the C-130 cabin.  We
regularly record a cabin barometric (static) pressure, but not temperature.
You may want to poll the other PIs for INDOEX to see if any of them kept a
record of it.  I would suspect that the temperature would not be constant
throughout the cabin, and that you would want a measurement in close proximity
to your instrument.

Good luck.

Ron

Teresa & Ron:

Do we have an answer here?  I pulled up flight 102rf08 and he is right.
Didn't we merge in the chemistry data post production?  Could it be 
that someone did a rerun and not a merge?  These project details all 
sort of merge (pun) together in my mind after a while.  The values for 
CO are there (Vdc), but just zeros for COCAL, COCOR, COZRO.

Al and Ron:

The O3 data were merged into the RAF netCDF files, but the CO data were 
submitted separately to the JOSS archive, so that is why the RAF files 
contain BDFs.  I have copies of the CO data in ascii format and would be 
willing to archive them on the mass store, but I didn't want to go through 
the hassle of matching the times exactly in order to be able to merge the 
CO data into the RAF files.  For some reason the skeleton program or the 
extraction utility shift things by one second or more.  Not to mention
that I broke each flight down into several subset files whenever the zero 
setting was changed; this made data processing more accurate.  Let me know 
how you would like to set this up in our archive.  Thanks,

Teresa

Teresa,

For now, I'd like to archive the ASCII data files in our INDOEX data path.
(Are the files here at Jeffco?) That way I can handle requests for these data.
At any rate, we should arrange to give Mahesh these files.  I'll check out the
JOSS site, but if they seem difficult to retrieve from there, I'll make them
available at our ftp site.

Ron

Dear Mahesh,

The CO data for this project never were merged into the final production
aircraft data set.  Instead Teresa Campos has made these data available
as ASCII files via the UCAR/JOSS archive which you can access via the
following URLs:
     http://www.joss.ucar.edu/cgi-bin/codiac/dss?22.044
     http://www.joss.ucar.edu/data/indoex/docs/c130.co.readme.txt

Questions regarding the CO data can be directed to:
  Teresa Campos
  Atmospheric Chemistry Division
  National Center for Atmospheric Research
  P. O. Box 3000
  Boulder, CO 80307-3000
  phone:  (303)497-1879
  email:  campos@acd.ucar.edu

If you have any other questions regarding the C-130 INDOEX data, you may
again contact Allen Schanot or me.

Bruce,

How about giving me the complete address to

Dick and Ron,

I received and email message from Cindy Twohy this morning, and she 
asked if the subset ASCII files that we generated after each INDOEX 
research flight were ever archived or backed up anywhere.  Apparently, 
she has a new computer system and can't presently use the netCDF files 
very easily.  So, she's wondering if the ASCII files might be available 
for her use.

Do you guys know if these files presently exist anywhere, either on the 
MSS or in the JOSS archive?

Thanks.

Krista

Krista,

I haven't checked the JOSS archive, but there are no ASCII files on the
Mass Store.  In the INDOEX Production directory, there is a CVI subdirectory
(/jnet/shared/proj/102/Production/CVI) with gzipped ASCII and netCDF data.
Could those be the files she wants?

Ron

Looks like I'm out of luck--those CVI files are the actual CVI data, and
JOSS only has the main aircraft data files. Guess I'll have to join the 21st
century and get ncplot running over here somewhere.

Thanks anyway,

Cindy

Ron,
How should I handle this? Can we access these data through your
interactive WWW page? If so, I'll make a link to that page if this
data set shows up on the pull down menu.

Thanks,
Steve

P.S. The ACE-Asia data workshop is next week. What's the status
of the re-processed RF03 data? BTW, I received two more questions
on the DAY parameter claiming it was wrong for flights originating
on a previous day. I replied explaining the DAY parameter was the
"start_time". But confusion still reigns.....

Also, Dick will you be there in Pasadena? I suspect there may be
other data questions. I do plan to bring the 1 Hz data and the
subset on CD ROM in case anyone needs it. I will wait till Ron
makes any last minute changes to these data. Let me know......

Steve,

The PMS-2D data are not available interactively, largely because of their
raw form and no available software (and that I haven't yet decided to add
it to the interactive system).  You can pull them from the MSS.  They
are in the path:  RAF/1999/102/PMS2D/fltno
   where:  fltno is the flight number/segment

Below is a complete listing of all the stripped PMS-2D data files.  I have
no time information for them, but the flight number can be used to get the
flight date and start/end times for the entire flight.

I thought that Allen was going to rerun RF03 last week, but he had other
things going on.  After discussions with Dick and Allen this morning,
I will reprocess the data today and hopefully have it ready later this
afternoon.  I'll let you know when it's ready.  (I could be some time
tomorrow, if I run into glitches.)

The DAY confusion will remain.  My recommendation to any users would be
to totally ignore the "YEAR," "MONTH" and "DAY" variables in the data
files and instead use "base_time" and "time_offset" as the official
time reference.  The only real problem there is that one needs a UNIX
time decoder.

Anuja,

I just thought I'd give you the same information I gave you over the phone
this morning in case you didn't get a chance to write it down.

Here at RAF, Chris Webster <websterc@ucar.edu, (303)497-1044> has written
UNIX-based software for accessing our netCDF files (ncplot).  He also may
be able to give you pointers for Windows software.  (I'm not sure how much
he knows about the software you mentioned for running UNIX applications
under Windows.)

We have used commercial packages MATLAB and IDL with our data files.  One
of our staff, Mike Spowart <spowart@ucar.edu, (303)497-1041>, has experience
using MATLAB.

Dr. Ramen asked me about the possibility of getting ASCII data files on tape
for INDOEX (in case you cannot find software that will handle our netCDF
files).  Doing this will take me some time, so if he is in a hurry, I'd like
to know soon whether you need data in this form.  I also will need to know
what tape format(s) you can read.  This has two flavors:  1) type of tape,
e.g., high-density Exabyte, DLT, 1/2" round, etc., and 2) whether you can
read files in tar format.  We can discuss this more fully if you decide that
you need this kind of data.

Hope this helps you.

Ron

Ron,

Included below (at the very end of the message) is a request from Olga Mayol
Bracero for some of the INDOEX ferry data.  I've also included the message
with some of Dick's comments on this matter.

Can you please check into what is available in the RAF data archive for INDOEX
and see if the ferry flight data can, in fact, be made available to Olga?
Olga's email address is listed at the end of the message.

Thanks for your help on this.

Krista

Dick and Krista,

Bruce Gandrud was in contact with the INDOEX people in Europe, and in October
1999 gave he me a list of requested ferry-flight measurements from Dr. Armin
Hansel, University of Innsbruck.  Based on that list, I processed the ferry
flights (without an in-depth QC), archived them to the Mass Store and made
them available on our anonymous ftp site.

The list of measurements is:  GLAT, GLON, HGM232, PSFDC, PALT, ATRR, DPTC,
XWSC, XWDC, WI, MR, CONCF_LPI, CONCF_RPC, XCNHOT and XCNCOLD.  For the
outbound ferry flights, the above list was used.  For the return flights,
CONCF_LPI was not available, and DPBC was substituted for DPTC.  I'm not
sure exactly what other measurements Olga needs.  I propose we give her
the data files already available for download from our anonymous ftp site
and via the INDOEX web page:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/INDOEX/ftp_log.html

If that measurement list is too restricted, we'll have to figure out what
other measurements from the standard processing we can give her, but,
obviously, we would have to reprocess.

I'll write to Olga giving her this list and the availability information.
If she needs more, I'm sure we'll hear from her.

Ron

Dear Olga,

Krista Laursen passed your data request on to me.  We did LRT (1 sps)
processing of the INDOEX ferry flights based on a list of requested
measurements from Dr. Armin Hansel, University of Innsbruck.  (Only
a brief quality check was made on the data.)  The gzipped, netCDF

The measurements are:  GLAT, GLON, HGM232, PSFDC, PALT, ATRR, DPTC, XWSC,
XWDC, WI, MR, CONCF_LPI, CONCF_RPC, XCNHOT and XCNCOLD.  For the outbound

--------------------------------------------------------

I suggest you download these files to see if they will work for you.  If
not, let us know what extra measurements you need, and we'll see what we
can do.  Of course, not all of RAF's instruments were operating on these
flights, and I don't know about the other scientists' equipment that we
recorded on our data system.  (A check with each scientist may be in order.)

Best regards,

Ron

Dear Ron,

I need some of the INDOEX (IFP) C-130 aircraft data for my data analysis
and tried to get
them from your server.
Could you please inform me, where I can find this files. Thank you in
advance.

Best regards, Reinhard Gabriel

Ron,

I'm a software engineer with JOSS and I'm extracting some fast data from
INDOEX C130 flights RF01, RF05, RF07, RF09, RF10, and RF12. I'm doing
this at the request of a user, but I am not familiar with the aircraft
data. Using ncextract I can get the 8 requested parameters out, but I'm
not sure if they are 20Hz data. Is there only one sampling rate in each
data file, and is it 20Hz?

Jose Meitin referred me to you for more information on these files.
Specifically, I wondered what the Vector16,  Vector32, and Vector64 are,
and if I have to take them into account.

Thanks in advance,
Don

Don,

The netCDF header for each data file describes the sample rates for each
measurement.  For examples from INDOEX RF01:
        float CNTEMP(Time) ;                       <-- 1 sample per second
        float ADIFR(Time, sps25) ;                 <-- 25 samples per second
        float A260X_OBL(Time, sps10, Vector64) ;   <-- 10 samples per second,
                                                       64 channels

In effect, the array space is defined by these parameters.
   Time      1st dimension (elapsed seconds, offset from UNIX "base_time," UTC)
   spsXX     2nd dimension (samples of measurement in one second)
   VectorXX  3rd dimension (number of channels for a measurement)

In the case of the PMS 1-D probes, each channel represents a size bin and
is described further by other header parameters.

I suggest doing a "ncdump -h" on the file, and you will see the structure
of all the measurements.  For this project, the high-rate data are present
when a measurement has a high-rate component and low-rate when they don't.
Therefore, the high-rate data set will have a mix of data rates identified
for each measurement.

If a user is concerned with time alignment, the sps1 measurements are a mean
of the sampled data in one second and should be placed at the mid-point of
the higher-sampled measurements for those variables that have a SampledRate
greater than 1.

I hope I've made things clearer, but if you have more questions about our
format, please contact me again.

Please say "Hi" to Jose for me.

Ron

Ron,

Thank you for your helpful information on the parameters 
in the INDOEX C130 netCDF files. I can understand better 
what I am looking at now and will work on refining my 
extraction to get the data that is wanted.

I'll see Jose tomorrow and will pass along your greetings.

Don

Ron,

I believe I understand the netCDF format of your C130 flight data
now to see that the flight level data for the following INDOEX flights
were recorded at 1 per second. But I'm not sure what to make of the 
following data request which I have received:

>	We would need fast (20Hz) C130 data of the following parameters for the
>	flights :
>	>	RF01    0945 to 1456(end)
>	> 	RF05    0648 to 1302(end)
>	> 	RF07    0635 to 1100
>	>	 RF09    0735 to 1258(end)
>	>	 RF10    0847 to 1200
>	> 	RF12    0845 to 1105 
>	
>	GPS corrected horizontal wind speed (XWSC) 
>	GPS corrected horizontal wind direction (XWDC) 
>	GPS corrected wind vector- east component (XUIC) 
>	GPS corrected wind vector- north component (XVIC)
>	GPS corrected wind vector-vertical gust component (XWIC)
>	Potential Temperature  (Theta)
>	Absolute humidity, top (RHODT)
>	Raw TECO ozone output (TEO3) 


Is there 20Hz data of these parameters in some file I am not aware of,
or do you think they want the 1Hz data in these files, but refer to
the fast data because it comes from files with fast data, too? It's also
possible that they want data that hasn't been archived. 

I ask you this question before I go back to them and ask, because I want to 
make sure I know what I am talking about before I do.

Thanks again for your help,
Don

Don,

We did produce a high-rate (HRT) data set for INDOEX.  The "high" data rate,
however, is 25 sps, not 20 Hz.  The files cannot be retrieved from our web
site like our low-rate data, but they have been archived to the SCD Mass
Store System in the path:  /RAF/1999/102/HRT/RFxx.cdf.  You are welcome to
retrieve them from there.

You can view the high-rate data catalog on the web at:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/l_taplog/taplog.hrt.102
It lists flight numbers, dates, start/end times, etc.

There is an example HRT netCDF header at:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/l_header/Header.102

You should be able to accomodate the request except for the following:
  1)  Most of the requested measurements will be at 25 sps instead of 20 Hz.
  2)  RHODT and TEO3 were output at only 1 sps, because they have no
        high-frequency components.  (On the aircraft, the raw data were
        sampled at 5 sps.)
  3)  I'm not sure why the requestor doesn't want TEO3C, which has the
        corrected Ozone measurement.  You may consider putting out both
        of them.
  4)  I'm surprised that more measurements weren't requested, like
       latitude, longitude, altitude or static pressure.  I'm not
       going to use these data, however, so I don't know the real need.

If you need anything more, please let me know.

Ron

Ron,

Thanks again for your help with the format of the C130 HRT data.
Your suggestions were certainly appreciated, and our user expressed
a need for the geo-positioning parameters, and an interest in the
TEO3C parameter. I'm sure this saved us having to send more data later.

I accessed your files on Mass Store with no problem, and extracted
the parameters of interest. It all fit on a CD and is now on its way
to the user.

Thanks again for your assistance,
Don

Dear Longjiang,

Dick forwarded your request to me.

I can prepare this data set for you, but I have some questions.
 1)  Do you want both Ferry and Research flights?
 2)  What type of media do you want?  We can offer you:
   a)  8mm (Exabyte) tape, high-density preferred
   b)  DLT
   c)  CD-ROMs
 3)  What type of operating system will you be using to read the data?

When these questions are answered, I can schedule the data copy and shipment.

Ron

Ron,
    Is there data from the PCASP for INDOEX?
Thanks, Jim Hudson

Jim,

Yes, there is PCASP data for INDOEX.  The measurements are in the production
data set.

APCAS_IBL:long_name = "PCAS Raw Accumulation (per cell)" ;
APCAS_IBL:CellSizes = 0.1f, 0.12f, 0.14f, 0.17f, 0.2f, 0.25f, 0.3f, 0.4f, 0.5f, 0.7f, 0.9f, 1.2f, 1.5f, 2.f, 2.5f, 3.f ;

Ron,
	Thanks very much.  I am told that the inlet of the PCASP is often
heated.  Do you know if this was the case during INDOEX?
Thanks, Jim

Jim,

I just spoke with Allen Schanot, and he told me that the PCASP used for
INDOEX was borrowed.  We could not measure flow, however, it was the same
as RAF's PCASP in all other respects including deicing.

Ron,
In going back over the INDOEX data sets, I decided to link the
C-130 flight line data to your mass store order page at:
http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/mss_retrieval/. I may also do that
for all the projects rather than duplicating off-line tapes here.

However, I couldn't find the aircraft data for INDOEX. I know you
have it on the Mass Store, so perhaps it's just not included on
the pull down menu? Could you check for me?

We had another PI report a problem with the DAY parameter (I was
beginning to notice that no one else noticed!). Anyway, let me
know what the status is of your analysis and what you suggest
we do. This other PI also assumed that the DAY parameter would
roll over at midnight, so I think we need to either make that happen 
or educate them!

Thanks,
Steve

Steve,

I screwed up on the INDOEX data availability.  The files CANNOT be retrieved
using the ATD Data Retrieval (ADR) web page:
     http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/mss_retrieval/
I have now changed our INDOEX web site to reflect that.  INDOEX data retrieval
is now set up via the web page:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/INDOEX/ftp_log.html
and uses its own data retrieval system (basically a custom modification of
the ADR.)

Basically, any project prior to CY 2000 will not be available via the ADR
web page.  For those projecss which have an RAF on-line web site, there will
be a page:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/<project>/ftp_log.html
for data access.  One exception is the MAP project which we did specially;
the ADR web page can be used for it.  All future RAF projects' data will be
available using the ADR web page.

I guess this is sticky.  RAF Bulletin No. 9, Appendix B, URL:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Bulletins/b9appdx_B.html#DAY
states that the DAY, MONTH and YEAR variables have static values which relate
to the start of data-taking by the on-board data system.  (It actually makes
those variables rather useless, in my opinion.)  All our archived production
data files have the same "problem" regarding DAY, MONTH and YEAR--they
never change.  I'm hoping that our software can be updated in the future to
increment when they should, but I don't really have the resources or time to
"correct" those date fields in all our archived data.  So I guess the best
way to handle those measurements is to, as you wrote, "educate them."

The reference time in the netCDF files, the measurement that SHOULD be used,
is "base_time" plus "time_offset."  Unfortunately, this is a bit obscure
for those who don't have an easy way to convert UNIX time to something more
readable.  (RAF's utility "ncplot" does do that, however, it doesn't have
a Micro$oft version.)

Dick,

You did send me this request.  On Wed Sep 26 I sent Longjiang an email message
asking for media (Exabyte, DLT, CD-ROM) and whether to include Ferry, Research
or both.  I have not gotten a reply.

I just called him at the supplied phone number.  He thought he replied to me
but had some email problems.  At any rate, I'm now taking care of his request.

Ron

Dear Ron,

Thanks for your calling this noon. I tried the website given by you and it 
seemed that the ATD Data Request Form does not take the two-word city (like 
La Jolla or San Diego) as valid input. When inputting San Diego as city, I 
got log error. However this problem can be avoided by input San_Diego.
Anyway, I will download all low rate data. If any problems come out, I will 
contact you. Please copy those high rate data into CD-ROM and send to us by 
the address below.

Thanks,
Longjiang

Steve:
  The "raw" 2d image data is archived on the NCAR Mass Store. Ron Ruth
can tell you how to access it. We do not have a processing program for
it. Most investigators take the raw images and do their own analysis. We
do have a program called xpms2d that we will share with investigators
that does some analysis online interactively, but it does not save
analyzed data to a file.

Summing the cells is the correct answer.  There was a Darrel correction, 
that didn't make it to CONCF.

if (strncmp(&(varp->name[1]), "FSSP", 4) == 0)
  concentration[i] = concentration[i] / (1.0 - 6.0e-4*concentration[i]);

Ron -

The INDOEX data for the MCR is ready to archive.  It's my understanding
that copying data from the /scr/carolan area would take the same amount
of time as /jnet/mcr.  The data resides on:
     /scr/carolan/tschudi/INDOEX/rfxx, where xx is the flight number.
Note that this is the final, processed data.  Let me know when the
archive is complete so I can delete the files.

Thx,

Mark

Mark,

Thanks for the update.  I'm swamped this week (and I'm planning to take off
next week) getting the DYCOMS-II web site released before the end of the week.
I don't know whether I'll make it or not.

If you have an urgent need to get the data archived, perhaps I can help you
customize a script I wrote that will allow you to do it.  I could meet with
you tomorrow.  (I'm at FL-1 today.)

No problem.  I'll just leave the data on /scr/carolan/tschudi/INDOEX and you
can archive it after your vacation.

I have an MCR web page for DYCOMS II - can that be linked into the DYCOMS site?
It's at:  http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/~tschudi/DYCOMSMCR.html

Mark,

Well, I'm not sure.  It depends on whether you allow data access from your
site.  Because of the restricted-data agreement with this project's PIs,
any data access must go through the "login/password" site I set up.  If you
just have  "examples" and information, I can add the link.

I'll try to get a chance to look at it soon.

Ron

Ron - the site is just examples only - no data access,  so it can be added.

Pls hold off archiving the INDOEX data after the holidays.  I've
discovered what could be a calibration issue that may result in
reprocessing the data.

Mark,

I will be on vacation until 2 January, so I'll await your word before
archiving any MCR data.

Ron,
I double checked the e-mail alias for the complete INDOEX list which
is as follows: indoexlist@fiji.ucsd.edu
This is a pretty big distribution, so you should reach everyone.

Since we have a subset of the INDOEX C-130 data on-line via CODIAC, is 
there something we need to do regarding these data? I can also run a
script to list who ordered this data set if that would help. Also,
in light of our recent strategy with your ATD data access page, we'll
switch to links rather than duplicate tapes here for both 1 Hz and "fast" 
data.

To all,

This memo has been sent to alert users of the final production flight-level
netCDF data for the NCAR/RAF EC-130Q Hercules aircraft of an error in one
of the measurements.

In December 2001,  Cynthia Twohy (Oregon State U) discovered differences
between CONCF_LPI, FSSP-100 Concentration (all cells), and CFSSP_LPI,
FSSP-100 Concentration (per cell).  By totaling all the bin values in
CFSSP_LPI, one should get the same total as CONCF_LPI.  Such is not the
case with this data set; instead CONCF_LPI is generally less--up to about
8% at the highest concentrations.

Upon analyzing this descrepancy, RAF found that a correction equation from
Darrel Baumgardner was applied to the CFSSP_LPI calculation but omitted from
the CONCF_LPI calculation.  To obtain a correct value for CONCF_LPI, one needs
to sum up all the values in CFSSP_LPI and use that total instead.

Because the data are recoverable within the data files, RAF is not planning
to reissue a "corrected" data set at this time.

Mark,

Just thought I'd give you a progress report on INDOEX MCR data archiving.

Things are going smoothly albeit a bit slowly.  I began sending the files
up to the SCD Mass Store System (MSS) on Wednesday afternoon starting with
RF01.  As of now, the data have been archived through RF09.  RF10 files
are presently being moved.  At this rate (about 5 flights per day), the
process should be completed by the end of the day next Monday.  (I monitor
the archive progress during the day rather than let it go at night.)

I'll let you know when all the files have been archived.

Ron -

The MCR data for INDOEX is now processed and ready to upload to mass
store.  It is at /scr/carolan/tschudi/INDOEX, with subdir's for each
flight # (note there is no data for rf03).

I also have mcrview, the IDL program that displays the mcr data.  We'll
talk about how to make that available via the web.

Thx -

Mark

Thx,

Mark,
Good plan. Do you know if it will be accessible via the ATD Data
Retrieval page like the C-130 data? If so, we will link to that page.
If not, you or Ron can send me the pathname and we'll make the link 
via the INDOEX Master Data Set List page. Let me know when ready.....

Mark,

I have completed archiving to the SCD Mass Store System all the processed
MCR files for 1999-102 INDOEX.  I also revised the INDOEX web site to list
the available files to be downloaded with hyperlinks.

I still have some work to do on the web site, but the eata are available via
the following links:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/INDOEX/ftp_log.html

Please let me know what you think.  (I plan to add a hyperlink to the
INDOEX home page, too, under the two netCDF file links.

You can reach me by email or call me at home (720)872-6453.

Great - thx, Ron, it looks fine.  We can talk about getting the viewing software
available online too.

Mark,

Since, at this time, the "master" list for INDOEX MCR data reside within the
"ftp log" for the project, I will create a separate one for you (I haven't
done it yet.) with the URL:
   "/Projects/INDOEX/MCR_catalog.html"

In the meantime, you can use the individual flight URLs:
     "/Projects/INDOEX/MCR/RF01.html"
     "/Projects/INDOEX/MCR/RF02.html"
     "/Projects/INDOEX/MCR/RF04.html"
     "/Projects/INDOEX/MCR/RF05.html"
     "/Projects/INDOEX/MCR/RF06.html"
     "/Projects/INDOEX/MCR/RF07.html"
     "/Projects/INDOEX/MCR/RF08.html"
     "/Projects/INDOEX/MCR/RF09.html"
     "/Projects/INDOEX/MCR/RF10.html"
     "/Projects/INDOEX/MCR/RF11.html"
     "/Projects/INDOEX/MCR/RF12.html"
     "/Projects/INDOEX/MCR/RF13.html"
     "/Projects/INDOEX/MCR/RF14.html"
     "/Projects/INDOEX/MCR/RF15.html"
     "/Projects/INDOEX/MCR/RF16.html"
     "/Projects/INDOEX/MCR/RF17.html"
     "/Projects/INDOEX/MCR/RF18.html"

Example usage for the above:
     <a href="/Projects/INDOEX/MCR/RF01.html">RF01    02/16/1999   06:51:03   14:56:01</a>

Since we are all within the RAF domain, one doesn't need the full URL:
     "http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/INDOEX/MCR/RF01.html"

I asked Chris, and he has already created an "MCR" directory for you:
     /jnet/ftp/pub/src/MCR
He already made you the owner, so you can already dump stuff into it.

As we discussed earlier today, in the "RAF's Instrumentation and Measurements"
web page I added the link to your MCR page for the MCR entry at the bottom of
the page.

When you get all the software loaded onto the FTP site, I'll add (or ask
Chris to add) the MCR software link to the "RAF Software Product Guide."

Until we get specific requests for SHEBA's MCR data files, I don't think I'll
create the data catalog for them yet (a lot of work for little result).

I'll be in touch.
