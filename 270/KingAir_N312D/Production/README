                 SPECIAL DATA PROCESSING INFORMATION FOR PROJECT 4-270
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------

        In general, data processing for Project 4-270 is fairly "automatic,"
        with all of the necessary information (i.e. calibration coefficient
        references, "Defaults" file information, etc.) contained in the
        setup files and "FlightGroups" file in the "Production" subdirectory
        of the project 270 directory.  However, for flights 1, 2, and 5,
        special steps must be taken in order to correctly process the data.
        These steps are outlined below.

        A GENERAL NOTE:  If you wish to obtain FSSP data for any given flight,
        you MUST be sure that the variables "AFSSP_*" and "CFSSP_*" are turned
        on for output.  Output of these two quantities is NOT on by default
        in the various setup files.


        -----------------
        Flights R1 and R2
        -----------------

        For these two flights, begin by processing the data using the setup
        files ("Flight_1" and/or "Flight_2") in the "Production" subdirectory.
        Next, special processing needs to be done to take into account the 
        installation of the /10 jumper on the control module for the AES
        Extended Range FSSP.  Run the Nimbus skeleton stored in the "Production"
        subdirectory--this is done by typing "skel".  This program will generate
        the correct data for the following five variables:  FBMFR_IBR, FSTB_IBR,
        CONCF_IBR, PLWCF_IBR, AND CFSSP_IBR.  (These variables contain AES
        FSSP data.)  Finally, run the program "ncmerge", using the "-v" option,
        to merge these five variables into the original netCDF output file
        you generated using the default setup files.  For information on how
        to use "ncmerge", see the "man" pages for this program.


        -----------------
        Flight R5
        -----------------

        During this flight, both the AES Extended Range FSSP and the RAF SN#6
        FSSP were interfaced into ADS.  To process the data for this flight,
        begin by running Nimbus using the default setup file ("Flight_5") in
        the "Production" subdirectory for project 270.  Before running Nimbus,
        turn off the output for all "_IBR" variables, and turn on the output
        for all "_OTH" variables.  This will assure that only the RAF FSSP
        data is calibrated and output to the output netCDF file.  Having 
        generated this first output file, run Nimbus again, but manually load
        the setup file called "Flight_5_AES" in the "Production" subdirectory.
        This will cause the AES FSSP data to be calibrated and output correctly
        to a second netCDF output file.  Finally, run the program "ncmerge",
        using the "-v" option, to merge the following variables from the
        second output file into the first:  AFSSP_IBR, FRNG_IBR, FRST_IBR,
        FSTB_IBR, CFSSP_IBR, CONCF_IBR, DBARF_IBR, DISPF_IBR, FACT_IBR,
        FBMFR_IBR, and PLWCF_IBR.  This final netCDF output file will now
        contain both the AES and RAF FSSP data.


Notes on high-rate 4-270 NIMBUS processing for Paz Ramos-Johnson of the
TASC Corp. in Reading, Mass.

Processing was non-standard in that only a small subset of the data were
written to the output files.  Since this resulted from a special request
for data, the MSS path chosen to archive the files is also special:
/RAF/1993/270/HRTS.

Following are the messages from NIMBUS for each of the processed data sets:
