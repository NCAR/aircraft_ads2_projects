Ron--

The program Chris W. wrote (xtv) to look at ADS tapes is not giving me
the information that I thought it would regarding the length of the
tape, etc.  I believe Chris is out today, but I'll check with him as
soon as he gets back and try to find a way to get you the information
you need.

Do you have any information about the tapes you gave me this morning, like
start/end times, number of records, total bytes?  It will greatly help my

Ron--

Processing of the Project 4-270 data is complete.  Chris was able to 
copy the necessary setup files and "Defaults" file information to
the Production subdirectory.  All that remains is for Chris to move
the Nimbus skeleton needed to process some data for flights 1 and 2
into the Production subdirectory.  So, you can go ahead and save
copies of the processed data up to the mass store....I'll go ahead
and copy the netCDF files onto tape for Paul Lawson.

All of the netCDF files are in the /home/local/data directory and
follow the same naming convention.  They begin with the project number
and flight number and have the suffix ".cdf".  For example, flight 5
data is in "27005.cdf".  Note that there is no file for flight 4, since
the tape was bad.

Barb will need a copy of the mass store bitfile log once you have
transferred the data files.  Also, she needs you to sign the letter 
from the RAF data manager.

Thanks for your help.  Let me know if you have any questions.

I discussed this with Chris yesterday, and he instructed me to reprocess
the data logged on as myself.  That's what I've done, and all of the
data is now stored in hl data.  However, I'm going to move it to staticdata
so it doesn't get scrubbed again.  I'll place an ASCII document in the
Production subdirectory to explain all of the special processing that
needs to be done.  But past that, Chris has put all of the files in
Production that will be needed for any future processing, and I have found
no problems with them.  You shouldn't have any problems, but see Chris
if you do.

Krista,

Sorry to say I have moved none of your files to the Mass Store.

If you haven't `touched' these files within two weeks of last access, there is
a good chance that the scrubber got you.  I thought I mentioned this problem,
so you could protect yourself.  This also happened to Al Schanot with the
NARE-AIR project.  The purged files have been saved on backup ExaByte tapes.
See Rob or Brenda for instructions on restoring them.  (Al Schanot may also
remember.)  It would help to know when they disappeared.

I have requested that Mike Daniels change the scrubber to ignore any files
owned by `nimbus' as a way to protect production processing.  I don't know
whether he has implemented that yet.  (My guess is that he's too busy with
the new Sparc 1000.)

If you do have to reprocess any of the flights, how about trying it using the
`nimbus' logon.  That will verify that Chris transferred everything correctly.

Krista,

Please make sure you log on as `nimbus' this time.  If you need the password,
see Chris or me.  I don't think Mike has yet fixed the scrubber, so be sure
to `touch' your files regularly until they are ready for archiving.  Also,
I recommend that you process all the flights (except your two "specials")
using the same version of NIMBUS.  Otherwise it will be very difficult to
archive the processing software.  (Your specials may give me problems, too.)

----------

Regarding Broomfield's Kohl Elementary School Science Fair:  someone needs
to contact Ms. Marty Burton to let her know you are interested in judging.
If you want, I can call her, or you may.  She's on lunch break at Kohl
(466-5944) between 12:45 and 1:20 p.m.  Her home phone is 465-0356.  Please
let me know.

I'm sure we will have a one-hour organization meeting some morning during the
week of 21 February.  Preliminary judging will take place at some agreeable
time on either 26 or 27 February.  Final judging will take place on 28 February
when we will discuss individual projects with the students; that will take most
of the day (8:30-4:00).

Krista,

In general, data archiving and distribution is my (RDP's) job.  As RAF's
Data Manager I oversee the data processing, but normally the processing
itself is the job of each project leader.

In many respects we work together to make sure that the data set meets the
requirements of the PI as well as our own standards.  One example of this
is to make sure that all the "standard" variables are output (at their
correct rates) to the netCDF file.  That will assure that we won't have to
reprocess data later because something was inadvertently omitted.

So, for this specific example, are you doing high-rate processing or
using a skeleton program to produce something special?  (In other words,
why aren't we shipping them copies of our already-archived 4-270 data set?)

We should be archiving any new data sets you produce.

Let's get together and talk about your plans.

Just wanted to notify you that I've received a formal request for data
from the SPICE project.  Pertinent info is as follows:

Request from:  Ms. Paz Ramos-Johnson
               TASC
               55 Walkers Brook Drive
               Reading, MA 01867-3297
               (617)942-2000

She has requested high-rate data for the 8 research flights in Florida
for the following quantities:  humidity, latitude and longitude, aircraft
true heading and true airspeed, FSSP cloud droplet concentration, static
air temperature, and equivalent potential air temperature.  Ms. Ramos-
Johnson is also asking that the data be output for them in ASCII format.

Unless I hear differently from you, I will begin processing the necessary
data.  I will then place the ASCII files in one of our directories where
Ms. Ramos-Johnson can then grab the data using ftp.

Let me know if you have any further questions.

Fantastic!  Thanks for yours and Brenda's help on this.  I will call
Ms. Ramos-Johnson momentarily here and inform her of the data format.

I have two more requests to make of you, Ron.  First, can you prepare
a brief document describing the netCDF format that I can send to Ms.
Ramos-Johnson?  Also, how should I tell her to get hold of the data?
Will it be possible for her to get it via ftp, or should I check with her
to see if they are set up to read Exabyte?

Also, I agree that the data set and support files should be archived to
the Mass Store.  Good idea.

I just spoke with Ms. Ramos-Johnson from TASC, and it will be easier
for her to get the data via ftp.  So, can you figure out the steps
she will need to go through to do this and let me know?  I will then
include the instructions to her in the letter I send with the netCDF
info.

Also, you told me once that there is a company she can contact to get
some help with reading the data.  Can you let me know what that company
is?  Thanks!

Krista

Ron,

I finished the nimbus files. They are all in the staticdata directory.
I might not be coming in on Wednesday, but I will be in on Friday.
I guess Krista can take a look at them and then let me know on Friday
if they are all allright. 

thanks,

Brenda

Brenda,

I submitted 3 requests for data with the 3 shortest files.  They, again,
will be put in my MIGS directory.  I'll send you email messages when they
have fully transferred.  In the meantime, here are the names they will
have.  Please don't transfer them until they have been completely
transferred from the Mass Store.
     /home/local/migs/ron/R0765.ADS  (RF02)
     /home/local/migs/ron/R0773.ADS  (RF09)
     /home/local/migs/ron/R0775.ADS  (RF11)

(Oops.  I just remembered that she only wanted RF01-RF09, so ignore/delete
the last file in the list and only work with RF02 and RF09.)

Krista,

Brenda sent me an email telling me that she has finished your special
high-rate processing for 4-270 (RF01-RF08).  I checked the headers to
make sure that all the data sets had high-rate data in them.
(They did.)

Now I guess it's up to you to verify that all the data are OK so we can
ship them off.

I think this data set (and its support files) should be archived to the
Mass Store.  Do you agree?

Krista,

Since this request is rather non-standard, I'm glad you are doing the
processing.  I would recommend:
  1)  Make a "complete" high-rate netCDF file if you can.  This can then
       be archived to keep you from having to process the data over again.
  2)  Check with Ms. Ramos-Johnson to see if there are any other variables
       that may interest her (particularly winds).  It is easier to give
       here more than she needs now than have her come back with a request
       for `missing' data later.
  3)  Strip off the variables of interest from the "complete" netCDF file
       for the ASCII conversion.

The ASCII files may end up to be quite large since you are writing high-rate
output.  Our normal place for files to be picked up via ftp is in chinook's
`~ftp/pub' directory.  This is not accessible from most workstations, so
you'll need to login to chinook to gain access.  Advise if you have any
write permission problems.

There is also a public area on the machine `ftp.ucar.edu' that has a one-day
purge cycle.  One can upload files for someone else to pick up.  Files are
guaranteed to stay 24 hours, but not necessarily longer.  (This is an option
if disk space on chinook is at a premium.)

You may need more disk space for output files than exists , so you may
benefit from doing a few flights, archiving and copying, then processing
a few more.

Please let me know if you need any help.

Below is a copy of the file (/home/local/proj/270/Production/stage/tapes.270)
which summarizes the raw ADS data tapes used for this project.  You may use
copies of the actual ExaByte tapes to do the processing, or you may get the
bitfiles from the SCD Mass Store System (MSS) using the script I wrote
(details below) and have NIMBUS read the data from a disk file.

When you do the processing, please put the output data in the directory
/home/local/staticdata.  The output file-naming convention is 270RFxx.cdf,
where xx is the flight number (note the upper- and lower-case letters).

The script `msgetads' can be used to retrieve raw ADS data files from the MSS.
The transfer rate, at present, is about 100 Mbytes per hour, so you can see
that it will take some time to transfer one of the larger files.  It will be
put in your MIGS directory (/home/local/migs/martinez), so when you run NIMBUS,
you will have to change its default path so it will know where to find the
file.

The disk space on MIGS isn't very large, so you may want to move the ADS files
to the directory `/home/local/ADSdata.'  When you use the `mv' command, you
should be logged in to either chinook or mistral; otherwise, the `mv' command,
executed locally, will move all the data through your local workstation (i.e.,
from chinook to workstation to mistral) across the net, and it will take much
longer.

Using the `msgetads' script is easy.  For this project, all you need to do
is enter the command:
   msgetads rxxxx
     where xxxx is the tape number
     example:  msgetads r0764

The script will answer with the following:
    /home/local/scripts/msgetads -- get raw aircraft data file from
     the SCD Mass Store System (MSS)
      Revision  2  RLR  940412
    Report bugs or give questions about MSS bitfile names to Ron Ruth
        (ron@raf.atd.ucar.edu)
 
 
   Ready to retrieve /RAF/1994/270/RF01/R0764 from the MSS.
    File size = 83817600 bytes.
   Do you wish to submit the MIGS request now ? (y/n/q) ([r]=y)

At this point, if you just hit the [RETURN] key, the job will be sent to
MIGS, and the file should appear in your MIGS directory in about an hour.

When you process a flight, please make a note of any messages that appear
in the gray area of the NIMBUS processor's window.  You may want to keep
a log file of your progress, which flights you've completed and which you
still have to do.

As we discussed today, please come see me on Friday, and we'll get started.

Brenda,

Can you tell me the full name of the setup file that Krista had you load
into NIMBUS before you processed all those flights for her.

I'd like to archive that file along with the data.

Thanks.

P.S.  If there are other files pertinent to the processing, I'd like to 
       know about them, too.

Ron,

The name of the file is /home/chinook/krista/prjsetup.nimbus

The only other files you might want are in my home directory in the      
directory nim_mess. These are only those messages that you asked me
to store in a file. There is a file for each flight. 
I guess if you don't need them then let me know and I will erase the
directory. 

Thanks,
Brenda

Project Update: Lawson-4-270

11/10
	First research mission was flown yesterday with Lawson and Baumgardner
on board oservers. All instrumentation was operational except for the optical
liquid water probe which needed the diode laser replaced. Excellent research
flight, 2.1 hours. All sensors functioned very well. We had a number of
excellent penetrations of growing Cu, LWCs near 1 gm-3. All six temperature
sensors agreed within .5 degrees, except for Ophir. Ophir tracks perfectly
but the cal needs changing for situation here. Strong positive buoyancy in
some of the clouds with Egg and Ophir showing no signs of wetting but ATB
showed cooling spikes.

We got good high rate data from Droplet Spacing Monitor and Fast FSSP and
will need many hours of analysis to interpret.

Today was called down to allow repair of Optical Liquid Water Probe and
we expect to fly tommorrow.

Test Flight Hours: 	.9
Ferry Flight Hours: 	6.5

Test Flight - 0.9 hours

Ferry Flight - 3.6+2.9 = 6.5 hours


Research Flight 1 - Summary

Research Hours = 2.1 hours	Total Flight Hours =  9.5 Hours Remaining = 33.5

Instrument Status:
Non-Functioning - OLWP	   - Not installed
		  FFSSP	   - Dirty optics and misalignment
		  HVPS	   - Problems with interface, HVPS did not interface
			     with the 2D interface as advertised.
		  OPHIR    - The cal cycle is being invoked every 50 seconds.

Flight summary:
	Multiple pentrations through Cu formed over land.
	One good pass through adiabatic core.
	Multiple passes through several other Cu already in later stages of
        formation or decay.



Research Flight 2 - Summary

Research Hours = 1.6 hours	Total Flight Hours = 11.1 Hours Remaining = 31.9

Non-Functioning - FFSSP	   - Intermittent problem with sizing
		  HVPS	   - Problems with interface, HVPS did not interface
			     with the 2D interface as advertised.
		  OPHIR    - Nimbus processing is introducing oscillations.
		  2D-C     - Moved to Bombrack but left turned off because of
                             runaway problem. Repaired after flight.
		  Forward Video did not record for some reason.


Flight summary:
	Multiple pentrations through Cu imbedded in stratus deck. Worked mostly
over Palm beach and north area.

Research Flight 3 - Summary

Research Hours = 3.3 hours	Total Flight Hours = 14.4 Hours Remaining = 28.6

Non-Functioning - FFSSP	   - Intermittent problem with sizing
		  HVPS	   - Problems with interface, HVPS did not interface
			     with the 2D interface as advertised.
		  OPHIR    - Nimbus processing is introducing oscillations.

Processing Notes:

The 2D-C is now on the inboard left pylon. There is apparently 30 Hz noise
being seen on egg temperatures and on ADIFR. This was seen in the spectra
analysis.

Flight summary:

  Worked marine cumulus east of Miami. Started with a line of cumulus oriented
along the wind. Began 100 feet below cloud base and stepped up in 200 ft
increments after each pass. Cloud bases were rising during the passes so
we increased increments to get into cloud just above cloud base. Heavy drizzle
and rain was encountered during many of the low level passes. Upper level
wind shear was causing precip to fall out of the upper portions of cloud
into clear air portions between the clouds. 

Research Flight 4 - Summary
Research Hours = 1.6 hours	Total Flight Hours = 16.0 Hours Remaining = 27.0

Non-Functioning - HVPS	   - Problems with interface, HVPS did not interface
			     with the 2D interface as advertised.
		  OPHIR    - Nimbus processing is introducing oscillations.
		  ADS      - System crashed repeatedly.

Processing Notes:

The tape header was overwritten during a reboot. Data may not be recoverable. The
FFSSP and DSM functioned normally as did SPEC OLWP and DHIS. The RAF FSSP #9 is
now in the right bombrack.

Flight summary:

   Midafternoon flight north to Lake Ochechobee. Multiple time lockups on
WINDS caused by ADS funky times caused abortion of flight. A few penetrations
through young cumulus.


Research Flight 5 - Summary

Research Hours = 2.0 hours	Total Flight Hours = 18.0 Hours Remaining = 25.0

MalFunctioning -  HVPS	   - Problems with interface, HVPS did not interface
			     with the 2D interface as advertised.
		  OPHIR    - Nimbus processing is introducing oscillations.
		  ADS      - System crashed after about an hour. Post flight
                             check showed that digital bus connectors were
                             very dirty and were probably causing the
                             intermittencies.
                  PSFDC    - Failure during roll maneuvers, probably caused by
                             digital bus problems.
                  DPB/DPT  - Differences because of dirty optics
                  FSSP_IBR - Noise in channels 2 and 12. Traced to digital bus
                             problem.
                  CONCF_IBR- All concentrations and liquid water calculations are
                             0 but counts are there.
		  DSM      - The laptop computer wouldn't come up running so
                             the DSM processor could not be initialized.



Flight summary:

	Late morning flight to Lake Okechobee. Boundary layer clouds were
persitent and there was a very strong haze layer right at LCL where there are
clouds forming. Flight track started right at cloud base then 500 meters higher.
FSSP showed classic condensational growth of droplets.

Ron--

I realized this morning that I had failed to notify you of a couple
of data requests that have come in for SPICE (Proj. 4-270) data.  One
is from people at New Mexico Tech., and I have already sent them part
of the data that they requested.  I am presently gearing up to get
the second portion of processing done for them, but I wanted to contact
you to see how you wish to handle this.  Do you want me to do the
processing, and simply notify you of to whom the data was sent and the
nature of the request, or do you want to handle the processing?

Krista

Ron--

I have a favor to ask of you.  I've gotten swamped with MCR and lidar
work that I need to be working on.  I was wondering if, since you are
the data manager here, you would agree to completing the high-rate
processing for Ms. Ramos-Johnson at TASC.  I've gone ahead and made
a Nimbus setup file for processing the necessary variables, so all you
would have to do is generate the high-rate data and then uses Chris'
program to convert the necessary variables to ASCII format.  (I've
got a list of the variables she wants here in my office.)  This would
really save me a lot of valuable time if you could do this for me.
Thanks!

Krista

Brenda,

I'm having a problem archiving one of the high-rate 270 data files you
processed.  Each time I try to send the file, I get some kind of I/O
error.  I just checked the file using `ncplot,' and it quit plotting
the data toward the beginning of the file.  I suspect the file has been
corrupted somehow.  Depending on your schedule, I was wondering if you
would redo it for me.

Please let me know.

Thanks.

Krista,

I have been trying to archive RF03 and have been getting consistent I/O
errors.  I just used `ncplot' to check out the file, and it quit about
1/4 of the way through.  I'm sure the file is corrupt, so I have asked
Brenda to redo it.  As a result, this data set is not ready to send off
to Ms. Ramos-Johnson.

I'll keep you posted.

Krista,

Following is a document you may email to Ms. Ramos-Johnson (since I don't
have her email address.) regarding software for access to the netCDF files
we'll be sending her.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=   cut here   =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

                        RAF netCDF Information
                           rev. 5/94   RLR
 
The Research Aviation Facility (RAF) uses a custom-built Airborne Data
System (ADS) and ExaByte tapes to acquire its aircraft research data.
Processed output data sets (with values calculated in engineering units)
are created from these tapes using a software processor called NIMBUS.
Developed at RAF, NIMBUS can adjust automatically to the many and varied
research instrumentation configurations, and its windows interface makes
the software easy to use.

The NIMBUS output data format is Network Common Data Form (netCDF).  Access
to netCDF data is via a public-domain library of programs and subroutines
which provide common C and FORTRAN interfaces for storing and retrieving
scientific data from disk files.  The NIMBUS netCDF files you receive, if
on tape, first must be stored onto a disk before they can be accessed.

The netCDF software library, as well as documentation and consulting
support, can be obtained from the Unidata project office of UCAR.
If you have access to Mosaic, extensive information is available from
the Unidata Mosaic server.  (Select "NCAR," "Unidata," netCDF.")
If you have access to an Internet gopher, the same information is
available from the Unidata gopher server.  (Select "Colorado," "Unidata
Program Center.")  In the "Unidata Software Distributions/netCDF
distribution (netcdf)" section, the complete netCDF library is the
file "netcdf.tar.Z."  The same file can be acquired via anonymous ftp
from `unidata.ucar.edu' in the `/pub/netcdf' directory.

The netCDF was developed at UCAR by the Unidata Program (sponsored by the
National Science Foundation) and employs concepts from the NASA-developed
Common Data Format.  Details of the netCDF can be found in the "NetCDF
User's Guide" (NCAR Technical Note, NCAR/TN-334+IA, NTIS # PB90 132275).
It is also part of the netCDF software distribution.

RAF recommends that you obtain netCDF software from Unidata and have your
system administrator (with help from Unidata consultants, if needed)
install it on your computer system.  Unidata support for netCDF may be
obtained through the Internet by sending email to `support@unidata.ncar.edu.'

RAF will develop a library of utilities for converting to/from other
formats and netCDF as time and programming resources permit.  If you have
questions, please contact the RAF Data Manager, Ronald L. Ruth, by phone
((303)497-1084) or Internet email (ruth@ncar.ucar.edu).

I was finally able to archive flight RF03 to the Mass Store System (MSS).
It turned out to be operator error (mine).  I had to tell the MSS that the
file was greater than 30Mbytes and forgot to do so.

But the file is now there along with the NIMBUS setup file you used.
Following is the present archived bitfile list for this project.  The
LRT path has bitfiles for the normal processing while the HRTS path
has Ms. Ramos-Johnson's bitfiles.  The files at the end are the raw
ADS tape images.

What is next?  Do you want RDP to make a tape (tar or binary) and send it

numbers and an email address would be nice, too.

Brenda,

I have now successfully archived 270RF03.cdf to the Mass Store.  It turns out
that the problem with it was mine.  I had to tell the MSS that it was larger
than 30Mbytes.  (All the others were smaller.)

The problem with plotting the data using `ncplot' was Chris Webster's.
I think he has fixed it, too.

Between the two of these errors, I thought that the netCDF data were bad.
Such is life!

Again, thanks for your help doing the processing.
