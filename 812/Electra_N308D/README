Notes to users of data for 1998-812 LakeICE and 1998-813 SNOWBAND projects:

These two projects used the same aircraft and shared the same overall time
period.  Because of this commonality, they used the same project set up at
RAF, and therefore, many files are shared by both projects.  The research
flights were consecutively numbered and did not differentiate between
projects.  Also, the netCDF data file headers reference project number
"812" and project name "LakeICE" irrespective of whether they were LakeICE
or SNOWBAND.  RF13, a flight to obtain calibration maneuvers, was common
to both projects.

To clarify:

A high-rate data set was produced only for the LakeICE project.

-------

Because all of the SCD Mass Store System (MSS) bitfiles for this project
originally were archived to the LakeICE directory (/RAF/1998/812), this README
file (common to both projects) serves as a pointer to the data and support
files used for this project.  For example, the archived production netCDF
data are kept in separate project directories (LakeICE in /RAF/1998/812
and SNOWBAND in /RAF/1998/813), but all the support files are kept in
the LakeICE directory.  (It is just impractical to move all the bitfiles
pertinent to the SNOWBAND directory.)  The raw ADS files are kept in the
LakeICE directory to avoid confusing the NIMBUS processor needed to produce
the production data sets.

Following is a list of MSS bitfiles pertinent to the SNOWBAND project that
reside in the LakeICE directory (/RAF/1998/812):

-------

For the RAF computer system at Jeffco, a UNIX hard link was made to equate the
project 812 directory with the project 813 directory.  (This cannot be done on
the MSS, since it does not support links.)

Shared files in project directory 812 or 813 that misrepresent project
813 SNOWBAND are:
   ProjectName 
   Production/proj.info

Shared files in project directory 812 or 813 that, perhaps, should be
linked with two names are:
   Production/812.tar.dir
   Production/MSCP_out.812
   Production/arch.812
   Production/arch_support.812
   Production/tarit.812
   Production/archive/tapes.812

Those who want to use the NIMBUS software to process data from the SNOWBAND
project need to reference Project 812, since that is the project number that
appears in the raw ADS data headers.
