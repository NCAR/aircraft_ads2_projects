Allen & Chris,
 
Since the SHEBA project has been assigned the project number 101, what do
you want to do with the files in the extant /home/local/proj/101 directory?
Are they of any value?

I have archived that directory in the files:
   mistral:  /home/local/proj/ADS_test_101.tar.gz
       MSS:  /RAF/1996/101/ADS_test_101.tar

The directory itself has been zapped and 101 is now ready for SHEBA!

The first of the weekly SHEBA project meetings will be held on Monday, 9
March 1998 at 9:00 a.m. in the RAF conference room.  All RAF staff
assigned to either one or both phases of this C-130 project should
attend.  I will present an overview of the preparation and deployment
schedule, and Linda and I will collaborate in the presentation of
various logistical and travel details.

While it is critical for RAF staff assigned to either of the two project
phases to attend, all interested RAF staff are welcome to come, also.

See you on the 9th!

SHEBA PIs and RAF staff participating in SHEBA,

During the FIRE-III/SHEBA meetings here in Boulder last week,
several people asked me if any further information was available
regarding survival training for those individuals who will be
flying on the C-130 during SHEBA.  Henry Boynton, the RAF Chief
of Flight Ops, has contacted Eielson Air Force Base, and he has
made preliminary arrangements for such training to be provided
to C-130 flight crew members.

While the exact details remain to be worked out, this survival
training has tentatively been scheduled for Monday, 4 May 1998
from 9:00-11:00 a.m.  The training will be held at Eielson Air
Force Base, and Henry's contact at Eielson will make the necessary
arrangements ahead of time to get all C-130 participants onto the
base and signed in.  I will forward on more information to you
all once the exact time and location have been finalized.

A couple of additional notes in regard to this training.  First,
for those SHEBA PIs and RAF staff members who will be flying on
the C-130 during the second (July 1998) deployment of the aircraft,
we will also be making arrangements for a second training course
to be held around 6 July.  Lastly, I wish to emphasize that *all*
individuals planning on flying on the C-130 during the SHEBA 
deployment should plan on participating in one of the survival
courses if at all possible.  Important information regarding
survival techniques and strategies will be provided that will
be invaluable to us all.

Please contact me if you have any questions.

Krista

All,

This message is actually intended for those RAF staff who will be
participating in SHEBA.  (Sorry for the broad dissemination, but it's
easier to use the staff email alias.)

It occurred to me that I forgot to mention the room rates for Sophie
Station and the Wedgewood Resort yesterday during the SHEBA meeting.
So, if you'll be staying at either of these hotels, here's the info
you'll need to fill out the "Lodging" portion of your TA forms:

Phase I (Sophie Station)
------------------------
30 April - 15 May -- $69/night
16 - 30 May -- $100/night

Phase II (Wedgewood Resort)
-------------------------------
$110/night all dates (5 July - 1 August)

SHEBA C-130 PIs and RAF SHEBA Participants:

The purpose of this email is to notify you all of a change in date for
the SHEBA Phase I survival training to be held at Eielson Air Force
Base.  Judy Curry notified me recently that the first C-130 research
flight will be conducted on Monday, 4 May, in order to overlap with some
of the other aircraft participating in FIRE-III/SHEBA.  Because of this,
and because of the fact that the C-130 will not be arriving in Fairbanks
until Saturday, 2 May, it became necessary to re-schedule the survival
training course.

This class will now be held on Tuesday, 5 May from 9:00-11:00 a.m. at
Eielson Air Force Base.  I will provide you all with more details
regarding the exact location at Eielson once I have more information.

As I mentioned earlier, this survival training course will be required
for RAF staff and instrument PIs who will be flying on the C-130 on a
regular basis.  For those PIs who will be arriving in Fairbanks after 5
May, it will only be important for you to receive a C-130 safety
briefing prior to going on a C-130 flight.

Also, for RAF staff and C-130 PIs participating in Phase II of SHEBA, an
additional survival training course will be set up at Eielson for a date
after the arrival of the C-130 in Fairbanks in July.

Let me know if you have any questions.

All,

I am pleased (relieved?) to be able to inform you all that the MCR is
now back on-line.  After all-out efforts from several people over the
past several days, we now have seven functioning channels, real-time
data display, a working portable data system, and the capability to
record active scan data in ASCII format.  So, tomorrow (Tues., 3/24),
John Cowan and I will leave for Los Alamos to begin characterization
and calibration of the instrument prior to SHEBA.

I owe an enormous thank you to John, Mike Spowart, and Dave McFarland.
Their willinginess to work some very long days got us to this point.
Also, my thanks to Chris Webster and Aref Nammari for their efforts
on this project as well.

I'll send more email updates from LANL once we're up and running down
there.

All,

Greetings from LANL.  John and I arrived here safely yesterday evening
at about 5:00 p.m. and just completed our first day of work with Pete
LaDelfe (our technical contact at LANL) and his colleagues.

Our first day here went extremely well.  The MCR and TADS (the portable
data system) both came on-line quickly and with no major problems.  The
instrument and the data system ran all day with no hitches or
problems......very stable.  I think our ability to bring our equipment
on-line so quickly actually caught Pete and his colleagues a bit off
guard.  They are still working to get their equipment set up and
functioning in order for us to begin the monochromator characterization
of the MCR's performance.  Based on how work progresses over the next
day or two, we may decide to instead begin working on the calibration of
channels 1-6 with the integrating sphere source while Pete and his
colleagues work on getting the remaining characterization equipment
ready.

The only small problem encountered today involved figuring out how to
hook up Pete's PC to lenado, the computer in TADS, so that Pete will be
able to download the MCR ASCII data.  After several phone calls to
Chris, Mike Spowart, and Mike Daniels, we were able to get Pete's PC to
"see" the TADS computer, so now we'll be able to transfer data to Pete
as needed.

So, it appears to me that we're all ready to go down here.  John and I
are looking forward to seeing how the MCR continues to respond over the
coming days as work on the calibration and characterization progresses.
>From a personal standpoint, I look forward to learning a lot from Pete
and his colleagues here at LANL.

More in a couple of days as work progresses.

All,

The calibration and characterization of the MCR is well underway here at LANL,
although we still have several days of work ahead of us.  Summarized below is
where the work stands at present:

1)  The absolute radiance calibration of channels 1-6 (using LANL's large
integrating sphere) is all but complete.  We need to finish up a couple of
measurement cycles once one of the lamp power supplies is repaired, and then
the next task will be to make some absolute radiance measurements with the
MCR scan mirror at +/- 45 degrees.  This latter set of measurements will
enable us to study the performance of the instrument at the edges of the
scan.  While all of the data (and trust me, it's a LOT of data) have not been
fully analyzed yet, our preliminary review of our results have indicated the
following good points:  a)  the calibration appears to be very linear (i.e.,
the voltages vary linearly with increases/decreases in spectral radiance),
and b) the MCR measurements of radiance are extremely stable over time.
(I believe the standard deviation of measurements of a constant radiance
value is far less than 1%.)

2)  Yesterday, we started on the characterization of the individual channels.
This work involves the use of a double spectrometer and a series of lenses and
mirrors to focus a (relatively) collimated beam of monochromatic light into
the receiving optics of the MCR.  The spectrometer beam is then scanned over
a broad wavelength range surrounding the central wavelength and bandwidth
of a particular channel's filter.  The response of the MCR is then recorded
and used to map out the spectral response of the channel.  Basically, these
measurements provide a way to verify/check the spectral curves provided by the
filter manufacturer.  We completed the study of channel 1 yesterday and will
continue on with channels 2-4 today.

3)  The work remaining to be done here includes the following:  a) absolute
radiance (blackbody) calibration and characterization of channel 7 (10.9 um),
b) the +/- 45 degree absolute radiance for channels 1-6 mentioned above, and
c) the cold temperature test of the instrument performance to examine the
stability of the calibration data at cold (flight-level) temperatures.

In terms of the schedule for getting the work done, it looks like this.
I will be returning to Jeffco tomorrow (4/1) to resume work on SHEBA C-130
preparations.  Dave McFarland will be arriving here in Los Alamos tomorrow to
begin taking over for John Cowan.  John and Dave will overlap for a day, and
John will return to Jeffco on Friday, 4/3.  John will then return to LANL
around 4/13 to relieve Dave.  Once I have completed some SHEBA and MCR tasks
at Jeffco, I will return to LANL around 4/16 or 4/17 to help John finish up
the work on the MCR and to bring the MCR home.

Some miscellaneous thoughts to date.  This is a very detailed process here,
involving the collection of a lot of data.  However, I am very happy with how
the MCR is performing at present, and I am also pleased with the results we
have obtained to date.  I have already learned a lot from our colleagues here
at Los Alamos, and their expertise and enthusiasm are proving invaluable to
the MCR development effort.

More news later, and I'll see some of you back at Jeffco tomorrow!

All RAF staff participating in SHEBA:

I just sent the following message out to the PIs participating in SHEBA and
thought that the same information would be useful to those of you who will
be working on the C-130 during SHEBA.

Please let me know if you have any questions on the following.

All,

Just wanted to follow up briefly on the message Joanne just sent out
about the TIAA-CREF general meeting on Monday, 13 April.  As Joanne
noted in her email, the weekly SHEBA meeting will take place in the
conference room immediately after the TIAA meeting.

I would like all RAF staff who will be participating in SHEBA (for
either Phase I or II, or both) to attend this meeting.  Joanne and I
will be going over various procedures and policies regarding time
sheets, phone call charges, etc., and I would like everyone to hear this
information at the same time so as to avoid questions once we are in the
field.

Thanks!

Krista

All,

I needed to pass on some new information regarding the schedule for work
on the C-130 over the next few days:

1)  The C-130 will be weighed this Friday, 4/17.  Thus, all
instrumentation to be flown for SHEBA must be installed in the aircraft
by the end of the day on Thursday, 4/16.

2)  Due to work that remains to be done on the aircraft, the test flight
schedule has been changed.  The C-130 will be pulled out of the hangar
on Monday, 4/20 to be washed.  At present, I am aiming to have the first
SHEBA test flight on Wednesday, 4/22.  Takeoff time, flight duration,
and flight path will be determined at a later date.

3)  I remind all C-130 PIs and RAF staff assigned to SHEBA that the
C-130 safety briefing will be held tomorrow, Wednesday, 4/15, at 1:00
p.m. in the RAF conference room.  Please attend.

4)  For RAF SHEBA staff:  For those of you who will be sending equipment
up to Fairbanks via air freight, remember that the shipment will leave
here on Monday, 4/20.  Thus, all of your equipment needs to be packed up
and labelled with packing lists completed by the end of day Friday,
4/17.  Please see me if you need packing labels and/or blank lists.

5)  The C-130 is still scheduled to depart for Fairbanks on Saturday, 2
May, and that's a firm date.  The first research flight for SHEBA will
take place on Monday, 4 May.

That's all for now,

Krista

All,

Thought I'd better pass on the latest and greatest schedule for C-130
work over the next few days.

Because snow has been forecast for this coming Monday (4/20), washing of
the aircraft has been postponed from Monday until Tuesday, 4/21.
Weighing of the aircraft has been re-scheduled for Monday, 4/20, so the
C-130 will now be available all day tomorrow (Friday, 4/17) for anyone
who may need to work on the aircraft.

In terms of the schedule for Monday, the weighing process and some other
tasks should be completed by around noon.  So, the C-130 will once again
become available for instrumentation work by 1:00 p.m.  The aircraft
will be flown to DIA for washing, so it will be unavailable all of
Tuesday, 4/21 and until about noon on Wednesday, 4/22.  Thus, I am now
planning to have the first test flight on Thursday, 4/23.  As you all
know, the C-130 must leave for Fairbanks on Saturday, 2 May.  Thus, I am
pushing extremely hard to have the first test flight completed by
Friday, 4/24.

The above schedule is, of course, subject to change at short notice due
to unforeseen weather changes.  I will keep everyone informed of any
changes as they come up.

Krista

All,

To quote a famous person (well, maybe not famous....I think it was Elmer
Fudd):

"Curses, foiled again!"

The C-130 was not washed at DIA yesterday (4/21) as requested.  The crew
responsible for this work has been instructed to wash the plane today,
but this means that the C-130 will not be back at Jeffco until late
tomorrow (Thurs., 4/23) morning.  Given the work that will have to be
done on the aircraft to get it ready for flight, I have had to postpone
the first test flight again.

I have re-scheduled the first test flight for Friday, 4/24 afternoon.
At present, I would like to plan on a 1:00 p.m. takeoff from Jeffco.
This first flight will probably not be very long (perhaps only one hour
or two), as the primary purpose will be to shake things out on the plane
in an effort to identify major and minor installation and operating
problems.

Krista

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Length: 1958
Status: OR

All,

Just a few notes in regard to the C-130 schedule for this final week
before the aircraft leaves for Alaska:

1)  For the next two days (27 and 28 April), the top priority of RAF
staff working on the C-130 will be the performance of RAF sensor
calibrations and the addressing of various problems that were discovered
during last Friday's test flight.  Power will be available on the C-130
on both of these days, so PIs needing to work on their instruments may
do so.  Because of this work schedule, I have tentatively scheduled the
next test flight for Wednesday, 29 April in the afternoon.  More on the
takeoff time later after I determine how work progresses over the next
day or so.  Also, I presently anticipate that two more test flights may
be necessary, so tentatively plan on these flights being done on 29 and
30 April.  A total of 2.6 hours were flown last Friday, leaving us with
7.4 test hours.

2)  The C-130 will depart for Fairbanks, AK on Saturday, 2 May.  Takeoff
time will be 8:00 a.m., so all PIs planning on flying on the C-130 up to
Alaska must be at Jeffco by 7:00 a.m. at the latest in order to load
their luggage on the plane.  The flight to Fort Wainwright will be
direct (no stops), and it is anticipated that the C-130 will arrive at
Fort Wainwright by 2:00 or 2:30 p.m. local time.  The first C-130
research flight will be on Monday, 4 May, and Sunday, 3 May will be
dedicated to unloading gear from the aircraft and getting it prepped for
Monday's flight.

3)  Mike Daniels and I will be leaving for Alaska this Thursday, 30
April in order to arrive before the plane and get various logistical
arrangements in place, get the RAF computers set up, etc.  While I am
unavailable on Thursday, 30 April and Friday, 1 May, questions regarding
C-130 test flights and other Jeffco SHEBA matters should be addressed to
either Darrel Baumgardner or Dick Friesen.

That's all for now.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Krista

All,

Due to a need for RAF staff to concentrate on fixing some important
sensor problems, today's (Wed., 4/29) test flight has been cancelled.
This flight has been re-scheduled for tomorrow (Thurs., 4/30) for 1:00
p.m.

I will be leaving the office in about two hours to head home and pack
for my departure, so please email the following information to Darrel in
preparation for tomorrow's flight:

1)  Number of people in your group that will need seats;
2)  Any wishes you have in terms of flight plan objectives.

That's all for now.  Good luck to you all on the remaining C-130
preparations, and I'll see everyone up in Fairbanks on Saturday!

Mike,

Dick gave me a copy of an email from Krista requesting that a high-density
ExaByte drive be ripped off of `mistral' and sent up with the EC-130Q.  Can
you not use a spare drive that exists (I am told) for the aircraft (or is
there no spare drive for the aircraft)?

Which of the two drives should I remove, the 8500 (tall) or 8505 (short)?

I understand that, to remove a drive, one must shut down and power off the
entire computer system.  Can I do that with "sudo?"  (How can I find out
which superuser commands I'm allowed to perform with "sudo?")

If I remove a drive, I guess the weekly backup will be done over a period
of a few days, since each must be done sequentially instead of in parallel.

Dick told me that the drive doesn't have to go with the EC-130Q and can,
instead, be shipped separately, so I await your answers to the above
questions.

All,

   Greetings from Fairbanks, where over the course of the last four days,
we've experienced everything from sunny clear skies to pouring rain followed
by some snow.  Alaska in the spring, I guess.
   The C-130 arrived here safely on Saturday, 2 May at about 7:00 p.m. local
time.  Yesterday (3 May) was spent addressing a problem with one of the
aircraft engines and chasing down a few sensor problems that cropped up during
the ferry flight up.  The C-130 was declared ready for its first research
mission yesterday afternoon.
   So, at 9:30 this morning (4 May), the aircraft departed on its first
research flight with 19 people (including RAF staff) on board.  The C-130 has
landed at Fairbanks INternational to fuel and, hopefully by now, is on its
way north.  The plan for today is primarily to perform cloud radar surveys and
make microphysical measurements in the clouds surrounding the SHEBA ice ship.
A supplemental mission for today is to try to help locate a tethered balloon
with instrumentation attached that got loose from the ship a couple of days
ago.  The hope is that the bright orange balloon might be visible from the
C-130 as the aircraft flies over.  An 8 to 10 hour mission is anticipated for
today.
   I have given Dick Friesen the list of Fort Wainwright phone and fax numbers
at which RAF project management folks can be reached.  I will also email back
(shortly) phone numbers for the techs and mechs.  These numbers will all be on
a list posted over Jason's desk up front.  As a further note, I have also been
provided with a cellular phone by NASA.  NASA has asked that this phone only
be used for emergency phone calls, so if you can't reach me at Sophie Station
or at either of the two Wainwright office numbers, here's the cell phone
number:   (907)378-4575
   That's all for now.  More news later after we perform our first mission
and have digested some of the data.

All,

Greetings again from the north.  Following is a brief summary of
events up here at Fort Wainwright during our first week of supporting
the C-130 for Judy Curry during SHEBA.

Research flights flown:  2 (RF01 and RF02)
Research hours flown to date:  18.2
Research hours remaining:  130.7

RF01 and RF02 were flown on 5/4/98 and 5/7/98, respectively.


RF01 SUMMARY
------------

A number of instrumentation problems were encountered during this
flight, some of which were attributable to the extremely cold
temperatures encountered during ferry to and from the ice ship and
to the extended amount of time spent flying in cloud once on site
over the sea ice.  Briefly:

1)  Icing on the tips of the 1-D PMS probes was significant, with
the exception being the PCASP.  (The latter is equipped with a more 
powerful heater.)  Even though radome de-ice wasn't active on the
radome, icing of this section of the plane was not a problem, and
the collected wind data for RF01 are of good quality.

2)  The data system froze up and dropped out several minutes after the
24:00 GMT rollover.  The system was brought back up, but failed again
several minutes later.  The source of this problem is still unknown,
and Chris Webster is presently looking for possible causes.

3)  A number of MCR operational problems were encountered because
of the cold.  Data collection from the instrument was inconsistent
throughout the flight due to the fact that the motor control unit
in the right wing pod environmental box got too cold and could not
adequately control the scan motor rate.  Possibly unrelated to the
cold was the fact that the right door motor on the MCR jammed in-flight 
and burned out.  Post-flight solutions to the above problems included
the following:  a) insulating the inside of the environmental box
and some of the MCR covers; b) blocking off the ram air jet flow
into the environmental box and removing the fan in the box; c)
replacing the right door motor.

Other MCR problems that remain to be solved include the noise in
channels 2,3,5, and 7.  The noise in channels 5 and 7 is believed to
be microphonic in nature, and that in channels 2 and 3 is believed to
be due to 60-cycle noise contamination.  At present, the above four
channels are largely unusable due to the level of the noise.  Mike
Spowart and John Cowan are still exploring possible solutions.

4)  The down-looking IR hemispheric radiometer did not work properly
during the flight.  Bill Irwin cleaned the contact of all of the
down-looking radiometers after the flight and was able to remove a
significant amount of grime.  This has appeared to fix the problem,
and IRB is now working fine.

5)  RSTB (the first Heimann radiometer) exhibited a significant offset
from RSTB1, although both instruments track well.  This would appear
to be a calibration problem.  However, data collected from RSTB were
also more noisy than those from RSTB1.  The source of this noise has
not been isolated, and the problem is also intermittent.

6)  RICE (the icing indicator) was not operational during this flight.
Post-flight testing revealed that the sensor was dead.


RFO2 SUMMARY
------------

Significantly fewer instrumentation problems were encountered during
this flight, although the following did occur:

1)  The data system again quit several minutes after the 24:00 GMT
rollover.  As indicated above, Chris Webster is presently working on
finding an explanation and solution for this problem.

2)  The MCR performed much better during this flight, although data
from channels 2,3,5 and 7 are still largely unusable due to noise.  The
data from channels 1, 4, and 6 do, however, to be of very good quality.
My first look at channel 1 has revealed some extremely good quality
sea ice and cloud top images, with very fine resolution in all.  The
MCR stopped working approximately 1.5 hours from landing.  Post-flight
analysis has us believing that this may be due to the control box near
the scan head getting too cold.  Insulation will be added to this unit
today, and heating wiring will be put around the scan motor unit in an
effort to also keep it functioning properly.  Unfortunately, the right
door again jammed at the end of the flight, and it is possible that another
door motor has been toasted.  Mike Spowart and John are presently trying
to figure out why this problem keeps occurring, and no definite solution
has yet been found.  We are discussing contingency plans to try and
prevent the possibility of continually burning up door motors.

3)  Enya, one of the WINDS displays in the aft section of the cabin, would
not come up before or during the flight.  Mike Daniels fixed it today,
however, so it should now again be usable.

4)  RICE was still not functioning during this flight.  A spare was
shipped from Jeffco; however, Bill Irwin has determined that the unit
sent is also bad.  Another unit will now be shipped from Jeffco and
will hopefully arrive in a couple of days.

5)  SWT (the up-looking shortwave radiometer) yielded questionable data
during the flight.  Bill Irwin will today work on cleaning the contacts on
all of the up-looking radiometers, and if this does not fix the problem
with SWT, the sensor itself will be replaced.


That's a brief look at what's been going on here for the past several
days.  Overall, RF02 was much more successful (from an RAF instrumentation
standpoint) than was RF01.  Useful data were obtained over the sea ice
during RF01, however, and we were able to learn from the cold temperature
experience and address a number of problems prior to RF02.  In general,
all of the PIs appear to be happy with how their various instruments are
performing.  The AIMR support team is working on fixing a problem with
not being able to scan at higher rates at low altitudes and are also
working to fix the 90GHz channel which failed during RF02.  The Valero
radiometers, SPEC CPI, Hudson CCN/CN equipment, Hallett cloudscope, and
Rogers CFD all appear to be working very well.

The next research flight is presently scheduled for Monday, 11 May.
Other activities for the coming week include the arrival of the ER-2 on
13 May and an open house for Army members and their families and other
local folks.

That's all for now.

All,

As I'm sure many of you are aware, we are still working on ironing
out a few MCR problems up here in Alaska.  While noise remains an
issue in channels 2, 3, 5, and 7, I am happy to report that channels
1, 4, and 6 have, to date, yielded extremely good data.  I spent
almost all of yesterday looking over MCR data from research flight 2
(flown on 7 May 1998), and I am very pleased with the results I'm
seeing for the above three channels.

I have just finished setting up a Web site on which I intend to post
preliminary, "quick look" MCR images from here in the field at SHEBA.
I encourage each of you to take a look at it at your leisure so that
you can get an idea of the type of data we're collecting with the MCR.
The URL for this site is as follows:

http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/~krista/shebamcr.html

Given the volume of work and data analysis to be done here, I'm not
yet sure how frequently I'll be able to update this page with new images.
However, I am hoping to be able to put up a couple of new images within
a day or two of each research flight.

Let me know what your thoughts are after you've had a chance to take a
look!

Krista

P.S.  While not exactly of interest from a research standpoint, the
data collected from channel 1 during the ferry flight up to Fairbanks
are incredible.  Some wonderful mappings of the Canadian coastline near
Vancouver island and some wonderful views of glaciers and mountains
in Alaska.

A number of additional web sites are now available for viewing different aspects
of the SHEBA project.

	(I have not yet put this on the SHEBA site for wider distribution
	 until RAF staff has a chance to view and comment on the
	 accuracy and appropriateness of this method for
	 documenting sensor mounting)

For those of you that are interested in the Science, you can view the
presentation I made at the last Science Team meeting. The presentation
was on analysis of cloud layer profiles made during the first two
research flights. Judy Curry said these were  text book cases of
Arctic Stratus that should be put in text books that described
the "ideal" stratus condition. A modeler could not have done a
better job of paramaterizing this case than nature has already done.

I will continue to update the participants web site as more photos are
made. There are some obvious omissions that I will soon rectify.

The RAF digital camera is being put to good use.

All,

   We're now slightly over halfway done with Phase I of the EC-130Q deployment
in support of SHEBA.  Here's a look at the flight hours picture as of this
writing:
     Research flights flown:  4 (RF01, 02, 03, and 04)
     Research hours flown to date:  36.5
     Research hours remaining:  112.4
   I forgot to point out in my last summar report that Judy has asked that all
of the research hours for both phases of the project be lumped together (along
with the remaining test hours not used at Jeffco) into one big pot.  That's
why the "Research Hours Remaining" number above looks rather large.
   The EC-130Q is still up flying RF05 as I write this.  The ER-2 also was
up today on its first mission and is due back about any minute now.  I was
reminded of the WB-57F while watching the ER-2 take off this morning.  It
also uses very little runway and all but heads straight up once it's off
the ground.  Quite a sight.
   The largest "battle" (if you want to call it that) fought here over the
past several days involved work to eliminate microphonic noise from MCR
channels 5 and 7.  Mike Spowart and John Cowan spent a few very long days
trying to eliminate the problem.  The MCR was not flown on the EC-130Q on RF03,
and once a potential solution to the problem was found and implemented on
channel 7, the MCR was re-installed for RF04.  Unfortunately, the solution
(putting in place a type of grounding wire on the BNC connector for channel 7)
did not hold for the duration of RF04.  While post-flight analysis of channel
7 data showed that the fix seemed to work (i.e., mostly useable data were
obtained) for about the first 45 minutes of the flight, the noise returned
for the duration of the flight.  Thus, the MCR is now flying with only
channels 1,4, and 6 clear of noise and useable.  The presumed 60-cycle
noise in channels 2 and 3 has been eliminated, but the overall noise level
(due to the high gains) in these two channels still has me questioning how
useful those two channels are, at present.  Depending on the flight schedule
this week, we may attempt one final grounding solution for channels 5 and 7.
Past that, significant work to fully address the problem will have to wait
until the EC-130Q and MCR return to Jeffco in early June.
   One other small issue that came up over the past few days involved the
discovery that aircraft motion was, in some instances, interfering with the
quality of the wind data on the EC-130Q.  Most notably, the problem exists in
the vertical wind data.  Dick Friesen and others caught this problem and have
worked out some offsets that can be added into the processing algorithms to
remove the unwanted effects.  I will get this implemented as soon as I can
tomorrow.  My thanks to Dick and others back at Jeffco for spotting this
problem in the first place and for helping us to find a solution.
   Outlined briefly below are some additional problems that were encountered
during RF03 and RF04:


RF03, 5/11/98 
-------------
1)  As was noted above, the MCR was not flown on the EC-130Q for this flight.  
2)  While RSTB and RSTB1 continued to track well, the offset between the
     two variable values was still present.  Also, RSTB continued to exhibit
     slightly more noise when observing cold temperature surfaces than
     did RSTB1.  Bill Irwin cleaned the optics on both Heimann radiometers
     post-flight, and this appeared to solve part of the problem of the
     noise in RSTB.  The offset between the two instruments is, I believe,
     attributable to cal. coeff. differences, and I will ask that both
     instruments be re-calibrated and tested completely in June prior
     to Phase II of SHEBA.
   Other than the above two problems, the RAF-supported instrumentation worked
well during this flight.  This mission's purpose was to primarily make
microphysical measurements in a cloud layer over the ice ship, and all of
the RAF PMS probes (1D and 2D) functioned extremely well.


RF04, 5/15/98
-------------
1)  As noted above, MCR channels 5 and 7 still displayed microphonic noise
     during this flight.
2)  An offset of as much as 5 degrees C was still present between RSTB and
      RSTB1.
3)  SWT and UVB both failed in flight.  It was determined post-flight that
     UVB had accidentally been left disconnected prior to the flight while the
     down-looking radiometers were being worked on.  It was re-connected and
     should have been OKaduring today's flight.  SWT was replaced with a new
     sensor and was calibrated.  It should be noted that, while work was being
     done on the hemispheric radiometers over the past few days, some problems
     with the wiring and connectors were discovered.  These problems will need
     to be addressed in June once the aircraft is back at Jeffco.

   That's about all for now.  The EC-130Q PIs still continue to be, for the
most part, happy with how their instruments are performing.
   One additional note:  I have recently added some new MCR images (obtained
during RF04) to the Web site I emailed everyone about a few days ago.  If
you're interested in what we're getting from channels 1, 4, and 6, here's
the URL for the site again:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/~krista/shebamcr.html
   On a non-research note, we're all noticing that, to our dismay, the
mosquitos are starting to make their presence known here.  They still move
pretty slowly (maybe because of the cold), but I must say that they're some
of the biggest specimens I've seen in a while.  So, if you're going to be up
here in July, be sure you pack the Cutters!

That's all for now,

Krista

All,

   We are now in the final days of Phase I of SHEBA.  The present plan
is to fly the final Phase I research mission tomorrow (Wed. 5/27).  Under
this schedule, the EC-130Q will be packed up Thursday, moved to Fairbanks
International Thursday evening, and we will depart for Jeffco on Friday
5/29.  Note that we have just amended our departure time from here for
Friday morning.  We are now scheduled to depart Fairbanks INt'l at 7:00 a.m.
This should have us landing at Jeffco at 5:30 p.m. Mountain Time.
   Following is the flight hours summary as of this writing:
     Research flights flown:  7 (RF01-07)
     Research hours flown to date:  64.6
     Research hours remaining:  79.4
   Further efforts were made by John Cowan over the past few days to try to
eliminate some (if not all) of the noise in MCR channels 5 and 7.  This effort
primarily involved putting different types of coax connectors on the output
cables of the channel 4-7 dewars in an effort to better ground the dewar
outputs.  This last fix was implemented prior to RF07 (flown on 5/25/98).
Unfortunately, this change did not fix the noise problem in channels 5 and 7,
so this issue will have to be addressed in June once the EC-130Q and MCR are
back at Jeffco.  Norm Zrubek is also presently working with Steve Rauenbuhler
in DFS to put together vibration isolators for the MCR scan head.  It is hoped
that this modification will help to eliminate the microphonic noise we've been
battling in some of the MCR channels.  This modification should be completed
prior to the departure of the EC-130Q on 5 July for Phase II of SHEBA.
Several other possible fixes are also presently being considered for
implementation in June.
   Following are some brief comments on specific problems encountered
during RF05, 06, and 07:

RF05, 5/18/98
-------------
1)  DPB oscillated throughout flight.  Both dewpoint sensors (DPT and DPB)
     were cleaned post-flight, and DPB performed well during RF06.
2)  Noise still present in MCR channels 2, 3, 5, and 7.  Channels 1, 4, and 6
     worked very well.

RF06, 5/20/98
-------------
1)  In general, all RAF sensors performed extremely well during this flight.
     The only problem related to continued noise in MCR channels 2, 3, 5
     and 7.

RF07, 5/24/98
-------------
1)  Once again, all RAF sensors performed very well.  Again, noise in
     MCR channels 2, 3, 5, and 7 was the only significant problem noted.
     Channels 1, 4, and 6 worked very well.

   So, that's about it.  Bob Curran of NASA will be arriving here in Fairbanks
this coming THursday, 5/28 for a somewhat major scientific review to be held
Thursday afternoon.  All of the PIs here are starting to get geared up for
that and will likely be tied up with that event for most of the afternoon
on Thursday.
   One final note.  I wanted to give a big thanks to all of the RAF staff
who have been working here in the field during Phase I and who have been
supporting us back at Jeffco while we've been gone.  The field crew here
has put in some very long days to keep the plane flying and to keep the
RAF-supported sensors in top operating condition.  They have also been putting
in a lot of effort to help out the various EC-130Q PIs as needed.  My thanks
to everyone here and back at Jeffco for all of their hard work.  The result
has been that Judy Curry is extremely pleased with the quality of the data set
she has so far obtained and has been very happy with the level of support she
has received from RAF staff attached to the aircraft.  Let's hope that Phase
II goes just as well in July.
   That's all for now.  See you back at Jeffco this Friday!

   I thought everyone might be interested in this  NASA Press Release
RE:  FIRE/ACE and SHEBA.  (Not much mention of SHEBA...mostly just
discussion about FIRE/ACE.)
   Also, Dan Rather will be doing a report on SHEBA on the CBS evening news
tonight (WEd., 5/27), and I believe also tomorrow night (Thurs., 5/28).  The
news will be broadcast here in Fairbanks at 6:30 p.m., so I guess that would
be 5:30 p.m. back in Colorado.  My understanding is that there is no mention
of the EC-130Q but good coverage of what's been going on on the ship.
   One last item.  NASA hired a video photographer to go on one of the EC-130Q
flights a couple of weeks ago.  I guess that the footage he shot is very good.
I have asked Dave McDougal to send me two copies of the VHS tapes of this at
Jeffco.  These will be available for viewing back in Colorado I imagine within
the next few weeks.

All,

Just to let those of you know who've been pulling files from Marley here in
Fairbanks ...

Marley will be shut down in approximately one hour (12:15 p.m. local time,
2:15 p.m. your time).  I've backed up /home/local/proj/101 and am in the
process of backing up RF01-08 netCDF files to tape (even though I believe
there are copies of all files already on mistral:/home/data).

So, that's about it from here.  The EC-130Q will depart Wainwright at
2:00 p.m. today to be moved to Fairbanks International, and we're still
planning to depart Int'l at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow (maybe a few minutes
earlier if we can speed up fuelling the plane).

Jason and Dick F. -- Henry and Lowell will be patching a call through to
Jeffco somewhere while we're en route to update you guys on our arrival time.
So, be on the lookout for that.

See you all soon! 

Krista

All staff who supported Phase I of SHEBA:

Per an agreement I made with Joanne and the travel office
several weeks ago, we will need to submit all of the travel
vouchers for Phase I of SHEBA at the same time and to the same
person in travel.

I would like to schedule a meeting for this week for all RAF
staff who went on Phase I so that we can briefly sit down
together and make sure we all have the same information on 
per diems, hotel rates, etc.  Making sure that we all use 
the same figures should help insure that our vouchers make it
through travel in an expedient fashion.

Would it work for Phase I folks to have this meeting on Wed.,
6/3 at 9:00 a.m. in the conference room?  Let me know.

Also, if you have already turned in your travel to Jason, I
will ask him to bring all completed vouchers with him to this
meeting and to hold off on submitting all travel vouchers until
they are all in.

My apologies for sending this to all RAF staff, but it's the fastest way
for me to get the word out to all RAF staff involved in Phase I of
SHEBA.

I would like to revise the time slightly for the Phase I travel meeting
tomorrow (Wed., 6/3).  The RMC will be held from 8:30-10:30 a.m.
tomorrow, and while most of us involved with Phase I won't need to be at
that meeting, I still thought it best to re-schedule.  So, I'd like to
have the Phase I travel meeting in the conference room at 11:00 a.m.
tomorrow, 6/3.

Let me know if this poses a problem for anyone.

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Length: 1258
Status: OR

All,

Phase I of SHEBA was, in the opinion of Judy Curry and those of us
supporting the aircraft, largely a success.  Judy's view is that the
data set collected in the first phase of the project surpassed her
expectations.  However, we also encountered some data system,
instrumentation, and MCR problems that must be addressed during June,
prior to the aircraft's return to Fairbanks on 5 July.

In order for us to develop a consensus of what work needs to be done
this month, I would like to have a Phase I C-130 and MCR review this
week.  It is critical to have the meeting this week so that we can put
together a thorough outline of what tasks need to be tackled and can
then proceed with the work in an expedient fashion.

I would like to have this meeting on Wednesday, 3 June at 1:00 p.m. in
the RAF conference room.  All RAF staff--including those who
participated in Phase I, will participate in Phase II, and those who are
simply interested--are highly encouraged to attend.  If you participated
in Phase I, I ask you to spend some time prior to this meeting to
prepare your own list of what you see as tasks that must be completed
(either on the aircraft or on instrumentation) prior to Phase II in
July.

Thanks.  See you on Wednesday.

Krista

All,

For those of you who participated in Phase I of SHEBA, you'll recall that NASA
hired a video photographer to go on one of the research flights.  I received
today two copies of VHS video tapes containing the footage taken by the
photographer.

If you've been on a nine-hour research flight over sea ice and want to re-live
the experience, or if you've yet to go on such a flight and want to see
what it's like ahead of time, feel free to borrow one of the tapes from me.
Courtesy of full sound recording on the tapes, you can even experience the
sounds of prop noise inside the cabin.  Heck, you can (via viewing) even
participate in one of the pre-flight meetings!

Seriously, there is some very good footage of the C-130, the sea ice, and the
research ship.  I took a quick look a little while ago, and the video quality
is very good.

PIs and RAF Staff Participating in Phase II of SHEBA:

Greetings all!  Just wanted to pass on a few pieces of information regarding
the deployment of the C-130 for Phase II of SHEBA:

1)  As most (if not all) of you know, RAF staff have been working on several
  sensors in order to get some minor problems fixed prior to Phase II.
  Thus, one (maybe two) test flights will be necessary prior to the C-130's
  departure in July.  At the earliest, the first of these test flights will
  be done this Thursday, 18 June.  If you are a PI who will participating in
  Phase II and you have removed any of your equipment, please make sure that
  either your equipment is back on the plane or that your equipment is in
  flight-ready condition by Thursday morning *at the latest*.  I will update
  everyone within the next couple of days as to the likelihood of a flight
  actually happening this Thursday.
2)  The C-130 will depart for Fairbanks on Sunday, 5 July.  Takeoff time from
  Jeffco Airport will be 10:00 a.m.  If you are travelling on the C-130 (all
  RAF staff supporting Phase II and some PIs), please note that you must be at
  Jeffco by 9:00 a.m. at the latest on 5 July to load your gear and get ready
  to go.
3)  Lunches for the ferry flight on 5 July.  Yep, Jason and I (okay, primarily
  Jason) are working on putting this together again through the Safeway in
  Broomfield.  We will get another lunch menu prepared and distributed this
  week, and I ask anyone travelling on the C-130 to return your completed menu
  to Jason by Friday, 26 June at the latest so he can place the orders well in
  advance of the July 4th holiday weekend.
4)  Based on recent conversations with officials at Fort Wainwright, it now
  appears that they are going to reverse their earlier stance and decide that
  we can't fuel the aircraft at Wainwright in July.  So, it looks like we'll
  be doing the same hop to fuel at Fairbanks International that was necessary
  in May.
5)  One last item:  I'll be on vacation and out of email and phone contact
  from 22-26 June (just can't get a good modem connection for the laptop while
  backpacking).  I'll be back in the office on Monday, 29 June.  Should you
  have any questions regarding SHEBA while I'm gone, please contact Allen
  Schanot here at the RAF.  His email address is schanot@ucar.edu, and his
  phone number is 497-1063.

That's all for now.  Let me know if you have any questions on the above.

Subject: MCR Status Update -- 10 June 1998
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Length: 3507
Status: OR

All,

   As I'm sure most (if not all) of you are aware, the deployment of the MCR
on the C-130 for Phase I of SHEBA yielded both good results and some problems.
Channel 1, 4, and 6 performed extremely well throughout May.  However,
channels 2, 3, 5, and 7 were plagued by noise problems.  As soon as the
aircraft returned to Jeffco at the end of the first phase, Mike Spowart,
George Nicoll, Aref Nammari, Norm Zrubek, and Steve Rauenbuhler (DFS) started
work on the MCR to solve the remaining noise problems.  This email gives you
all a brief summary of where things now stand with the MCR following about
eight days of work.
   The primary focus of efforts for the past several days has been to try to
eliminate the microphonic noise from channels 5 and 7.  It was verified that
the noise in the two channels' signals was, in fact, microphonic in nature by
"shaking" the instrument using a shake table constructed out here at the RAF.
While all of the dewar channels (4-7) display microphonic noise at a high
enough magnitude of shaking, it is channels 5 and 7 that are particularly
susceptible on the C-130.  Apparently, these two channels are very sensitive
to the 68 Hz vibration produced by the aircraft props.
   After the shake testing was completed, a set of vibration isolators was
installed between the MCR baseplate and the mount rails in the wing pod.
A full engine runup was performed late this morning here at Jeffco to examine
the results of this modification.  Unfortunately, the noise in channels 5 and
7 has not been eliminated.  The level of noise in channel 5 remains about the
same as was observed during Phase I.  However, it appears that the level of
noise in channel 7 has been reduced.  It is my opinion that, at present, data
from channel 5 still will be unusable and that data from channel 7 may be
usable.  (I would like to look at some test flight data before giving a more
confident opinion on channel 7.)
   So, where things stand now, RAF technical and engineering staff are trying
to think of other possible ideas for isolating the channel 5 and 7 dewars from
vibration.  One possibility being explored is to wrap the dewars with rubber
in an effort to cushion them further from vibration.  We will all simply
have to see what develops with these efforts over the next several days.  The
limiting factor here is, of course, the need to have the MCR back on the C-130
and ready to go by the time the aircraft departs for SHEBA Phase II on 5 July.
   In terms of channels 2 and 3, some ideas are being considered for possibly
reducing the noise levels in the channels and making the data usable.  I can't
really say more about those efforts until work has been allowed to progress
for the next few days.
   So, as of this writing, I feel I must warn everyone that it is possible
that the microphonic noise will still be affecting MCR channels 5 and 7
during Phase II of SHEBA.  While the RAF will make every effort to figure
out possible solutions to this problem, I do not want to mislead anyone into
thinking that the problem will have gone away by 5 July.  Should we still have
noise problems in the various MCR channels following the completion of SHEBA,
it will be a top priority for those of us on the MCR development team to come
up with a plan of attack and hopefully solve these problems prior to INDOEX.
   All for now.  Please contact me if you have any questions.

All,

Okay, given that I've only been back in the office for a little over an hour
and have already been inundated with questions about a potential EC-130Q test
flight, I guess I'd better address that up front.

Yes, I do want to see another test flight done prior to the departure of
the EC-130Q for Alaska this coming Sunday.  This is how I presently see the
schedule.  Given that Thursday and Friday are holidays, I would like Wednesday
to be set aside for final preparations (loading, last minute adjustments)
of the aircraft.  Thus, it seems best to me to schedule a test flight for
Tuesday, 30 June.  This flight is needed primarily to check out the MCR once
it is re-installed.  (Several fixes have been made over the past several
days.)  Let's plan on this flight being done late tomorrow morning or in the
early afternoon, depending on when the MCR is re-installed and ready to go
and/or what bearing the temperature may have on things.  More later on the
exact time once I see how work on the MCR progresses.

I would like to have a brief meeting this afternoon (Mon., 29 June) of all
staff who have been working on the EC-130Q and MCR for SHEBA and/or will be
going into the field for Phase II on Sunday.  This will help me to get back up
to speed on what all was done last week while I was on vacation and will allow
me to pass on some final details regarding travel, etc.  This meeting will be
at 1:00 p.m. in the conference room.

Please attend.

Krista

All,

There will be one more test flight prior to the departure of the EC-130Q
for AK on Sunday, 5 July.  This test flight will be done tomorrow, Tuesday,
30 June, in the late morning or early afternoon.  The primary purpose of this
flight will be to check out the MCR (several fixes have been made over the
past several days), so the exact time of takeoff for the flight will be
determined by when the MCR, and other PI instrumentation, are ready to go.
If at all possible, I would like to ask that everyone (both RAF staff and
instrument PIs) have their equipment in a flight-ready state by 10:30 a.m.
The test flight will be short (on the order of 1.5 hours).

NCAR will be closed on Thursday and Friday of this week for the July 4th
holiday.  Thus, Wednesday will be needed to pack up the EC-130Q and prepare
it for departure over the weekend.  If you would like to ship anything (other
than personal luggage) on the aircraft, please notify me ASAP and let me know
the weight.  Your items will then need to be here at the RAF by the end of day
tomorrow (6/30) in order to be loaded on the aircraft Wednesday (7/1).

The EC-130Q will depart for Fairbanks on Sunday, 5 July.  Takeoff time has
been set for 10:00 a.m., so *at the latest* those people travelling on the
EC-130Q must be at the RAF by 9:00 a.m.  The takeoff time of 10 will be
strictly observed, and you don't want to be left behind!  Also, note that
because of expected high temperatures, it will be necessary for us to take on
less fuel here at Jeffco on Sunday.  Thus, it is anticipated that we will need
to make one fuelling stop along the way, probably in Seattle.  We presently
anticipate landing at Fort Wainwright between 4 and 5 p.m. on Sunday.

Finally, Monday, 6 July, will be needed to prep the aircraft and install
the Valero radiometers.  Thus, the first possible day for Phase II research
flights will be Tuesday, 7 July.

That's all for now.  Let me know if you have any questions on the above
information.

just in case we're able to move up the takeoff time.

As I think everybody knows, tomorrow (Wed., 7/1) will be used to pack up
the C-130 and get it ready to depart for AK on Sunday.  I was just
speaking with Ed R., and we came up with what we think will be a good
schedule for tomorrow.

Let's plan on using the morning tomorrow to pack up our gear and get
everything that needs to go on the aircraft staged in the hangar.  I've
already started to pile some stuff that needs to go on the plane by the
hangar door, near the nose of the Electra.  Packing of the plane will
start after lunch at 1:00 p.m.  This should give us time to get
everything done prior to the long holiday weekend.

Let me know if you have any questions.

All,

The final test flight prior to our departure for Phase II of SHEBA was flown
this afternoon (6/30/98).  One of the primary purposes of this flight was
to check out the performance of the MCR.  As most (if not all) of you will
recall, a signifcant amount of work was done on the MCR over the past few
weeks after the instrument returned on the EC-130Q from Phase I of SHEBA.
The primary focus of these efforts was to eliminate the microphonic noise
from channels 5 and 7 and to eliminate the noise from channels 2 and 3.

After several days of effort, it was determined that nothing could be done
prior to Phase II of SHEBA to remove the microphonic noise from channel 5.
It is now apparent that we (the RAF) will likely need to ship the dewar
containing this channel's filter back to the manufacturer after SHEBA and
have the dewar "swapped out" for a model that is more suitable for being
flown in a high-vibration environment such as is encountered on the EC-130Q.
We did, however, send the channel 7 (10.9 um) dewar back to the manufacturer
(EOS) at EOS's suggestion.  The dewar was "re-baked" and some of the
electronics were re-worked in an effort to reduce, if not eliminate, the
microphonic noise level.  In regard to channels 2 and 3, Mike Spowart, George
Nicoll, and Aref Nammari came up with the idea of moving the amplifiers for
the two channels' output signals closer to the detectors.  This was done with
the intent of reducing the "antenna length" of the wires between the detectors
and the control box in an effort to lessen the influence of noise in the
output signals.  This worked beautifully, and the signals from channels 2 and
3 are now totally clear of noise contamination.

Channel 7 was examined during today's test flight, and I am happy to report
that, while a small level of microphonic noise is still present, the channel
7 output is now definitely useable.  We obtained some great data this
afternoon showing thermal mappings of farm fields, lakes, and other features
east of Greeley.

During today's flight, we encountered a small problem with the channel 4
(1.06 um) signal.  It railed at a positive voltage for part of the flight
but has not exhibited the same behavior on the ground, nor did it do this
for all of the flight.  So, we're going to leave it "as is" and will monitor
the channel's performance in the field.

So, it now seems that the MCR will return to Alaska with six out of seven
channels operational--great news to me, and I hope to everyone else.  We
(the RAF) will be putting our heads together in August once we've completed
our support of SHEBA to map out where we want to go from here in terms of
further work on the instrument to get it 100% operational for INDOEX, but,
for now, I think we're ready to go for Phase II of SHEBA, and I'm extremely
hopeful that we'll be able to collect even more varied spectral data for Judy
Curry and her colleagues in July.

Many thanks to Mike Spowart, George Nicoll, Aref Nammari, John Cowan, and
everyone else at the RAF who pitched in over the past few weeks to get the
MCR to its present status prior to the July deployment for SHEBA.

Let me know if you have any questions on the above.

Krista,

Mike plugged me into the problems you are having with the ExaByte drives
and cleaning tapes.  Sorry they are giving you trouble.  Here's what I know:

The new Exabyte cleaning tapes (one cannot get the older ones any more, and
we don't have any of them left.) will not reset the "clean me" light on 8500
series drives unless a firmware upgrade is installed.  A couple months ago
Dick Taylor took the firmware upgrade tapes which I borrowed from Bob Rilling
and installed the upgrade in all the on-board drives.  I'm not sure if he
possibly skipped one somewhere, and you are now using it.  It's also possible
that the upgrade didn't install properly for some reason.

The blinking light will not alter performance of the drive, but you obviously
won't know when next to clean it.  Since these new cleaning tapes are quite
expensive, one doesn't want to clean the drive if it is not needed.  Bob is
now out of town on an ATD project and won't be back for quite awhile, so I'm
not sure whether I can borrow the appropriate firmware upgrade tape and get
it to you somehow.  (If Jean Hurst knows its location, I probably can.)

Also, I don't know whether Mike offered you a substitute drive.

Please let Mike or me know what you need.

Hi Ron,

Actually, the info you've offered below provides quite a bit of
insight.  Aref and I were starting to wonder if there wasn't something
we were missing, because the drive with the flashing lights has been
recording just fine since we first detected the problem.  So, we're
just going to keep flying with it until something catastrophic happens
with it (which hopefully won't even happen).

It is a pain that we won't know exactly when it needs to be cleaned.
However, it's been our experience in the field that the drives typically
need to be cleaned after about three flights or so.  I'll ask the techs
to follow that schedule and will ask them to simply clean the drives
every couple of flights (despite the lights blinking all the time).

Thanks again for your insights on this!  Guess we should make sure that
the firmware gets installed on this one drive after we get back, as I
am now pretty certain that that's what's causing this problem we're
having.

All,

I'm sure that by now, all of you are probably in the loop regarding the state
of affairs up here in Fairbanks.  Nevertheless, I thought I'd go ahead and
proceed with sending out a weekly status update from SHEBA.

As I write this, the EC-130Q is still at Kulis Air Force Base in Anchorage
undergoing engine work.  I spoke with Henry Boynton last night, and they (Kim
Brandon, Ed Ringleman, Henry, Mike Heiting, Aref Nammari, and John Cowan)
finished installing the replacement engine yesterday.  However, the engine
failed to start during a run-up test, and it was determined that the starter
is bad.  So, today, the mechanics are going to work to locate needed parts at
Kulis, and Henry and Mike are going to simultaneously work on getting the old
engine packed up and shipped back to Jeffco.  I'll know more about the status
of the EC-130Q and its anticipated return date and time to Fairbanks when
I hear from Henry later on today.  For those of us who remained here in
Fairbanks, the past few days gave us an unexpected short vacation.  (What
a concept on a field project:  we actually got the weekend off!)  However,
I think we're all looking forward to getting the aircraft back and getting
research flights underway again.  And the SHEBA PIs are also anxiously
awaiting our return to action.  There was a long break between when the UW
Convair flew over the sea ice to map albedo and when the EC-130Q arrived back
in Fairbanks to take over this task, and this latest engine problem has only
made that gap longer.  As was noted during RF09 flown last week, the ice has
broken up considerably since the end of May, and much more albedo mapping
remains to be done to fully characterize this.

As alluded to above, only one research flight (RF09, flown on 7/8/98) has been
flown as of this writing.  The flight hours summary is as follows:

---------------------------------------------
Research hours flown as of this writing:  9.9
Research hours remaining:  66.3
---------------------------------------------

Despite our past week of inactivity, Judy Curry is still planning on executing
seven more research flights before the project wraps up at the end of July.

In general, all instrumentation performed well during RF09.  A brief summary
of problems detected is given below:

1)  Channel 4 MCR data no good due to improper dewar gain setting and a
   problem with a chip on the post-amp board.  Channel 5 and 6 data are also
   questionable due to improper dewar gain settings.  Following RF09, the gain
   switches on the dewars housing channels 4, 5, and 6 were set in the proper
   positions.  Work must still be done to fix the chip problem for channel 4.

2)  The UV hygrometer data were bad during the flight.  Bruce Gandrud has been
   made aware of this and is presently looking for the possible problem.

3)  The PLWC sensor appeared to be bad during the flight.  The techs ran out
   of time to fully investigate this issue before the EC-130Q had to be flown
   to Anchorage, so we are not yet sure what caused the sensor to fail.  This
   will be examined after the aircraft returns to Fairbanks.

4)  Some spiking in the RSTB1 data was detected during post-flight analysis of
   the data.  I am not yet sure of the source of this spiking; however, it is
   not serious enough to make the data unusable.

Other than the above problems, the RAF sensors performed well.  Also, all of
the PIs seemed pleased with how their instruments performed.

So, that's where things stand at present.  During our day off last Saturday,
several of us drove to Denali National Park and took a bus tour into the park.
Not a great weather day, but we were able to catch a quick glimpse of the
north peak of Denali and of the middle section of the south peak.  And it was
an outstanding day from a wildlife viewing standpoint.  We saw five Toklat
grizzlies (including a mother and two cubs who ambled across the road in
front of the bus), several caribou (two of whom trotted by the bus and even
agreed to pose for pictures), a moose, and several Dall's sheep plus lots of
ptarmigans.  If you want to check out some pictures from the trip, check out
one of Darrel's Web sites at:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/~darrel/denali/

That's all for now.  Please feel free to email me should you have any questions on the above.

A question I just received from Dick Friesen reminded me of a point I forgot
to mention in the status report I just emailed out.

Judy Curry does NOT intend to request an extension to the EC-130Q deployment
time period up here in Fairbanks.  The primary reasons are logistical and
financial.  There would be too many arrangements to make, and neither Judy
nor NASA have the funds to extend past the end of July.  Also, additional
funds would have to be found to keep the EC-130Q support crew here in
Fairbanks.  Added to all of this is the fact that, since we're in the
midst of the tourist season here, we probably wouldn't even be able to
find accommodations for any of us to stay here in August.

So, we will aim to fly seven more missions and will depart Fairbanks as was
originally scheduled at the end of July.  At present, it is possible that we
could be flying a mission as late as Thursday, 30 July.  In that situation, we
will pack up on Friday, 31 July and return to Colorado on Saturday, 1 August.

All,

I just heard from Henry in Anchorage, and the new engine three on the
EC-130Q is now fully operational.  The crew in Anchorage will return here to
Fairbanks tonight with the aircraft in preparation for a possible research
mission tomorrow, 7/15.

So, we're back on-line.

All,

Up here in Fairbanks, we're a little over a week away from wrapping up the
EC-130Q deployment for SHEBA and heading home to (much warmer) Colorado.
However, as of this writing, four research flights remain.  So, I think it's
safe to assume that we'll be pretty busy here in the last few remaining days.

Following is the present flight hours status:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Research hours flown to date during Phase II (RF09-RF12) -- 41.1
  ** Note that the total of 41.1 also includes the short flights
     of the EC-130Q to and from Anchorage for the engine repair work**
Research hours remaining -- 45.1
  ** The total of 45.1 above includes the additional 10 hours that
     have been made available to the project by ATD**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The hunt continues here for a good boundary layer cloud case.  The first three
research flights of Phase II involved alto-cumulus studies (not listed in
the SHEBA study objectives), and yesterday's mission involved the study of
a persistent fog layer extending from the surface up to about 100 meters.
The possible flight scheduled for today was scrubbed, and we will now fly
tomorrow.  The remaining three flights will be carried out between Saturday,
25 July and Thursday, 30 July.  At present, it is planned that the EC-130Q
will return to Jeffco at the latest on Friday, 31 July.

Outlined below are brief summaries of problems encountered during the first
four research flights:

RF09, 7/8/98 
------------
1)  MCR Channel 4 data no good;
2)  PLWC data questionable; sensor appeared to be bad;
3)  UV hygrometer data no good;
4)  Some spiking/noise apparent in RSTB1 data.

RF10, 7/15/98
-------------
1)  UV hygrometer data bad--instrument failure in flight;
2)  No FSSP-100 data--problem fixed post-flight;
3)  UVB data questionable--periodic dropouts in signal;
4)  PLWC data still questionable--waiting on parts from Jeffco to repair
     sensor;
5)  PCASP data questionable during ferry leg back to Fairbanks--pump problem
     discovered and repaired post-flight;
6)  MCR channel 4 data again questionable--periodic dropouts in return signal.

RF11, 7/18/98
-------------
1)  Continuing problem with dropouts in MCR channel 4 signal--chips on
     post-amp board replaced post-flight;
2)  PLWC data still bad;
3)  No UV hygrometer data--instrument turned off;
4)  Persisting dropouts in UVB data.

RF12, 7/21/98
-------------
1)  Cryogenic dewpoint hygrometer failed in flight--data bad;
2)  No UV hygrometer data--instrument removed pre-flight for repair;
3)  ATWH, PLWCC1, UVT, IRT, and SWT data all extremely noisy periodically--
     suspect noise/interference problem in common aft DSM;
4)  260X data questionable--alignment needed;
5)  Persisting dropouts in UVB data;
6)  No CPI data--instrument removed pre-flight for data system repair.

Other than the handful of problems outlined above, most of the RAF sensors
are performing very well.  And, I'm happy to report, during RF12 yesterday,
all seven channels of the MCR worked beautifully.  I haven't yet had the
opportunity to comb through the data but will do so today and attempt to get
some more images up on my SHEBA MCR Web site.

So, that's all for now.  We've been treated to some rainy days and some nice,
temperate sunny ones.  (Maybe I shouldn't rub that in too much, given what
everyone back in Colorado has been subjected to, weather-wise.)  Today we're
also being treated to the background aroma of smoke due to a forest fire that
must be burning somewhere nearby.

Please feel free to email me should you have any questions on the above.

All,

Since my last writing, we've gotten two more research flights under our belts
up here in Fairbanks.  Two more remain before we wrap things up at the end of
this week and head home on Friday 31 July.

Following is the present flight hours status:

----------------------------------------------------
Research hours flown to date (RF09-RF14) -- 61.3
Research hours remaining -- 24.9
----------------------------------------------------

We will definitely be flying tomorrow (Tues., 7/28), and the last flight will
be done on either Wednesday or Thursday.

Given below are brief summaries of problems encountered during research
flights 13 and 14:

RF13, 7/23/98
---------------
1)  Cryogenic hygrometer data no good; problem persisted through RF14.
2)  Bottom dewpoint hygrometer data bad for first five hours of flight--
     problem cleared up in flight.  Suspected moisture problem in flight.
     Both dewpoint sensors inspected and cleaned post-flight.
3)  "Stubby" Lyman-Alpha data no good; sensor replaced post-flight.
4)  No FSSP-100 data during flight.
5)  260X data questionable during flight--alignment needed and done
     post-flight.
6)  PLWC data no good.
7)  UVB data intermittent; sensor replaced post-flight.
8)  No PCASP data; determined post-flight that pump motor had failed.

RF14, 7/26/98
---------------
1)  Cryogenic hygrometer data no good; presently working on trying to isolate
     and solve the problem.
2)  "Stubby" Lyman-Alpha data still no good; different sensor put in
     post-flight.
3)  Radome iced up briefly in flight; problem solved with de-icing.  Radome
     lines checked and cleaned post-flight.
4)  No PCASP data--probe removed before flight.
5)  Left wing pod temperature data flaky--suspect bad Omega controller.

Other than the above problems, we seem to be in very good shape going into the
final two flights.

Dr. Serafin arrived here late last night and will be visiting the project
until this Thursday, when he will head back to Boulder.  His plans include
accompanying us on the research flight planned for tomorrow.

That's all for now, and this will be the final EC-130Q status report I will
send from Fairbanks.  Let me know if you have any questions on the above,
and we'll see some of you soon back at Jeffco!

Hmm, that subject line sounds a bit like a bad science fiction movie or
something ...

At any rate, I just wanted to let everyone back at Jeffco know what's going on
with the EC-130Q schedule for the next couple of days.  The aircraft and crew
took off at 9:00 a.m. local time here for the last research flight over the
SHEBA ice ship.  I anticipate them being back by around 8:00 p.m. tonight.

Tomorrow (Thurs., 7/30) will be spent packing up the aircraft and the
equipment to be sent back to Colorado via air freight.  The EC-130Q will be
ferried over to Fairbanks International at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow and will be
fuelled at that time.

We will depart Fairbanks International at 6:00 a.m. (or sooner if possible) on
Friday, 7/31.  Henry and Mike H. presently anticipate that the flight time to
Jeffco will be 8 hours.  This will have us landing at Jeffco at around 4:00
p.m. on Friday.  As was done in May, I will have Henry or Mike patch through
a call to the RAF when we are a couple of hours out in order to update Jason
with a more exact ETA.

The air freight equipment shipment will be picked up by Lynden Air Freight
tomorrow at 4:00 p.m. and is due for delivery at Jeffco on Thursday, 6 August
by 3:00 p.m.

One last thing.  The computers here in our office (Marley and Dhow) will be
powered down either this evening or tomorrow morning.  Thus, if you want to
get any files from Marley over the net, I suggest you do it during the day
today.  After about 5:00 p.m. tomorrow (7/30), we will no longer be using
the offices here at Wainwright.  Should you need to reach any of the RAF
crew members after that time, please call either of the two hotels.

That's all for now.  Please email me should you have any questions on the
above.

Ron,

I wanted to check in with you on a couple of items related to the
archiving of the SHEBA data tapes.

First, the set of tapes from Phase II of the project now (no surprise
here) need to be added to the pile of SHEBA tapes to be archived.  Any
word yet on whether or not the bandwidth/file size problem has been
resolved so that all of the SHEBA tapes (from both phases) can be
archived?  Also, note that we are now recording two data tapes
simultaneously on the C-130.  So, we already have a ready-made set of
copies in hand.  This dual recording was only done during Phase II, so
if you haven't done so already, you'll still need to make copies of the
tapes from Phase I.  At any rate, we'll only need to archive one of the
sets of tapes for Phase II.

Second (and as I alluded to above), have you had a chance yet to finish
copying the tapes from Phase I?

Please advise me as soon as possible as to how you wish to proceed with
the archiving.  Even though we're close to having duplicate copies of
all of the tapes, I'll still feel more comfortable when we have the ADS
images up on the Mass Store.

Thanks.

Krista

Krista,

I copied the Phase I tapes and archived them (in segments) to the SCD Mass
Store System (MSS).  (They are only the complete ADS images and not the split
files that Chris' software was to generate (separate files for MCR, SDI and
PMS-2D.  That still needs to be done.)  This was finished by 9 July 1998.
You can view the current MSS archive summary in the file:
     /home/local/proj/101/Production/archive/tp2ms.summary

The tape list can be found in the file:
     /home/local/proj/101/Production/archive/tapes.101

If you have a log from Phase II, I will add it to this file.  I can start
archiving the data whenever you get them to me.

All,

Just a reminder that the Post-SHEBA Early Data Review Meeting will be held
this coming Monday, 10 August in the FL-2 auditorium.  All interested RAF
staff are welcome and invited to attend.

The meeting will start at 8:00 a.m., with the morning session (lasting until
12:15 p.m.) primarily focusing on presentations dealing with data collected
on the EC-130Q.  The afternoon session will include additional EC-130Q
data presentations as well as discussions of ship data and data management
issues.

I will post an agenda for the meeting up by the mailboxes by approximately
2:30 this afternoon, for those interested.

Julie,

Nice signature!

I was greatly upset when the tapes arrived at Jeffco this afternoon; seven
(7) of the eleven (11) tapes (R1275, R1277, R1279, R1283, R1285, R1287 and
R1295) were "write enabled" (red flags pushed back--ERASE ON).

  THIS IS A TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE SITUATION!

Before I sent them to ML for staging, I specifically checked each one to
make sure that their "write enable" tabs were set to "read only" (red flags
exposed--ERASE OFF).

The policy when Sue Jensen was the tape librarian (and I would hope it is
still in place) is that the status of a 1/2" tape write-ring or 8mm tape
write-enable tab is not altered.  If a job calls for a write request and
the requested tape is "write protected," the operator drops the job and
informs the requestor of the reason.  Has this changed?

(Another minor gripe is that the inserts were missing from all but three
of the cases.  From now on I'll make sure I don't include them.)

These are master data tapes that cannot be duplicated, and I don't want their
contents put in jeopardy by having them inadvertently write enabled.  With
that in mind, would you please look into this situation and let me know what
you find out?  

Thanks a bunch; I really appreciate it.

Subject: SHEBA PMS 2D Data Files

Content-Length: 640
Status: OR

Ron,

As Phase I of the SHEBA data processing, I have started working on
stripping off the 2D data from each of the data tapes.  This is
(obviously) creating a bunch of 2D data files, presently being stored in
/home/data.  I would like it if you could archive these up to the Mass
Store for me.

My plan is to process/strip off the 2D data in groups of four flights
per group.  (I'm trying to avoid filling up the entire /home/data
partition.)  I'll do a little bit of QC work on the 2D files, and then
I'll let you know when they're ready to go up to the Mass Store.

Let me know if you have any questions on the above.  Thanks!

Krista

Ron,

The first group of SHEBA PMS 2D files is ready to go up to the Mass
Store for archival.

These files are all in /home/data on Mistral and are for flights
RF01-RF04.  The names are as follows:

101rf01a.2D
101rf01b.2D
101rf01c.2D
101rf02a.2D
101rf02b.2D
101rf03.2D
101rf04a.2D
101rf04b.2D

I have changed the permissions on each of the files so that each is read
only for all groups, users, etc.

FYI, I have gzipped the ADS images for flights RF01-RF04 and have stored
them in /home/staticdata.  I would these ADS images to left in
staticdata, as I will need them shortly for the processing and QC of the
netCDF data.

Thanks for your help, and let me know if you have any questions.

Krista

Krista,

The above files have been archived to the SCD Mass Store System.
I also archived the following sripped ADS-SDI images:
101rf01a.ads  -->  /RAF/1998/101/ADS/RF01A
101rf01b.ads  -->  /RAF/1998/101/ADS/RF01B
101rf01c.ads  -->  /RAF/1998/101/ADS/RF01C
101rf02a.ads  -->  /RAF/1998/101/ADS/RF02A
101rf02b.ads  -->  /RAF/1998/101/ADS/RF02B
101rf03.ads   -->  /RAF/1998/101/ADS/RF03

I'm in the process of archiving the remaining two this morning.
101rf04a.ads  -->  /RAF/1998/101/ADS/RF04A
101rf04b.ads  -->  /RAF/1998/101/ADS/RF04B

I cannot remember whether you want to keep these files on the system, so
I'll not remove them until you are back from vacation.

Hi Ron,

Thanks for your help on this.  Also, you've come up with a great idea in terms
of also archiving the ADS images.  I think it's going to be a lot easier and
faster to pull the ADS images (rather than the entire tape images) down from
the Mass Store to use for processing when needed.

I've just started working with the next set of four flights (RF05-RF08), and
I'll let you know when the next set of ADS images and 2D files are ready to go
up to the MSS.

Krista

Julie,

Just a short note to see if you received my email message from 19 August 1998
and to ask if you had a chance to investigate how RAF's 8mm tapes got write
enabled.  I am a bit antsy about sending any new master tapes up there until
this situation is resolved.  If you think someone else at SCD should pursue
this, please let me know.

Thanks.

Julie,

I guess my terminology is a bit arcane.  When these tapes were sent, I used
the email message (shown below) that included the word "staging" which, to
us old-timers, implies "reading."  From now on I'll include explicit wording
about "read only" and, if you think it prudent, also explain the correct
position of the red tab on an 8mm tape.

Thanks for your comments.  They will help us all in the long term.  :)

Ron ,

The best way to inform everyone that these tape are read only tapes,
would be to include a message in the email that you send when you 
inform us that tapes are arriving.  Tell us that the tape should be
in write protect only.


Thanks,

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Length: 844
Status: OR

Ron,

Okay, the next group of SHEBA 2D and ADS files are ready for archival on
the MSS.  These files are for flights RF05-RF08.  I've changed the group
name on both types of files to "proj," and the permissions are set the
way you wanted them the last time.

The ADS files have been gzipped and are in /home/staticdata.  The 2D
files are in /home/data.  The file name conventions are the same as
always:  "101rfXX.YY," where XX is the research flight number and YY is
either 2D or ads.

As I told you previously, I'm going to be working with the files in two
groups.  I'll do final processing of RF01-RF08 first and will then move
on to RF09-RF16.  Thus, I won't be preparing any more 2D and ADS images
for you for a little while.

Let me know if you have any questions on the above.

Thanks for your help!

                           Krista

Several weeks ago, I was sent several copies of two photos taken of the

both aircraft and all crew involved, and the other photo shows only the
RAF crew, SHEBA C-130 PIs, and the C-130.  If you would like to have one

My apologies for the delay in notifying you all sooner of the

I have archived to the MSS SHEBA PMS-2D and ADS stripped data for flights
RF06, RF07 and RF08.  I left the unzipped ADS files in my temp space:
/home/tmp/ron

-rw-rw-r--   1 ron      proj     376527188 Sep  1 08:23 101rf05.ads

-rw-rw-r--   1 ron      proj     354631140 Sep  1 08:23 101rf06.ads

If and when you don't need these, you may delete them or let me know
and I'll delete them.

I just got a new master MSS RAF directory, so people can download these new
files using my "msgetads" script.  I already modified it to accept the new
"ads" naming convention.

Ron,

Sound great....thanks!

Um, probably an obvious question on my part, but I noticed in your email
message below that you didn't mention archival of the RF05 files.  I'm assuming
this was simply an omission on your part and that the RF05 ADS image and 2D
file are archived up on the MSS.  Correct?

Ron,

Okay, there are a few more files ready for archival on the MSS.

I've finished stripping the 2D data from the tapes for RF09 and RF10.
The ADS images for these two flights are also ready.  The gzipped ADS
image and 2D file for RF09 are in /home/data on mistral, and the gzipped
ADS and 2D files for RF10 are in /home/staticdata.  Sorry, but I had to
gzip the ADS images in order to preserve enough room on the disk for
additional files as I get them ready.

Let me know if you have any problems getting the four new files up to
the MSS.

Thanks!

Krista

Ron,

The 2D and ADS files for SHEBA RF11 are in /home/staticdata and are
ready to go up to the MSS.  I've changed the group on both to proj.

Let me know when the 2D and ADS files for RF09-RF11 have been
successfully archived, and I'll remove them from the disk in order to
make room for the next flights to be processed.

Thanks!

Krista

Krista,

I have archived ads and 2D from RF09.  I moved the gzipped RF10 to /home/tmp
(which is on chinook)and unzipped them.  I will archive those after 5:00 p.m.
since that type of transfer (from a chinook disk) really eats up the network
bandwidth.  I will archive RF11 ASAP, since they have not been compressed.

Krista,

Sorry I haven't gotten back with you sooner.  I should have reported that the
ADS and PMS-2D stripped data for RF09, RF10 and RF11 have been archived to the
MSS as of late Monday the 21st.

Please let me know when you have more for me.  (I have SHEBA ADS uncompressed
images for RF05, RF06, RF07, RF08 and RF10 in /home/tmp/ron.)

Ron,

Have you been able to archive the 2D and ADS files for SHEBA RF09 and
RF10 yet?  We're running out of disk space again, and I need to be able
to start pulling down additional ADS images for flights RF03 and RF04 in
order to continue with the first-run processing of the data.

Any space you could free up for me would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!

Krista

Ron,

Quick question for you.  When Chris ran dnload on the SHEBA RF16 data
tape and downloaded the 2D, ADS, and MCR data, did you go ahead and
archive the 2D and ADS files (101rf16.ads and 101rf16.2D) to the MSS?  I
want to know if I need to process these two files for you again.

Thanks.

Krista

Krista,

I did indeed archive all the SHEBA RF16 data:  ads, 2D, mcr and tape.  The
ADS and tape images can be retrieved via my "msgetads" script; the 2D image
via my msget2d script.  (I have to write the script for the MCR.)

Ron,

I have a few more SHEBA files ready for archival.  The 2D and ADS images
for RF12 and RF13 are in /home/staticdata and are ready to go up to the
MSS.  Note that the RF12 ADS image has been gzipped to conserve space.
The group on all four files has been changed to proj.

Please let me know as soon as these files have been archived so that I
can remove them from /home/staticdata to free up more space.

Thx.

Krista

I have archived both the 2D and ADS images for RF12 to the MSS.  I'm now
working on RF13.  I'll let you know when they are done.

Krista,

OK.  RF13 stripped ADS and 2D files have now been archived to the MSS.
If you're planning to use the "msget" scripts on these, please wait until
I update RAF's master MSS directory list (should be ready tomorrow).

FYI, in /home/tmp/ron I still have stripped ADS files for RF05-RF08, RF10 and
RF12 and one stripped 2D file, RF10.  I can delete those if you have no need
for them.

Ron,

The ADS and 2D files for SHEBA RF14 are ready to go up to the MSS.  Both
files are in /home/data.

If you could go ahead and archive them as soon as possible, I would
appreciate it, as we're running low on disk space in both /home/data and
/home/staticdata.

Thanks!

Krista

Krista,

I just finished archiving to the MSS the Stripped PMS-2D and ADS files for
SHEBA RF14 (/home/data/101rf14.2D and /home/data/101rf14.ads).

I have yet to update the master MSS directory, so they won't yet be
available via my "msget" scripts.  I hope to do that later today.

Ron,

Okay, the ADS and 2D files for SHEBA RF15 are now in /home/staticdata.
The group for each has been changed to proj.  Please go ahead and
archive them to the Mass Store.

I believe that should be it for the 16 research flights.  Please let me
know as soon as possible if there are any ADS or 2D files which have not
been archived to the MSS.

Thanks.

The stripped ADS and PMS-2D files for RF15 have been archived to the MSS.
This does complete the archive of ADS and PMS-2D images for all the research
flights.  Are you not planning to do the ferry flights?  What about the
stripped MCR data?

Yes, I do plan to archive the stripped MCR data, but after I get done
processing and releasing the C-130 data set.

Thanks for your help.

Hi Chris,

Okay, assuming everything works out as planned over the next couple of
days (i.e., the planets are in the appropriate alignment, etc.), I would
like to be able to start production processing for SHEBA next Wednesday
or Thursday (11/18 or 11/19).  You wanted me to check with you before I
start the production processing.  Will this proposed schedule work for
you?

Let me know if you see any problems.

Krista

Subject: Status of SHEBA C-130 Data Set


All,

Given that we are fast approaching the time period in which I had
forecasted delivery of the SHEBA C-130 data set, I thought I'd better
email all of you and let you know the status of the processing work
that's going on here at the RAF.

As I mentioned previously at the post-SHEBA data review meeting in
August, it was my goal to complete the processing and full
quality-checking of the data set prior to Thanksgiving (i.e., in
mid-November).  I and my colleagues here at the RAF have been pushing to
meet this goal for the past several weeks.  However, I wanted to inform
you all now that it will not be possible for me to complete all of the
final, production processing and data set documentation for a release
prior to Thanksgiving.  We (the RAF) are working to fine-tune some of
our calibration data and processing algorithms, and that work must be
completed prior to my beginning production processing.  It is my present
plan that the final "touches" will be completed by the middle of next
week and that I can shortly thereafter begin production processing.

I realize that there is great interest in this data set.  For that
reason, I and others here at the RAF have been going over the data for
each flight very carefully in an effort to find as many problems and/or
limitations as possible before distributing the data set to the
scientific public.  Hence, another reason for the delay on my end.
However, I firmly believe that it's better to find problems now before
rushing into a release and discovering larger issues later on.

It is my hope that the low-rate SHEBA C-130 data will be released--along
with the documentation--in early December.  While I do not want to give
you all a hard and fast date at this time, I will say that it is my own
personal goal to release the data and documentation by around 11
December.

Related to the release, I wanted to ask for some information from each
of you at this time.  Along with the final data files, I will be
preparing and distributing a complete project documentation notebook to
each of the C-130 PIs.  This is how the notebooks will be distributed
(the numbers indicated are the number of notebooks that will be sent to
each group):

Curry group -- 2
Hudson -- 1
D. Rogers -- 1
SPEC -- 1
Valero group -- 1
RSF (AIMR) -- 1
Hallett -- 1
NASA/FIRE ACE -- 1

I would ask that a member of each of the above groups please email me a
mailing address to which you would like your notebook(s) sent.  Also,
please notify me as soon as possible if you feel I have omitted anyone
from this list whom you feel should receive a final notebook.

That's all for now.  I apologize for the delay in the release of the
C-130 data, and I sincerely hope that this will not inconvenience any of
you in terms of your research work with the data.  However, I firmly
believe that this slight delay will enable us (the RAF) to deliver to
you a better and more complete final product.

Should any of you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact
me here at the RAF (303-497-1031 or krista@ucar.edu).

Best regards,

Krista

Bruce,

I will look into the code for the purpose of understanding why the
measurements diverge or have obviously artificial values.  I did
not develop the code originally, so I need to investigate the intent
and design of code first.  Hopefully, that will help me understand
its shortcomings.  (I know Allen Schanot was involved, but he's on
vacation until Monday.)

So far as changing the code to fix the problems, I'm not sure that
can be done quickly.  From Krista's and your previous correspondence,
it is unclear whether I can change the code in a way that is acceptable
and meets your data delivery timeline.

I'll keep you posted.

Thanks Ron,
I plan to give you a slightly different front end for the Cloud Pass
statistics, but what you have right now is fine. Thanks for setting this up
and reminding me about the change from chinook to raf. I'll be giving you
the QC report after final approval from the Queen of SHEBA.

Darrel and Krista,

I have copied all the files over to our web directory and created some
simple
interface pages to tie all of them together.  Check out the URL:
  RAF Home Page
    Field Projects
      1998 - SHEBA                                    <-- ATD's SHEBA page
------> RAF's SHEBA Documentation
         http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/SHEBA/      <-- RAF's SHEBA page

For Darrel:
Please remove any future references to "chinook" in your HTML files, since
our web server is now named "raf.atd.ucar.edu," and "chinook" is within
UCAR's
firewall and not accessible from outside NCAR.  (I did so in all these
pages.)

Krista,

Just a reminder that I have the following SHEBA stripped raw ADS files in my
TEMP directory (/home/tmp/ron) in case you want to use them:

101rf05.ads  101rf06.ads  101rf07.ads  101rf08.ads  101rf10.ads  101rf12.ads

If you don't have any use for them, please let me know and I'll remove them
from the system.

Hi Ron,

Can you tell that I'm happy that production processing of the SHEBA data
is almost over?  Geez, it seems like I've been working on this forever.

Okay, the first eight flights (RF01-08) are ready to go up to the MSS.
Just one question for you, though.  Do you want me to change the
permissions on all of the files to read only before you archive them to
the MSS?  Let me know if you do, and I'll take care of it.

All of the files are in /home/productiondata.  Note that I've processed
RF01 into two files (101rf01a.cdf and 101rf01b.cdf).  There was a huge
time gap in the middle of the flight, and I was afraid that some users'
programs might not be able to "see" over the gap.  Hence, the two files.

Krista

Krista,

There is no need to change permissions on the netCDF files.  I'll archive
them probably late today or early tomorrow, since I soon have a Mass Store
Committee meeting at ML.

Krista,

I have three files in the ...proj/101/Production/ directory.  Do these meet
your needs?
     msls.101     <--  MSS directory listing of all project bitfiles as of now
     taplog.101   <--  MSS bitfile log for RF01A through RF16
     vars_netCDF  <--  Variable list from 101rf01a.cdf (tab-separated fields)

You may also be interested in my raw tape log:
     ...proj/101//Production/archive/tapes.101

If you want separate listings for MCR and stripped ADS data I can make them
up from the "msls.101" file unless you want them in some other form.

Okay, the last eight low-rate netCDF files for SHEBA--for RF09-16--are
ready to go up to the Mass Store.  The files are sitting in
/home/productiondata.

Let me know when all 16 flights are archived, and I will move the files
over to the public ftp directory.

I will soon archive all the support files in the .../101/ directory and

Krista,

I have archived to the SCD Mass Store System (MSS) all the project support
files and two versions of the NIMBUS processor (8 December and 11 December)
used to produce the LRT netCDF production data set.  (Chris told me that he
made two updates to NIMBUS this week to fix problems you had with turning off
unwanted variables.  None of those changes should affect the production data,
but I thought it would be a good idea to keep both of the versions I tarred.)

Directory lists for the tar files can be found in the 101 project's Production
subdirectory (101.tar.dir, nimbus.tar.dir, nimbus_defaults.tar.dir).  The file
nimbus_defaults has the contents of the directory /home/local/proj/defaults.

Following is the current MSS list of all the archived bitfiles for this
project.  It also can be found in the local file:
     /home/local/proj/archives/msfiles/msls.8-101

Krista,

FYI, I updated the local MSS Master Directory, so now the "msget" scripts can
be used to retrieve the production netCDF files for SHEBA.

Subject: Release of SHEBA Low Rate Data Set
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Length: 6172
Status: OR

All,

Final production processing of the low rate C-130 data set for SHEBA has
been completed, and the sixteen final netCDF data files have been
archived to the NCAR Mass Store System (MSS).  The purpose of this email
message is to provide each of you with some information on how to get
copies of some (or all) of the low rate data files and to pass on some
additional information regarding various aspects of the C-130 data set.

For the next month (until approximately 15 January 1999), the low rate
data files will be made available here on the RAF computer system.  I
have placed all sixteen files in a public ftp directory here, and
following are the instructions for getting access to the data:

1)  Using ftp, connect to the RAF exposed host as follows:
     ftp raf.atd.ucar.edu
2)  Once connected, log on to the system as "anonymous";
3)  Enter your full email address as the password;
4)  Change to the appropriate SHEBA directory as follows:
     cd pub/tmp/sheba
5)  Switch to binary transfer by entering "bi" at the ftp prompt;
6)  Retrieve files to your system using "get [filename]".

In order to conserve disk space--and to hopefully speed up the file
transfer process--the netCDF files in the directory pub/tmp/sheba have
each been compressed using gzip.  Thus, each file ends with the suffix
".gz."  The naming convention for the data files is as follows:

101rfXX.cdf.gz

where XX is the research flight number.

Once you have retrieved a given file or files, you will need to run
gunzip (i.e., "gunzip [filename]") on the files in order to uncompress
them and prepare them for use.

Should you have trouble retrieving any of the files using ftp and the
gunzip utility, you can also obtain copies of the data by contacting Ron
Ruth, the RAF Data Manager.  Ron can provide you with copies of any or
all of the files on magnetic media.  Ron can be reached at the RAF by
phone at 303-497-1084 or by email at ruth@ucar.edu.

The PMS 2D probe data collected during SHEBA were processed and archived
in files separate from the final low rate netCDF files.  A 2D file was
generated for each flight, and these files are archived on the NCAR
MSS.  Users interested in obtaining copies of any or all of these 2D
files should contact Ron Ruth in order to arrange for the preparation
and shipping of these data.

Processing of the SHEBA MCR data has not yet been started.  I anticipate
starting on this task later this month or early in January.  However,
due to my commitment to be in the field in February/early march for
INDOEX, I cannot presently give a date by which I plan to have the MCR
data processed and released.  I will make more information available on
this matter as work progresses and I have a more realistic idea of how
much time will be involved.

In terms of the availability of high-rate C-130 data, I wish to
emphasize again that such data will be processed and released on an *as
requested basis only*.  This means that users interested in obtaining
high-rate data will need to send to the RAF a list of specific variables
and specific time segments for certain flights for which they wish to
obtain high rate data.  High rate data will not be generated for all
variables for each entire flight.  Inquiries regarding high rate data
should, as above, be directed to Ron Ruth.

 Judy Curry has already given me a list of time segments, variables, and
flights for which she would like to have high-rate data.  I will begin
generating these data as soon as possible and, once I have completed
this processing, I will see that the files are archived to the NCAR MSS
for all interested users.  I will also send out an email message to all
SHEBA C-130 PIs providing additional data quality information that is
pertinent to high-rate data and will let users know what time segments
and variables are available on the Mass Store System.  Users should
consult this information to see if the data they are interested in
already exist before contacting Ron Ruth to have additional high rate
processing done.

As I emailed to all C-130 PIs previously, I have prepared--and will soon
be sending out--SHEBA C-130 data documentation notebooks to each of the
C-130 PIs.  These notebooks contain critical information regarding the
content of the data set, the format of the final data products, and the
quality of the overall data set.  I encourage each of you to look over
the notebook you receive carefully before you begin working with the
data.  The notebook should prove valuable in explaining how the data are
formatted and how to interpret the various measurements.

If you are a C-130 PI and have not already done so, please email me your
mailing address so that I can ship you your notebook.  I need this
information as soon as possible, as I hope to ship the notebooks either
late this week or early next.

The last comment I would make in regard to the data notebooks is the
following.  We (the RAF) have made every effort to locate and document
as many problems with the SHEBA data set as possible.  However, given
the significant size of the data set (255 variables collected during
each of sixteen flights), it is entirely possible that we may have
missed something during our thorough quality-checking of each file.
Should any of you find a problem or discrepancy during your own analysis
of the data, I ask that you please notify me immediately so that I can
notify the other users and look into what, if anything, can be done to
solve the problem.

It was my sincere pleasure to work with you all over the course of the
SHEBA C-130 deployment.  It is my opinion that the data set collected on
the C-130 is of very good quality, and I hope each of you will find it
to be of great use to you in your research.  Also, my thanks to each of
you for your patience during the (somewhat lengthy) process of my
getting the data processed and released.  Hopefully, it was worth the
wait!

Should you have any questions or problems regarding the C-130 data set,
please do not hesitate to contact me here at the RAF.  My phone number
is 303-497-1031, and my email address is krista@ucar.edu.

Best regards,

Krista Laursen
SHEBA C-130 Project Manager

All,

I forgot to mention one item in the email message I just sent out about
the release of the low rate SHEBA C-130 data.

The video tapes recorded on the C-130 have been archived with Judy
Curry's group at CU.  Thus, should you be interested in viewing any of
the tapes or in obtaining tape copies, you will need to contact Judy in
order to make the necessary arrangements.

Please contact me if you have any questions on the above.

Krista

Ron,

Last Thursday (12/17), I met with Judy Curry and delivered to her her
copies of the SHEBA data documentation notebooks.  During this meeting,
Judy and I discussed the idea of putting the most important notebook
materials on line via the Web so that interested PIs can gain access to
the materials more readily.  I have agreed to do this and have already
converted several of the documents I prepared into HTML format.  I think
that this approach will prove helpful not only to users of the data set,
but also to the RAF.  I have already received several requests for
additional notebooks, and by having the materials on the Web, users will
be able to print out and assemble their own notebooks without the RAF
having to go to the time and expense.

I will assemble a basic Web page which explains the various materials
and provides links to each relevant document.  Once I get this ready
(probably immediately after the Christmas holiday...I'll be back in the
office on 30 December), would you please place a link to it in the RAF
SHEBA Web site?  (In raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/SHEBA.)

Let me know if you have any questions on the above.  And thanks, in
advance, for your help on this.

Krista

Krista,

The idea of on-line documentation is great!  If only we could do that
regularly for all our projects.  I can easily add a hyperlink for your
stuff to RAF's Project page.  (I already have a hyperlink called "RAF's
SHEBA Documentation.")

Where do you have the HTML files now?  Although I can create symbolic links
to your files, I think it would be best to keep the documents in a directory
that is directly associated with the project.  I'd suggest either in the
project's "Production" subdirectory or in the "/opt/http/htdocs/Projects/SHEBA"
subdirectory.  You could name your directory "notebook" or "docs" (or some
other name of your choice) and place everything relative to that.  (If you
have graphics and/or photographs, I suggest having a "pics" subdirectory much
like I keep for the RAF site.)

What do you think?

Ron,

Cool, I'm glad you like this plan.  I'm presently storing all of the HTML
files on nuvola, my laptop.  Once I get everything assembled and tested out,
I'll gladly remove them from my computer and transfer them to one of the two
directories you mentioned.  I'm thinking it might be best to put all of the
files in the /Projects/SHEBA directory you mention below.

I'm hoping to finish everything up shortly after I get back in the office on
30 December.  I'll let you know when I'm ready to go and when I'll be ready
to transfer the files to the appropriate directory.

I'm really beginning to think that on-line documentation might be a good
way to go for all future projects.  It would save the RAF the cost and time
of having to assemble notebooks, and the final materials would be readily
available to all interested users.  I think maybe we should bring up this
idea for discussion with the other project managers at some point in the
very near future.

Have a good Christmas!

Krista

Ron,

I have finished getting the SHEBA data documentation ready to go on line
via the RAF Web site.  It is my recommendation that a link to the
relevant Web page I have designed be put into the existing RAF SHEBA
project documentation Web page (i.e., at
http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/SHEBA.

There are a number of files which will need to be transferred to the
appropriate directory.  Following are the files I have created which
need to placed in the right location.  I have placed all of them in
/home/tmp/krista:

shebadocs.html (main Web page I designed; all other html files are
linked to here)
sheba_ftimes.html
sheba_tplog.htm
sheba_dqsumm.html
dqorf01.htm
dqorf02.htm
dqorf03.htm
dqorf04.htm
dqorf05.htm
dqorf06.htm
dqorf07.htm
dqorf08.htm
dqorf09.htm
dqorf10.htm
dqorf11.htm
dqorf12.htm
dqorf13.htm
dqorf14.htm
dqorf15.htm
dqorf16.htm
sheba_irulog.htm
sheba_insts.html
sheba_vars.html
sheba_vidlog.htm

Additionally, Darrel has prepared some files for me which also need to
be transferred to the right directory.  The first file is
"qcReview.html", and it is in home/ftp/pub/darrel/sheba.  There are also
two subdirectories in /home/ftp/pub/darrel/sheba called
"concentrationQA" and "lwcQA", and these two subdirectories and the
files within them need to be transferred "as is" to the new Web page
location.  What I mean by this is that, in qcReview.html, Darrel refers
to the figure (JPEG) files in the two subdirectories by referencing the
subdirecotry path (i.e., <A HREF=lwcQA/filename).  Thus, the two
subdirectories need to be created in the documentation Web site as well.

Once you have created the new page within the RAF SHEBA Project page,
let me know and I'll check it out to make sure everything looks okay.
I'll then send out an email message to the SHEBA PIs announcing the new
Web site.

Thanks for your help, and let me know if you have any questions.

Krista

Hi Ron,

I have one small change that I need you to make to the SHEBA data
documentation page (shebadocs.html) that I had you put on-line
yesterday.

At the very bottom of the page, I have a link that says "RAF SHEBA
Project Documentation Page."  I put this in when you still had the page
listing the two links to Darrel's SHEBA Web pages.  Can you please
remove this link in shebadocs.html?  Obviously, now all it does is take
the user to the top of shebadocs.html, and I don't think that's
necessary.  I do, however, want to leave the link in to the RAF home
page.

Let me know when you've completed making this change, and I'll send an
email message out to users about this new documentation Web site.
Thanks!

Krista

All,

The SHEBA C-130 data set documentation (most of the materials made
available in the previously-released data notebooks) have been put
on-line via the RAF Web site.  This will enable all users of the data
set to access the most critical documentation and data quality materials
and to assemble their own copies of the documentation package.

To access the documentation materials, go to the following Web site:

http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/SHEBA/

The introductory text at the Web site is fairly explanatory and outlines
for users how to make best use of the presented materials.  However, I
would like to stress again here that the best way to make optimum use of
the documentation Web site and the C-130 data set is to visit each of
the links listed on the above Web page and to print out the associated
material.  This will give all users a complete overview of the quality
and features of the data set.

One note in regard to the Data Quality Summary presented via the
documentation Web site.  Users will note that, associated with the
Summary, there are links to five figures.  The instructions I have
listed for downloading these five figure files are based on my own
experiences with testing out the links using Netscape.  Individual users
may encounter different instructions/interface windows when attempting
to download the five PostScript files.  Should you have any problems
with downloading the files via the links, please follow the instructions
listed for accessing the files using direct ftp.

Please feel free to forward this message on to any other members of the
scientific community who will be working with the SHEBA C-130 data set.

I hope you all will find the new documentation Web page useful.  Please
do not hesitate to contact me with any questions, problems, or concerns
you may have, either with the Web materials or with the C-130 data set
itself.

Best regards,

Krista Laursen

Hi Ron,

Yes, I already received the message below from NASA.

No, I don't think there's anything we need to be doing.  I explained to NASA
early on that all of our archival would be done via the NCAR Mass Store, and
I provided the NASA data group with a copy of the final data notebook.  Also,
since we were funded to support SHEBA, we don't technically need to follow all
of the NASA/FIRE-ACE rules and regulations.  I think the notifications I have
already sent out will be sufficient to cover what users need.

Thanks for thinking of this, though.

Krista

Ron,

Okay, since I'm back from INDOEX now, I suppose I can't delay the
inevitable for much longer.  It's time I started working on the archival
and processing of the SHEBA MCR data.

The first task I'll be starting on is stripping the MCR data from each
of the SHEBA data tapes and having you archive the raw MCR data files up
to the MSS.  I think you and I discussed this issue once before, but a
big problem will probably be the size of the raw MCR data files.  The
maximum size of each raw file is 1 Gbyte, and for SHEBA, there were
typically three files for each flight (two of which were 1 Gbyte in
size, one of which was about 0.5 Gbyte in size).  My question to you is
whether there will be any problem in transferring these large files up
to the MSS, or were you able to get this "bandwidth" problem solved
adequately when you needed to archive the raw data tapes up to the MSS?

I'll probably begin stripping off the MCR data within about the next
week, and I'll let you know when files are ready.  I suspect that's
going to be a fairly slow process, as we're still limited on disk space
on mistral and I'll probably only be able to get one flight worth of raw
MCR data on the disk at a time.

Let me know if you see any problems with executing this task.  Thanks!

Krista

Krista,

The maximum file size I can transfer from Jeffco to the MSS is 1.5GB, so
you are OK, and the 1GB size should work well.  I have no problem with
transferring the files to the MSS.  If you have an order, I can try to set
up a script which will do the archiving in an incremental fashion.  That
will make things easier for me.

I plan to archive the files to the MSS directory /RAF/1998/101/MCR with
the standard RAF naming convention, e.g., /RAF/1998/101/MCR/RF01A,
/RAF/1998/101/MCR/RF01B, /RAF/1998/101/MCR/RF01C, etc.

You may want to ask Mike about disk space.  I know that Chris got a 9GB
drive for stashing his stuff, so there may be space available somewhere
besides /home/data.  I know that /home/staticdata doesn't have much space, but
there seems to be a lot of garbage in there.  I'm not sure how to handle it,
because I don't know who "keeps the store" in that directory.  I can probably
clean up /home/productiondata which would give you about 2+GB.  There is
presently 2.7GB available in /home/tmp, but due to backup needs, I hate to
eat up all that space.

Hi Mike,

Very shortly, I will begin work on archiving the raw MCR data collected
during SHEBA.  This process requires using dnload to create raw MCR data
files from each of the original data tapes.  In general, there will be
about 2.5 Gbytes of MCR data per SHEBA data tape.

Obviously, these data are going to take up quite a bit of disk space on
mistral.  Ron suggested I check with you before beginning this stripping
work in order to find out:  a)  where will be the best place for me
store the raw data files before they get copies to the MSS (I'm thinking
it's going to have to be /home/data, /home/staticdata,
/home/productiondata, or some combination of all three); b)  if there
are presently any other large (around 9 gbyte?) disk partitions
available on any system here at the RAF where I can put these files.
It's going to be an incredibly slow process if I can only do one flight
at a time because we don't have enough disk space to accommodate more
files.

What do you think?

Krista

Ron,

The first group of SHEBA raw MCR data files is ready to go up to the
MSS.  These files are for RF01 and RF02 and are located in /home/data on
mistral.

There are four files for RF01, and the file name convention is
101rf01.rawMCRX, where X=a,b,c or d.  For RF02, there are three files,
and the naming convention is 101rf02.rawMCRX, where X=a,b or c.

Let me know when you have archived these files to the MSS so that I can
remove them from /home/data and continue on to the next group of files.

Thx.

Krista

Krista,

I sent one up about half an hour ago; I suspect it is still on its way.
I will do them one at a time so we don't overload the system.  The other
alternative is to wait until after 5 p.m.

I'll let you know when they have been archived.  Then you can do with them
what you want.

I decided to use the following file-naming format on the MSS:
     /RAF/1998/101/MCR/fltno
    where, fltno = RFxxy (example RF02A)

Will the processed MCR data be archived as well?  If so, will they be
netCDF files or another binary set?  (If the latter, I need to devise a
naming convention for them unless they use another format like jpg or gif.)

Okay, Ron.  Ready whether you wanted them or not; I have some new MCR data
files ready to go up to the MSS.  These files are for RF03 and RF04 and are
in /home/data on mistral.

There are three files for each flight, and the file name convention is
as follows:
     101rfXX.rawMCRy
   where XX=03 or 04, and y=a, b, or c.

Please archive the six new files up to the MSS.

Dick -- Unfortunately, /home/data is now at 84% capacity.  So, we'll
have to hold off on starting to process the INDOEX tapes until after the
six new MCR files have been archived to the MSS.  As soon as they have
been backed up, I'll remove them from /home/data to free up the space.

Ron,

Dick and I have decided to put off starting on the archival of the
INDOEX data until next week.  So, I've gone ahead and filled up
/home/data with more SHEBA MCR files.

In /home/data, you will find raw MCR data files for SHEBA RF05 and
RF06.  As usual, the file name convention is as follows:
101rfXX.rawMCRy, where XX=05 or 06 and y=a,b, or c.

Please archive these filess to the MSS and let me know when I can remove
them from /home/data and continue on to the next flights.

Thx.

Krista

Okay.  I'll go ahead and remove the 05 and 06 files from /home/data and will
move on to the next batch.

Ron,

The raw MCR data files for SHEBA RF07 and 08 are now in /home/data and
are ready for archival to the MSS.  Same file name convention as
before:  101rfXX.rawMCRy, where XX=07 and 08 and y=a,b, or c.

Let me know when you've archived them to the MSS.

Thx.

Krista

Hi Nancy,

Big "whoops" on my part for not getting back to you on this.  Sorry, but I
got tied up with several other things over the past few days.

Off the top of my head, I don't know if the base_time and time_offset
parameters are set incorrectly in the two files for SHEBA flight RF01,
although in generating the two files, I definitely did follow the logic that
the b file follows the a.

Ron, can you please take a look at Nancy's concern below and see if you can
find anything amiss with the time parameters in the two RF01 files?  Please
email your findings to both Nancy and I.  Thanks!

Krista

Nancy,

You've uncovered a "feature" of our data-acqusition and -processing system.
It does not increment the date when midnight passes.  As a result, the
"starting" date is kept.  The second section of RF01 really should be labeled
05/05/1998.  I will fix the MSS Bitfile Log file, but the netCDF file still
will have this contamination.

I will see what kind of effort it will take to make a software change that
will correct this problem in future data sets.

Thanks for bringing this to our attention.

Hi Ron,

I've resumed the task of downloading and archiving the SHEBA MCR data to
the MSS.  I just completed downloading the files from RF09, and they are
presently in /home/data and are ready to go up to the MSS.  Can you get
them archived for me?  The file names are 101rf09.rawMCRX, where X=a, b,
or c.  Let me know when you've archived them, and I'll move on to RF10.

Also, I have a question for you.  I need to start testing out the MCR
processor program, and I would like to run it on some raw INDOEX MCR
data.  Do you have a script already in place that I can use to pull raw
MCR data files down from the MSS?  If not, can you tell me what the full
command line is that I need to use in order to retrieve MCR files?

Thanks!

Krista

Krista,

I'll archive the SHEBA MCR data later this afternoon.

I don't yet have a script to retrieve the raw INDOEX MCR data, but now that
you've jogged my brain, I'll work on it.  It will be called "msgetmcr," and
it may be ready later today.  I'll let you know.

In the meantime, you can use the following procedure:
  1)  Locate the file(s) you want
      They have names of the form /RAF/1999/102/MCR/RFxxs,
        where, xx = flight number
                s = segment letter
      You can search RAF's master MSS directory list using "vi:"
        vi /home/local/proj/archives/msfiles/msraw.RAF.all
          /RAF.1999.102.MCR   <-- find INDOEX project MCR data
          /RFxx               <-- find flight number xx
          :q                  <-- get full MSS bitfile name(s) before exiting.
  2)  Submit one job at a time to get each bitfile of interest:
        nrnet msget $MIGS/<localfile> l df=tr r flnm=<full MSS bitfile name>
        Notes:  Allow no white space between the "flnm=" and the bitfile name.
                An example <localfile> is 102rf01a if a script were used.
                Returned file MUST be put into your MIGS directory.
                Since these files are large, I'd wait for one segment to
                 come down before submitting the next job.

Please let me know if you have any problems.

Ron

Ron,

I have downloaded the raw MCR data files from the RF13 SHEBA data tape,
and they are ready for archival to the MSS.  The files are in /home/data
and follow the usual naming convention (101rf13.rawMCRx).  Please let me
know when they've been archived, and I'll move on to the next flight.

Thanks.

Krista

Krista,

I'm on vacation starting today.  I hope to get these files archived for
you, but please save the rest of the flights until after I return on 6 July.
The "A" segment is on its way now.  My plane for Pennsylvania departs early
tomorrow morning, so if you haven't heard from me by then, I won't have
finished.  It's up to you, then, whether to keep the files around for two
weeks or use the disk space they take up for other files.

Ron

I guess this completes the stripped MCR data archiving for this project.

Krista,

Apparently, since the files are now subject to the scrubber, they were purged
from the system after not being accessed in 30 days.  Whoever put them there
(I'm sure it was not I.) should have received an email warning from the
scrubber that they were to be deleted.  Do you want me to restore them?
Do you know what all the files were in the "sheba" directory?  There is
not much there now.

(I just sent an email to Mike about setting up an ftp "project" directory
that would not be subject to the scrubber.)

Yes, please restore all of the low-rate SHEBA data files to the directory.  Also,
please restore all of the high-rate data files that I created for Judy Curry.
(These were also archived to the MSS.)

Also, please send an email to Greg at JOSS telling him that you'll be restoring
the files.

Thx.

Krista

Greg,

It appears that our scrubber remove the files from the disk partition.  Ron Ruth is
working on restoring the low- and high-rate data files and will contact you when they
are back on-line.

Thanks for bringing this to our attention!

Krista

Krista,

I have brought down all the production SHEBA LRT netCDF data files from
the MSS, but I cannot put them into the ~ftp/pub/tmp/sheba directory
because I don't have permission.  I can, instead, restore them to our
new ~ftp/pub/projects directory by creating a sheba subdirectory.  If
you want, you can then create a link to the new files.

   Otherwise, you may want to change the group assignment of the current
sheba directory to "proj"  Change to the ~ftp/pub/tmp directory, then give
the command:
     chgrp proj sheba
Then I should be able to access it.

Thanks.

Ron,

Go ahead and place the files in the ftp/pub/project directory.  Also, please
move the SHEBA QC document files (shebaqc_fig1-5.ps) from
/home/ftp/pub/tmp/sheba to the new project directory.  I have changed the
permissions on the files so that you can do so.

Once you have moved the above PostScript files, you will need to make change to
one of the on-line SHEBA documents.  (I don't have the permission to do so.)
On the main page located at raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/SHEBA, in Section 3
("Data Quality Summary"), please change instruction item 3) to tell people to
cd to the new, correct data storage directory for the PS files (~
ftp/pub/projects etc...whatever the SHEBA subdir will be).

Also, please download the high-rate files generated for Judy Curry to the new
ftp directory.

Last, when you have finished the above, please email Greg Stossmeister at JOSS
that the files have been placed in a new location.

Thanks for your help!

Krista

Yes, let's get together tomorrow and try to hash out what to do.  My own feeling is
that we should have disk space made available for the storage of files to be
distributed via ftp.  A lot of our users don't have (and maybe don't want) MIGS
accounts and find it much easier to get our final data files via ftp.  It also saves
us the headache of having to distribute magnetic tapes to folks at the end of
projects.  My opinion is that we need to purchase and/or make available extra disk
space specifically for the storage of ftp files.

You might want to include Jeff Stith in any meeting you try to set up for tomorrow.

Krista,

Well, it looks like INDOEX got in our way.  After bringing down all the
SHEBA LRT flights into my MIGS directory, I got only a few of them moved
into the ftp directory before it filled up the disk space.  When Mike set
up the new ftp/projects directory, he mentioned that this should not be
a place to put long-term data files because of the limited size of the
ftp partition.

So I am in a quandry about what to do now.  Perhaps we should try to get
together tomorrow to discuss this whole situation:  you, me, Mike, Dick,
Allen and anyone else we think should have input.

What are your thoughts?

Ron

Stephan,

You should be able to access the low rate C-130 data from the UCAR/JOSS Web
site.  Check out the following:

http://www.joss.ucar.edu/sheba/catalog/

JOSS is temporarily archiving the low rate data for us.

If you are unable to download the files you need from the JOSS site, please
contact Ron Ruth, the RAF data manager, and he can arrange to get you copies
of the low rate files.  Ron can be reached at 303-497-1084 or ruth@ucar.edu.
For future reference, all requests for RAF data products should be submitted
directly to Ron.

Prior to using the C-130 data products, I ask that you review and download
copies of all of the data documentation materials.  These are available
on-line at the following web site:

http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/SHEBA/

These materials will provide you with guidance in interpreting the data set
and provide a complete description of what is contained in the final data
set.

Regards,

Krista

Greg,

Sorry things are taking awhile, but our ftp disk space is virtually exhausted,
and current output from INDOEX is taking precedence over SHEBA.  I'm not sure
how long it will be before we can restore ALL of the SHEBA data, but we will
contact you when they are ready.  If there is something specific you need,
I can try to get you copies of the files, either via ftp transfer or via SCD
Mass Store path names.

In your latest email to Krista, you mentioned a need for 4 files, two of
which are available:
     ftp://raf.atd.ucar.edu/pub/tmp/sheba/shebaqc_fig1.ps"
     ftp://raf.atd.ucar.edu/pub/tmp/sheba/MCR02_0645.ch1

Two were special INDOEX files that are not for public release:
     102tf01mr.asc
     102tf02mr.asc

Ron

Greg,

As I emailed you previously, Ron Ruth is working on restoring these files to a
directory here at the RAF.  However, last I heard, I believe there was a problem
allocating enough disk space for all of the files.

Ron -- can you please eamil Greg to let him know what's being done in terms of
restoring the SHEBA C-130 data files?  Thanks.

Krista

Ron,

   Thanks for the reply. My main concern about this data is that other SHEBA
PIs are able to access this data. At JOSS we maintain the Data Archive for the
SHEBA project (please see www.joss.ucar.edu/cgi-bin/codiac/ds_proj?SHEBA ). 
In this archive we list NCAR C-130 data. If you try to access this dataset
you'll find that it is linked to your ftp site. My concern is for PIs who
may be trying to access these data and not finding them. Our link presupposes 
that you will maintain these datasets on-line. If that is not your intention,
or is not feasible over the long term, might I suggest that you perhaps give 
us a copy of your data and we will maintain it on-line on our disks (via 
the SHEBA archive) so SHEBA PIs can access it.

  By the way, I do not need any of the 4 files mentioned, I was only noting that 
that was all I found on your ftp site - no netCDF files.

Thanks,
  Greg

Greg,

   To me that is a great suggestion.  You can get other SHEBA project

   If you are able to retrieve netCDF files from the SCD Mass Store System
(MSS), following is the pertinent information (example full MSS bitfile

Ron,

That all sounds fine to me.

I have just one note in regard to your message to Greg.  Recall that I did some limited high-rate processing for
Judy Curry for each of the 16 SHEBA flights and then had you archive these files to the MSS.  Greg will also
need to retrieve those high-rate files and make sure they are accessible via the JOSS computer system.

Can you please email Greg back and outine for him where he can find the high-rate files for the SHEBA flights?

Also, Greg will need to make available the five PostScript figures that go along with the final SHEBA QC
document.  These files are called shebaqc_figX.ps, where X=1-5, and I have placed copies of them in my public
SHEBA ftp directory (/pub/tmp/sheba).  Can you please instruct Greg to get copies of those, also?

Thanks for your help on this.

Krista

These are available via our SHEBA web page, and I moved them from
pub/tmp/sheba/ to pub/projects/SHEBA/ so they now are NOT subject
to the scrubber.  I'll mention it to him, too.

Greg,

Krista made me aware that you also need two more data sources:
  1)  The netCDF files from the limited high-rate processing for Judy Curry
  2)  Five PostScript figures that go along with the final SHEBA QC document

Here is that information:
  1)  Curry's high-rate netCDF data are on the SCD Mass Store System (MSS):

Hi Ron,

I'm presently working on re-analyzing some of the SHEBA microphysical
data, and in the course of doing this, I was reminded of the corrections
that users must make to the previously released Gerber (PVM-100A) data.
You may or may not recall that, following the SHEBA and INDOEX projects,
Hermann Gerber re-calibrated our PVM-100A probe and gave us a set of new
calibration coefficients for the liquid water and particle surface area
channels of the instrument.

After I received the new cal. info. from Hermann, I sent an email
message off to Judy Curry and the other SHEBA PIs outlining the steps
for correcting the Gerber probe data.  I believe I may have neglected to
ask you to include these same instructions in the RAF SHEBA Project
Documentation web site.  I just looked at the site, and the instructions
are not there.

I believe it's very important that all users get access to this critical
correction information via the RAF SHEBA web site.  Thus, I would like
to ask that you add the following document/information to the SHEBA
documentation site.  You can find the document at the following URL:

http://polarbear.colorado.edu/polarbear.html

I'm not really sure what the best way is to incorporate this information
into our SHEBA documentation site.  Perhaps you can include the document
referenced above in the Data Quality Summary document.

Please download the document at the web site I referenced above and let
me know what your thoughts are regarding where to include it in our
SHEBA documentation site.  I would like to get this documentation
incorporated within the next two to three business days.

Thanks, in advance, for your help!

Krista

Krista,

I would suggest adding a link to the document on the RAF SHEBA home page.
I could easily put a little "new" sticker next to it to alert people to it.
(I have downloaded it.)

Krista,

At your request, I have added the Gerber correction page to our SHEBA web
site.  You can find it at the URL:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/SHEBA/gerber_fix.html
It is linked from item #13 of the "Data Quality Summary" where the PVM-100
is discussed, URL:
     http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/SHEBA/sheba_dqsumm.html
I did not edit item #13, but perhaps I should.

Like I did for INDOEX, I added a new link to the SHEBA "home" page called
"Updated Pages."  It lists changes to the site made since the official release
date.  In the case of SHEBA, I don't know the release date, but this is the
first significant change that I can remember.  It is an easy way for users
to directly access any new stuff.

I hope this is acceptable to you.

Ron,

I was just reviewing the "Data Quality Summary" document on-line for
SHEBA, and I found an error I made that needs to be corrected.

In number 8 in the "Data Quality Summary" document, I wrote that "GALT
data collected on the C-130 during INDOEX...."  Obviously, I should have
said "SHEBA" instead of INDOEX.  Can you please go into this Web
document, Ron, and replace INDOEX with SHEBA?  The document I'm
referring to is located at
http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/SHEBA/sheba_dqsumm.html.

Thanks a bunch!

Krista

Hi Ron -

Here's a reminder that the processed MCR files from SHEBA need to be
uploaded to mass store.  The files are on mistral in
/jnet/data/mcr/SHEBA/rfxx, where xx is the flight number.  So far, data
is complete for xx = 01, 02, 04, 06 and 07 (note that there is no rf03,
as no data was collected that flight).  Since the mcr area is almost
full, I'll stop processing data until this is uploaded.  I will also be
making a couple of datasets on exabyte tapes with this data next week,
so need to do that as well before removing the processed data and going
onto the next batch of flights.

Thx -

Mark

Mark,

I am in the thick of archiving the processed MCR files to the SCD Mass Store
System (MSS).  The directory /jnet/data/mcr/SHEBA has no rf07 subdirectory.
You mentioned in your email reminder (xx = 01, 02, 04, 06 and 07).  There are
a number of files in the "rf05" subdirectory as well as "rf08."  Do you want
me to archive them?  There are a few files in some other "rfxx" directories
as well.  Please give me the definitive list of directories/files that you
now want me to archive.  I am presently doing "rf03."

You can check the status of MCR archiving by checking the log file:
     /jnet/solaris/proj/101/Production/archive/mcr_arch_log.101

Mark,

I have archived to the SCD Mass Store System (MSS) the processed MCR files
from the directories:
  /jnet/data/mcr/SHEBA/rf01  (28 files) --> /RAF/1998/101/MCR/RF01.*
  /jnet/data/mcr/SHEBA/rf02  (45 files) --> /RAF/1998/101/MCR/RF02.*
  /jnet/data/mcr/SHEBA/rf04  (21 files) --> /RAF/1998/101/MCR/RF03.*
  /jnet/data/mcr/SHEBA/rf05  (30 files) --> /RAF/1998/101/MCR/RF04.*
  /jnet/data/mcr/SHEBA/rf06  (36 files) --> /RAF/1998/101/MCR/RF06.*
  /jnet/data/mcr/SHEBA/rf08  (48 files) --> /RAF/1998/101/MCR/RF08.*

The log file:
   /jnet/shared/proj/101/Production/archive/mcr_arch_log.101
has a log of the archive activity.  The script file:
   /jnet/shared/proj/101/Production/archive/arch_prod_mcr.101
was set up to do the work one subdirectory at at time.  A list of bitfiles
for this project can be found in the file:
   /jnet/shared/proj/101/Production/archive/msls.101

Great - thx, Ron.  I'll let you know when I have another batch to archive.
It'll be awhile, as I want to create a few copies of these for distribution
before getting rid of what's out there and processing some more.

Mark,

I'm setting up the jobs now and will probably begin the archiving later
this afternoon.  (I have to archive some ACE-Asia data first.)

Did you finish putting the SHEBA processed data onto the mass store, esp
flights 9-16?  I'm pretty sure you did, but want to make sure before I
delete it off of mistral.

Mark,

Sorry not to get back to you.  I did, indeed, complete the archive to the
SCD Mass Store System of processed MCR data for SHEBA.  I completed it on
Wednesday 5 September 2001.  See the log file:
     /jnet/shared/proj/101/Production/archive/mcr_arch_log.101

Mark,

I created a Mass Store bitfile log for the SHEBA Processed MCR data which
you can add to your MCR "SHEBAMCR.html" web page:
     <A HREF="/Catalog/taplogM_101.html>
It uses the RDP data-retrieval mechanism but is independent of the GUI per se.
RDP decided not to require projects prior to CY 2000 be added to their new
directory list.  When I get time, I could add some very popular older projects
into the new system.  SHEBA would certainly be one of the top ten.

Right now, I'm hesitant to put your MCR page in with the Technical Bulletins,
mainly because it doesn't conform to the format we've been using.  (I suppose
for the future, I could assgin a new, previously-unused bulletin number to
it.)  For now I think it is best to keep it on our home page.  For one, it
will more easily be seen.  If you strongly object, let's talk.

Hi Ron -

Krista and I are interested in testing a download for individual MCR
files, so we can see if they should be zipped before transfer, as well
as how much time each download would take.  There are MCR files residing
on mistral in /jnet/data/mcr/SHEBA under the rfxx subdirectories.  These
are processed files (i.e. not the raw ones), which we'd like to
eventually provide for users.  Of course, the best test would be to
select as large a file as possible.  Let me know if you need some more
info about this.  Looks like the interface you've developed for the mass
store would be really helpful for allowing users to get the MCR files.

At this point, I need to know how we can use your interface to download
a test MCR file.

Thx,

Mark

Mark,

Actually there are two interfaces in place for getting files from the MSS.
The one I'm using for RAF's web data catalog seems to me best for your
application.  For those I created HTML files with a hyperlink for each data
file that, when clicked, will invoke the ATD file retrieval cgi program.
The user then fills in the appropriate information in the ensuing pop-up
window, and the request is handled automatically after that.

To archive these processed MCR files on the MSS is easy enough.  We should
define reference MSS paths for this data type.  Two principal MSS paths are
now in use:  RAF's original path and the new /ATD/DATA/ path.  For production
data, ATD began using the new path starting in calendar year 2000.  (It is
acceptable to use this new path for older data, too, but at this point I have
used it only sparingly for RAF's older data.)

For the SHEBA project, the path roots are:
     /RAF/1998/101/
     /ATD/DATA/1998/SHEBA/N308D/
We can append a name to each of these that points to the processed MCR data.

For the new ATD path, I devised a long descriptive name that includes the
flight date and start/end times as well as data format.  An unrelated example:
  /ATD/DATA/2000/Sea_Salinity/N130AR/LRT/RF03.20000818.005729_062737.PNI.nc

This interprets as:  Sea Salinity project on our EC-130Q with Low-Rate
Turbulence data for flight RF03 which occurred on 18 August 2000 from
00:57:29 to 06:27:37.  The data are production nimbus (PNI) in netCDF
format (nc).

Let's get together and discuss this.

Mark,

It was working the last time I checked it.  I'd try calling Susan Stringer
(ext. 2024) to see what's going on.  The GUI that pops up has a button
asking whether or not to gzip the resulting file.  (I believe it is "on"
by default.)  If the file already is gzipped on the MSS, I'm not sure of
the result.  Virtually all RAF's archived MSS files are not gzipped.

Mark,

I just looked at the ATD FL ftp cache, and the file 1998.101.mcr.test has
both a gzipped and ungzipped version.  There is also a file there called
1998.101.mcr.zip.gz.  All have today's date.

I'm not sure what troubles you're having.  My netscape upzipped the files
between FL and here when I was testing.  Could that be happening to you, too?

Ron -

Yes, I tested things a few times - thus the multiple files.  I hadn't thought
about Netscape unzipping the files, but if mine does, then that's what I'm
seeing.  Thx for looking into it.

Ron - Looks like my PC does unzip the file - just doesn't rename it from a .gz
extension.  So, it looks like the file transfer process works fine.  Now, I have
to get all the data processed!
