Archive notes -- Project 1998-101 SHEBA
---------------------------------------

10 July 1998  Ron Ruth
----------------------
This project created the largest-ever raw ADS files for any RAF project.
Because of the current limitation of the `msimport' command on the SCD Mass
Store System (MSS), these files had to be split up into segments much as was
done when the MSS had a much smaller capacity.

The tape for RF06 staged incorrectly at first but produced the bogus bitfile:
  /RAF/1998/101/RF06/R1267.  It was removed on 10 July 1998.
# chinook/ron % nrnet msrm % r flnm=/RAF/1998/101/RF06/R1267 wpwd=RAFDMG
# Sequence number = MI5845
# chinook/ron % date
# Fri Jul 10 15:45:28 MDT 1998
#  From SCD email message, bitfile removed @ 10 Jul 1998 15:45:29

I began archiving the raw ADS tapes for SHEBA Phase II.

Archiving is progressing slowly.  To date the average wall-clock time to
complete a job has been about 151 minutes.  There have been two failures
(apparently caused by jobs hanging).  In one case it was restarted by the
operator and rerun to successful completion; in the other, the operator
dropped the job.  In the latter case the job seems to have written a complete
bitfile, but it will have to be redone to make sure.  The number of jobs per
day also has been disappointing; for the Phase II jobs so far (3 days), only
12 jobs have completed (9 successfully).

Archiving of the raw ADS tapes for Phase II is now complete.  In general
operator error was responsible for most of the tape-archive failures, but
things would be eased if the source tapes were split into manageable files
in the first place.

parent directory for a complete list of raw ADS tapes and MSS bitfiles.
