This set of files was tarred on 8 December during production processing.
Flights processed using this version of NIMBUS may be limited but probably
include RF01 through RF08 and may include RF08 and RF09.  Chris was releasing
new versions of NIMBUS during the production processing after Krista found
bugs relating to turning off "first" measurements (like VLA, MRLA and PLWCC)
when only the second ones (VLA1, MRLA1 and PLWCC1) were desired.  Krista
chose to output all of them to alleviate the problem.  The changes should
not affect any data.
