Allen,

I have archived to the SCD Mass Store System (MSS) all the raw ADS research
flight tapes for project 1996-110 (Coastally Trapped Waves) with the exception
of R1087 (RF08).  This process occurred in "record" time, since I started
it at about noon today, and it took a little over 3 1/2 hours.  Two tries were
needed to archive RF01 and RF02, but I suspect it was a problem with SCD's
tape drives, since a second attempt with each of the tapes was successful.

In case you are interested, the archive summary can be found in the file:
      /home/local/proj/110/Production/archive/tp2ms.summary
For each tape, it includes the total number of records and bytes archived.  If
you suspect that any of these bitfiles has an incorrect length, please let me
know, since each archive job ran to completion without error.  (None required
more than one MSS bitfile.)

Last week, Bob Rilling was able to make a "good" copy of RF08 using the
header records from the "corrupt" tape and the remade "data" tape.  (He has a
software program that can do that job.)  I plan to deliver that "good" tape to
the SCD machine room tomorrow and archive it, too.

I'll write you again when I have further information on RF08.

Ron,

Your tape R1087 has been re-assembled from its two parts.  Not nearly
as hard as reconstituting a cow from hamburger -- it was really no
trouble at all.

The tapes will be in your box at FL1.  Let me know if you want them
sent to jeffco.  

Total tape length was on the order of 114.6 Mbytes, in a single file.
Record info is as follows (just the first couple of hundred records):

malt > tcopy /dev/nrlxb1
file 1: record 1: size 20
file 1: records 2 to 3: size 6408
file 1: records 4 to 40: size 31032
file 1: record 41: size 28812
file 1: records 42 to 294: size 31032
file 1: record 295: size 28812
^Cfile 1: records 296 to 329: size 31032
interrupted at file 1: record 329
total length: 10124828 bytes

project.

Allen,

I don't know how you did it, but the ancient reference to the "TBM mass
storage system" crept back into your cover letter for 6-110.  The MSS
is now known simply as the SCD Mass Store System.  I hope it isn't too
late for you to change those references.

You included an ADS tape summary.  As part of the ADS archiving procedure
I create one, too.  In the future, perhaps we can save some duplication of
effort.

The other documents appear to be in good order.  I brought them into the
110 Production subdirectory in ASCII form, making some minor formatting
changes (e.g., we don't need page numbering) and plan to archive them to
the MSS with the other support files and documentation for this project.

P.S.  I changed the "TBM" reference in the ASCII version of the cover letter.

Allen,

I have archived to the SCD Mass Store System all the data and support files
for project 6-110 Coastally Trapped Waves (Rogers).

If there are project-related files in directories other than the
"/home/local/proj/110" path that you want archived, please let
me know.

Allen,

The request went out to Jean Hurst last Thursday (5th).  I would expect
the copying to be completed by the end of this week.  I'll give here
a call to see how she's coming along then get back to you.  I'm having
her make low-density ExaByte copies, since that is what Dave Rogers has
requested in the past.  I assume you want us to ship the tapes directly
to him.

Ron,

I mentioned by phone, but this way too.

Dave Rogers netCDF tapes went out this morning.  They are:
1 exabyte with LRT data
2 exabytes with the HRT data  

The HRT took two.  These are low density TAR tapes.

Thanks.  I'll pass the word to Al Schanot.

On 16 December 1996 I archived to the SCD Mass Store System all the
reprocessed data and support files for project 6-110 Coastally Trapped
Waves (Rogers).

Jean has copied the data to a new ExaByte tape, and it was shipped via
UPS 2-day air to Dr. Rogers on 20 December 1996.
