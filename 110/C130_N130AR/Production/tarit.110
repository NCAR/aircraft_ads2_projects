#  Note:  Create a copy of, modify and run this script from a project's

#
#  Assumptions:
#   1.  Directory structure for projects is $LOCAL/proj/<3-digit project #>
#           having a "Production" subdirectory
#   2.  Project's name (only its name!) is in the file $LOCAL/proj/ProjectName
#   3.  A "proj.info" file exists in the project's "Production" subdirectory
#
#  Get setup information for this project

set FY = `grep FY proj.info | sed -e "s/FY=//"`

#  At this point one needs a list of files immediately under the above "tar
#   command.  As a starting point, one can use the `vi' command:   !!ls ..
#   to get a list of files in the project's directory and edit out the
#   unneeded ones.  For subdirectories, one can repeat this, e.g.,
#                       !!ls 
#                       !!ls archive
#                       !!ls <directory>
#   (Execute these commands starting with the first "#" line below the
#    `tar' command.  The `vi' command `!!ls' replaces the current line
#    with its output.)
#  Other subdirectories may also have files that need to be archived.
#  After you get the list of files, don't forget to add the subdirectory
#  name (if any) to the beginning of the file name and add a trailing
#  backslash (\) to each file name (except the last one), so the `tar'
#  command gets the entire list of files.
#
#  Get tar directory list for archiving
set dfile = $OFILE.dir
echo " Directory list for file $PROJ.tar" >! $dfile
echo "  Support files for Project $FY-$PROJ $PROJNAME" >> $dfile
set dt = `date`
echo "  Archive created on $dt" >> $dfile
echo " "  >> $dfile
tar tvf $OFILE >> $dfile
