Krista,

Earlier this afternoon Allen spoke to me regarding the new radar altimeter
for the C-130 and its need for a different processing algorithm.  As you know
NIMBUS requires a unique name for this.  He and I decided on HGM232 to reflect
the model number of this new instrument.

I have already added the following to the master VarDB file.

HGM232     Geometric (Radar) Altitude (APN-232)    M

This master VarDB file needs to be exported to your project directory,
something one of our sysadmins needs to do.

Ron,

I can give you the flight dates and data start
and end times, but I do not have the record
count info.  I'll put copies of the data and
other info in your box.

Krista,

Thanks a bunch for your SCMS variable list.   I have looked over your
descriptions, and I already have in the master VarDB list the following:
FXAZIM Radial Azimuth from Fixed Reference      (deg)
FXDIST Radial Distance from Fixed Reference     (kM)
HGM232 Geometric (Radar) Altitude (APN-232)     (M)

We used a UV hygrometer in TOGA-COARE, and except for a leading X (which
should probably be used for SCMS), the variable names all look to be the
same.  I have, in the list below, enumerated these descriptions, which,
if they have not changed, I suggest we use instead of the generic one
you gave to all of them.  Agree?

If possible, can you elaborate a bit more on DFRSTS and DFRSTB?  Is this
associated with some new instrument?  The description is not at all clear
to me.

Also, there are 3 variables starting with XDMA.  Are these from the
same instrument?  If so, why is one called a CN Counter and the others
a Differential Mobility Analyzer?  (Or am I just misinformed?)  :)

As I scanned down the list, I agree that many of the variables (e.g.,
Golden Egg) don't yet belong in the master list.

For your own project's documentation, you may want to provide better
descriptions for all the Ophir variables.  They can be found in the
file:  /home/local/nimbus/src/amlib/xlate/ophir3.c, lines 21-31.
To be true to the format, the words should start with captals.

There are a number of variables (UV hygrometer and Ophir to mention two)
that don't start with an X, even though they are not yet standard RAF 
instruments.  Chris has a problem with changing these names in NIMBUS
later when they do get "approved," so I can understand how the X can be
"forgotten."  I hope, in your QC report, that you mention the experimental
nature of these instruments.

If you have a few minutes, how about giving me more detailed descriptions
for the following variables (unless GENPRO's from TOGA-COARE are OK)?

Name   SCMS Description                   GENPRO's TOGA-COARE Description
------ ---------------------------------- -------------------------------------
DFRSTS Total Reset Digital Input Channel  
DFSTRB Total Strobe Digital Input Channel 
UVCHRF UV Hygrometer Auxiliary Variable   UV Hygrometer Lamp-Off Ref. Detector (cnts)
UVCHSP UV Hygrometer Auxiliary Variable   UV Hygrometer Lamp-Off Signal Detector (cnts)
UVHREF UV Hygrometer Auxiliary Variable   UV Hygrometer H-lamp Reference Detector (cnts)
UVHSMP UV Hygrometer Auxiliary Variable   UV Hygrometer H-lamp Signal Detector (cnts)
UVKRRF UV Hygrometer Auxiliary Variable   UV Hygrometer K-lamp Reference Detector (cnts)
UVKRSP UV Hygrometer Auxiliary Variable   UV Hygrometer K-lamp Signal Detector (cnts)
UVPVOL UV Hygrometer Auxiliary Variable   UV Hygrometer Sample Volume Pressure (mbar)
UVTVOL UV Hygrometer Auxiliary Variable   UV Hygrometer Sample Vol. Temperature (C)

Thanks a bunch for the help.

Ron,

More or less in order, here are my responses:

1)  The UV hygrometer probably should have had an
X in front of all the variable names, but the variable
names in the VarDB file we've been using are "as imported
automatically."  Because those of us involved with
SCMS have gotten used to seeing them the way they
are now, I'm going to leave them that way but will
mention in the documentation that the UVH variables
are experimental.  (A point that I think the PIs
were already aware of.)

2)  DFRSTS and DFRSTB are two housekeeping variables
for the FSSP-100 that Darrel had added for SCMS (since
the capability to record the regular housekeeping variables
had been removed).  Check with Darrel if you want more
details on the definitions.  I wouldn't recommend putting
them in the Master list right now, because I'm not sure
if they're going to become a permanent feature when
the FSSP-100 is used.

3)  All three XDMA variable names and descriptions are
correct as is.  The ultrafine CN counter and DMA are all
part of the same instrument configuration.  We didn't
actually use them during the project, but these are the
names Al Cooper wanted and I'd like to keep them for
the time being.

4)  Thanks for telling me where the OPHIR definitions are...
I was wondering where the heck to find those!

5)  Believe it or not, I had definitions in for all of the
UVH variables before.  (I'd tracked them down in some
documentation Ron S. sent me.)  But, since I wasn't sure
if they were correct or not, I removed them (don't ask
me why, because I'm not sure myself) and put in the
"auxiliary" names.  I'll change them to the TOGA-COARE
definitions in SCMS' VarDB file.  Thanks.

Think that's it.  As I said, check with Darrel on those
two variable names.  But I don't see a problem with using
them as is, since we don't know if they'll become permanent
additions yet.

Krista

Krista,

I will be happy as a clam if you would please change these two definitions in
the 162 VarDB file to imply the FSSP-100.  My suggestions:
   DFRSTS   FSSP-100 Total Reset (Digital)
   DFSTRB   FSSP-100 Total Strobe (Digital)

After looking at your VarDB file, I noticed some unit variations.  I should
publish a list of standard units, so people can use it as a reference.
Well, here it is (from ~nimbus/std.units):

Ron,

It would help me immensely if you could track down
the units for the OPHIR variables we used in SCMS.
Also, there are five variables used in SCMS that
do not show up in the ophir3.c file for which I
need definitions and units.  They are:

ODETOF
ODSIGC
OGAINF
OBBCR
OTDETC

There are 16 OPHIR variables (not counting OAT) for
which I need definitions and/or units.

I have about 20 flights to get through and an MCR
to fix, so if you could track down this information
for me and email it to me so I can change my VarDB
file, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks.

Krista

Krista,

I included the units for the other variables in my previous email.  As for
the others:
I looked at the ADS header definitions (file:  /home/local/include/header.h)
for the Ophir to see if any of these character strings looked like they
described an extant signal.  Curiously, not any help there--the descriptions
I found there were identical to those in the `ophir3.c' file.  The definitions
below are not gospel, but they make sense to me.  I should touch bases with
Allen to verify them.  (I'll send him a copy of this email.)
  
  ODETOF Ophir Detector DC Bias                   Vdc
  ODSIGC Ophir Detector Signal                    Vdc
  OGAINF Ophir Electronic Gain (1, 2 or 3)        none

Thanks.  It occurred to me that ODSIGC and OTDETC may
represent corrected variables.  But we'll see what
Allen says.

Actually, I don't believe you sent me units for
the other ones, but I think I've figured them out
anyway.  Except for OBBCOD and OSMOTR, the first
of which is the blackbody code indicator and the
second of which is the motor speed.  Do you happen
to know what the units are for these two?

Krista,
My first email included units in parentheses after the second description.
If you need them again, please let me know.

Krista,

The units for OBBCOD is "none."  The 4 possibilities are ASCII characters:
    "b" = normal operation
    "z" = detector zero
    "c" = black body full cool cycle
    "h" = black body full heat cycle

I'll have to check with Allen for OSMOTR.  I suppose it could be Vdc or RPM.

the central east coast of Florida.  We are displaying  both raw CP2 data and
cartesianized CP2 data in real time, as well as aircraft tracks.  Not 
surprisingly, the radar rasterizer is having some problems with scan
delineation, given CP2's less-than-stellar housekeeping information. 
Nevertheless, things are relatively stable.  At the PAM base site, packet
files are being converted to netCDF, and five different satellite wavelengths
are being ingested, all in near-real time.  Soon this will also be true 
for ISS data.  Since I leave in a week, I'm trying to make everything simple
to start and stop, so that scientists can do all of the Zebra initialization
themselves.  I'll wean them over the next few days.  

The weather here is varying, but hot and humid are the rule.  *Everything* has
AC here, though, so it isn't bad for those of us who work inside.  I've gotten
to the beach a few times; the one near CP2 is fabulous.  I've also seen
two shuttle launches since arriving.  Bob has probably already given you
complete details of those. :-)  See everybody soon,

Chris

Krista,

Just a reminder that I'm missing SCMS tape R1001 (RF07, 07/27/1995).
There is no rush; I just want to make sure that it eventually gets archived.

Krista,

I'm sorry to tell you that, due to disk saturation, I had to delete some SCMS
raw ADS files from the /home/data directory.  Those I deleted have equivalent
copies archived to the SCD Mass Store System (MSS), so they should be easy to
retrieve when you need them again.  (I hope that your files are equivalent to
the MSS copies and not unique in some way.)

Since all the ADS data have not yet been archived to the MSS, I will not
delete any ADS images that do not have MSS equivalents.  If space again
becomes a problem, I will save your disk files to the MSS, if necessary.

I apologize for not being able to contact you beforehand and having to do
this while you are away.

Here is the list of deleted files:
   162rf1.ads
   162rf2.ads.gz
   162rf3.ads.gz
   162rf4.ads

Krista,

We had another space crunch late this afternoon, and I had to delete some more
of the SCMS raw ADS files from /home/data.  There are MSS copies of all these
deleted files.

I also inadvertently deleted one of your netCDF files.  I hope it isn't too
much work for you to reproduce.

Files deleted in this round:
   162rf5.ads
   162rf5.cdf  (by mistake.  I'm really sorry about this one.)
   162rf10.ads

Ron,

As I told you earlier, final processing of the SCMS data
will now be delayed until I return from ACE-1 in January.
However, in order to give Charlie Knight and the other
SCMS PIs a chance to start looking at the data, I am
going to make the pre-processed 1 Hz netCDF data available
on an "as requested" basis.  I have discussed this with
Paul Herzegh, and we have decided on the following
procedure:

A directory on either one of the RAF machines (chinook
or mistral) or on one of the ATD machines (stout, etc.) will
be designated for which the PIs can have ftp access to the
data.  All of the relevant netCDF files will be placed
there.  However, all requests for this preliminary data
will have to be placed with you, and you will let people
know where the data is located and how to access it.  I would
ask that you keep a complete list of who all requests and
gets data and that it be emphasized that these data are
preliminary and are for the PIs' use ONLY.  (I.e., there
will be NO general public dissemination of these data at
this time.)

Please decide which directory we should use for this purpose
and let me know by Monday, 6 November.  I will be completing
the pre-processing by tomorrow (Fri., 3 Nov.), and I need
to transfer the files to this directory before I meet with
Charlie and Al Cooper next Wednesday.

Thanks.

Krista

P.S.  One factor in selecting a directory to use for this is
that it should have a long lifetime before scrubbing occurs.

Krista,

Your plan looks fine.  Do you have an estimate of the total size of this
data set?  It will help me figure out where to put it.  (If it is fairly
small, I would suggest either a directory within the `~ftp' space or the
`/home/productiondata' directory.)  Do you want access protection put on the
entire set of files or on each data file?  (If the latter, it may be difficult
to have PIs "check-out" an individual file unless I play with permissions on
the fly, something I'd prefer NOT to do.)

Do most of the PIs have access to the SCD Mass Store System (MSS)?  If so,
then I propose we, instead, put the data there (with a reasonable lifetime)
and protect the bitfiles with a READ password.  (Only users having the READ
password can access the bitfiles.)  When I get (and record) a valid request,
I would give s/he the "preliminary" warning and the READ password, asking that
the password not be disseminated.  This protection should be a bit more secure
than just putting the data out here in a directory accessible via ftp.  (If
necessary, I could give each bitfile a different READ password.)  If the MSS
is not available to a PI, I could transfer individual files to our `~ftp'
space and make it available to the PI for a limited time.  What do you think
of this plan?

Finally, some questions.  Are you processing these data using your own login,
or are you using the `nimbus' login?  Are you using any special configuration
files?  Are any of the variables in the netCDF files lacking entries in the
projects VarDB file (meaning that they lack any description about what they
are)?  I ask, because, if, while you are gone, I get questions about how
the data were processed, I'd like to have available as much information as
possible to give answers.  That may save you from being hassled while you
are trying to concentrate on ACE-1.  (It may be prudent for you to make
brief notes and add them to the "notes" file in the 162/Production directory.
(I created one in September into which I put the SCMS variables having no
VarDB descriptions.)

Hi Ron,
	I'm looking for some data from the SCMS project
from last summer.  I hear that the RAW ADS data is already
on the mass store.  Could you give me a listing of the flights
and data files?  I'm also interested in obtaining the netCDF
files that will be put on an ATD machine next week.   I've
talked with Krista and she said that she has some netCDF files
done and that I could play with one of them.  Unfortunately, 
she couldn't put a file on a RAP machine via anonymous ftp.
So, do you have any netCDF files form this project or know
of a way I could get one?

The reason I want all these files (other than I'm a data junkie) 
is that I'm helping Sonia Lasher-Trapp (from Oklahoma) look at 
aircraft data from this project.  I would like to test everything 
on our machines before I install the programs on her machine in OK.  
She will be here today and tomorrow and I would like to show her
the programs when she's here.  

Thanks for your help.  By the way, the phone at x8815 is funny.
It rings for a bit and then goes busy.

Ron,

I'll let you know about the total size when I finish
up the pre-processing tomorrow.

Regarding using the Mass Store, that was, in fact,
suggested by Al Cooper.  However, I've discussed this
with Paul Herzegh, and we are both in agreement that we
are not at all comfortable with placing data on the Mass
Store until they are in final format.  Probably an
argument of semantics to some, I'm sure, but I want to
reserve Mass Store usage until such time as the data are
ready to be released to the public at large.  I'm not at
all sure who has Mass Store access and who doesn't, so
access may be simpler to an ATD machine.  And I guess to
me the level of security would be about the same....
PIs will still have to contact you and get the right
password to get onto our machines or onto stout, etc.
Like I said, semantics, but I'm trying to avoid some
of the broad data dissemination problems we've had in
the past.

I will not have time to make anymore notes regarding the
files before I leave in a couple of weeks, but I've already
documented what I think Charlie and Al Cooper need to know
regarding the preliminary data.  I'll leave the same
preliminary info with you, but all other documentation will
have to wait until January.  I'll also be on email while
in Tasmania, so Charlie and Al or you can contact me there
with any questions.

Just thought of something.....I think I'm going to tag
an extra suffix on all of these netCDF files (".pre" or
something like that) before they're placed in the directory.
That might eliminate some of the confusion regarding these
files versus the final files.

Krista

I put an example SCMS netCDF file on our anonymous ftp server:
   mistral.atd.ucar.edu
The file is   pub/prescms/162rf20.pre
Even though it has no cdf extension, it is a netCDF file.
The "pre" extension is a reminder that these data are PRELIMINARY!

The other data files will be available after Krista and I figure out where to
put them and how to limit their access to the PIs and other authorized users.
I'm trying to convince her to put them on the MSS in a special directory with
a READ password (perhaps a separate one for each file).

Krista,
 
Since you are using your own login name to process these data, each of the
netCDF files already has a "Preliminary Data" warning in its header (assuming
that the user looks at the header information).  I like your idea of giving
these data sets a special name.  The one SCMS data set I made available to
Rachel Ames is in the directory `~ftp/pub/prescms' which I created on
`mistral' and named `162rf20.pre.'  (After she retrieves the file, I will
delete both the file and subdirectory.
 
I still like the idea of the Mass Store.  Our publicly-available data are all
put in predictable paths (/RAF/Year/Pr#/xRT/fltno.cdf).  I can put the data in
a PRELIMINARY subdirectory as I did with the BASE data for Judy Curry.  (When
her final data were ready, I deleted the PRELIMINARY subdirectory and all its
bitfiles.)  I would put these preliminary data in a similar path and add a
READ password to limit access.  (The data on the MSS are available to anyone
only if there is *NO* READ password.  No one can gain access to data protected
with a READ password without knowing the READ password.)
 
A user not having an RAF account and who needs a "special" password to gain
access to these files on an RAF machine also requires Bob or Mike to set up
a special account for him/her.   Instead of doing that, I propose that, after
an approved request from a "foreign" user, a copy of the requested file(s)
would be put in our public-access ftp directory (in an obscure path) for a
short time.  This user would promptly retrieve the file(s), after which they
would be deleted.
 
It would be difficult to prevent any of our users who already have accounts
on RAF machines from accessing these preliminary data files if they are
snooping around our file system.  (I don't know how to password protect a
local user from that data.)  This would be another argument for putting the
files on the MSS.  (Of course, right now, any RAF user can copy the netCDF
files you have in `/home/data' anywhere they want.)
 
Before you go, I need a list of all the PIs and other authorized users.

Ron,

Thanks for getting the data to Rachel.  I tried (unsuccessfully)
yesterday to get it onto RAP's system using anonymous ftp
(which doesn't seem to be working right).

Okay, provided we can guarantee a good level of security on
the Mass Store, let's go ahead and put the preliminary data
there.  (And it eliminates the possibility of outside users
poking around our system.)  I'll tell you where the data is
as soon as the pre-processing is done, and you can take it
from there.

I'll try and get a list of authorized users from Charlie when
I meet with him next week.  If I get too swamped in the next
couple of weeks before I leave (a growing possibility), I'll
have him send it to you.

Krista

Charlie and Al,

We've undergone another revision in our planned location
for storing the preliminary SCMS data files.

After discussing this at some length with Ron Ruth, he and
I have decided that it will probably be best to place these
data on the Mass Store after all.  However, this will not
be done in the standard "general public" fashion.  The files
will be placed in a special directory and will be assigned
a special READ password.  Only individuals who contact Ron
Ruth for this password will be able to get hold of any of
the data.  Ron has, quite correctly, pointed out that this
is actually a safer way to go, as it will keep too many
people from getting onto our system here at RAF and poking
around unnecessarily.

Charlie, I need you to prepare for Ron and me a list of
all the SCMS PIs and data users who will be authorized to
have access to the data.  This will help both Ron and I to
keep track of who all is using the data.

I'll fill you both in on any additional details when I
meet with you next Wednesday.

Krista

Krista:
    I agree with your decision to make preliminary data available to the
SCMS investigators given the circumstances, however it does present some data
management hassles and we don't want to do it routinely.
    Leaving the data on Jeffco computers presents security and space problems.
To avoid this you might want to reconsider putting them on the mass store on 
the Mesa.This might "feel" like the wrong place and too "permanent" but there is
precedent since we did it for the BASE project. Anybody inside of NCAR has just
as easy access to the MS as they do to Jeffco. Maybe easier because they may
already have accounts. By putting them in the proper directory and with the
appropriate "pre-" designation there is no more chance for a mix-up than at
Jeffco. Of course, users outside of NCAR shouldn't be given access to the data
as it can then be spread world wide.
    Also, I would like you to send a formal memo to the PI and Co-PI's
advising them of the preliminary nature of the data and pointing out that they
assume the responsibility of keeping track of the data and destroying or 
returning copies when the final data set is delivered. Also caution them that
analyses or publications on these data may be in error due to the preliminary
nature.

Go ahead and purge away...I've also got them on tape.

Well, certainly we hope you don't die soon, but to be
on the safe side, why don't you also give the password
to Bob?  It wouldn't do any good to give it to me, since
I'm going to be leaving soon.

Thanks for your help!

Krista,

I completed archiving the preliminary data for project 5-162 (SCMS) on the SCD
Mass Store System (MSS).  The MSS directory list (so far as I can construct it
because the MSS is currently down) follows this memo.

All MSS bitfiles in this directory have the same READ password in addition
to the standard RAF WRITE password.  This will prevent anyone not knowing
the passwords from accessing (READ) or modifying (WRITE) the bitfiles.

Right now, I am the only one who knows the READ password.  If you think
that at least someone else should have it, lest I die soon, I'm willing to
share it verbally.

Shall I now purge these data files from /home/data?  They are available to
anyone that can log on to our systems.

Ron,

Just wanted to give you my take on Al Rodi's
request for SCMS raw data.  He asked for this
data first a couple of months ago but then never
called me back after getting Charlie's permission.
Should Al contact you about this, I would echo
Dick Friesen's sentimetns.  MAKE SURE Al has
Charlie Knight's permission, but I do not consider
this a high priority as Al is not (to the best of
my knowledge) an SCMS PI.  Sorry to catch you in
the middle of all this.  (And sorry for the typos,
but this connection is really slow.)

Let me know if you have any questions.

Krista

Al,

The raw ADS and preliminary data for the SCMS project is available only
with Charles Knight's permission.  I just tried calling him, and his voice
mail said he was away until about 10 December.  Nancy Knight answered his
forwarding number, but Charles was not there, so I left your request with
her.  Nancy told me she would relay my request to him, and I should have
an answer sometime tomorrow.  (Nancy didn't think it would be a problem,
but, unfortunately, I have strict orders to follow.)

While you are waiting, you said you wanted data from RF04, RF05 and RF08.
Do you want the raw ADS data or the preliminary NIMBUS netCDF (1 sps) data?
Do you want the data on tape (high- or low-density ExaByte?), or will you be
getting it from the SCD Mass Store System?

Ron,

I already coordinated this with Charlie about a month ago. Too bad he's
out of town. I'm attaching the email I have about this, but most was done
on phone with Charlie.

Anyway, I'm interested in high rate data which has not been done yet and I
will use my nimbus here to process this. Prelim 1 sps netCDF version would
be appreciated for reference purposes.  High density (5 Gbyte) exabyte data
would be preferred.

If raw data is on SCD mass store, I could ftp it, but it would probably
be better to make tape since we have to wait til Charlie gets back anyway (I
hope you can proceed without waiting, however).

Sorry about confusing, but I didn't know Krista was going away and all this
got away from me.

--Thanks, Al.

Al,

Nancy Knight called me early this morning to relay Charlie's approval that you
may have any of the SCMS data you want.  :)

I will have the raw ADS data and preliminary NIMBUS netcdf data for RF04, RF05
and RF08 put on high-density 8mm tape.  I'm not sure yet whether you will get
2, 3 or 4 tapes until the copying is finished.  The ADS data for RF05 on the
SCD Mass Store System (MSS) is split between two bitfiles which need to be
merged together.  The netCDF data will be put in one large tar file.

I case you want to grab the data before the tapes arrive, both the raw
ADS data and the preliminary NIMBUS netCDF data are in the MSS directory
/RAF/1995/162/.  (I'll include a directory list at the end of this message.)
The raw ADS data (COS-blocked) are listed by flight number and tape number.
(For example, ADS data for RF04 would be the MSS bitfile name
/RAF/1995/162/RF04/R0998.)  The 1-sps preliminary NIMBUS netCDF data
(transparent) are stashed via a somewhat obscure MSS directory path/file name
and are protected with a READ password.  (For example, the data for RF04 is
the MSS bitfile name /RAF/1995/162/LRT/PRELIMINARY/162rf4.cdf.)  Please reply
to this message with a date/time when I can call you with the READ password.

Also in this directory are some other bitfiles you should find useful.  The
`README.prescms' bitfile has information about some already-known problems
with the data set.  `prescms.files' has flight-time information.  The three
bitfiles with names ending in `.ps' are PostScript plots with examples of
some of the known problems.

Hello Mr. Ruth,

I am writing to learn how to gain access to the SCMS data listed above.
I recently received a memo from Krista Laursen saying SCMS investigators
should contact you for the password into the Mass Store, and also for
gaining access to the 2D probe data.  I would like this information as
soon as possible.

Thanks for your help.

Sincerely,

Sonia Lasher-Trapp
University of Oklahoma

Dear Sonia,

You are on my list of authorized users, so you know the usage constraints
under which you can obtain these data.  (If not, let me know.)  I am hesitant
to send you the password via email, so if you will be in your office for the
next 15 minutes or so, I can give it to you by phone.  Otherwise, I'll be
back to work on Monday.  If that is not soon enough, you may call me at home
(303)469-0841 and I can give it to you there.  (If no one answers, leave a
message including your phone number(s) and I'll return your call.)

Below is a list of the Mass Store bitfiles pertaining to your request.
The names ending with Rxxxx are the raw ADS data (COS-blocked) which also
contain the PMS-2D data records.  The names in the .../PRELIMINARY/...
path contain the NIMBUS-processed 1 sample-per-second netCDF data.

If you have never used our raw ADS data to obtain the PMS-2D records,
you should probably contact Darrel Baumgardner (darrel@raf.atd.ucar.edu)
to get his software.  (He is currently out of town but may be accessing
his email from time to time.)

If you have never used data in netCDF format, software for it is pubicly
available by anonymous ftp to unidata.ucar.edu (or via web browser
http://unidata.ucar.edu/).

Please let me know if you need more help.

Ron,

Thanks for the quick response.  I don't have a phone in my office, but would
you feel comfortable leaving the password on my answering machine at home?
That way I would have it for this weekend, and won't have to bother you at
your home.

The number is 405-329-7006.

Thanks so much, and have a nice weekend.

Sonia

Hi Ron,

We are anxious to get started on the SCMS data.  According to Krista, we
can get access to the preliminary data on mass store, but we need a
password that you provide.  Could I have the password?

Thanks!

Bob,

It was nice talking with you today.  Now that you have the SCD Mass Store
System (MSS) READ password for the preliminary data, here is the rest of
the information I promised you.  (Note:  only the data in the MSS bitfile
path /RAF/1995/162/LRT/PRELIMINARY is protected by the READ password.)

The bitfile:
    /RAF/1995/162/LRT/PRELIMINARY/README.prescms
    contains Krista Laursen's comments on problems and limitations regarding
    the preliminary data set.

The bitfile:
    /RAF/1995/162/LRT/PRELIMINARY/prescms.files
    catalogs the netCDF data contents (bitfile name, flight date, time periods).

The netCDF data long bitfile names are of the form:
    /RAF/1995/162/LRT/PRELIMINARY/162rfnnx.cdf
    where:  1995 = is the fiscal year for this RAF project
             162 = the RAF project number associated with SCMS
              nn = Flight number
               s = Flight segment (caused by time gaps in the acquired data)
 
The raw ADS data long bitfile names are of the form:
    /RAF/1995/162/tFnns/Rxxxx
    where:  t = Flight type = F (for Ferry)
                              R (for Research)
                              T (for Test)
           nn = Flight number
            s = Flight segment (If data set is larger than maximum bitfile
                                size--presently 400,000,000 bytes, it is
                                split into segments using the same tape
                                number.  If a flight uses more than one tape,
                                segments will show different tape numbers.)
        Rxxxx = RAF-assigned data tape number
                                  
Below is the MSS directory list for both the raw ADS and preliminary
processed netCDF data.

SCD has put together a library of Fortran/C routines which allow you to
read and write Cray style datasets (along with numeric conversion) on IEEE
machines.  If you would like to install this library on your local machines,
grab the tar from anonymous ftp:
 
    ftp ftp.ucar.edu
    ...
    binary
    get upload/ncaru.tar ncaru.tar
 
This library is similar to the ncaru library installed on the SCD
cluster.  (The cluster ncaru library contains some additional routines.)
 
Below is the top level README from the distribution.  If you have
any questions about this library, please contact Pete Morreale
(morreale@ncar.ucar.edu).

---------------- start of README --------------------------------
 
This is the source distribution for the Cray file conversion library "ncaru"
(NCAR Utilities).  This library contains Fortran and C bindings to routines
for reading and writing Cray style datasets from non-Cray platforms.
 
Description
-----------
The library contains the following user entry points:
       crayblocks() - Sets the size of the library buffer.
       crayback()   - Moves back a record in a Cray file.
       crayclose()  - Closes a Cray file.
       crayopen()   - Opens a Cray blocked or unblocked file.
       crayread()   - Reads data from a Cray file.
       crayrew()    - Rewinds a Cray file.
       crayweof()   - Writes an EOF to a Cray file.
       crayweod()   - Writes an EOD to a Cray file.
       craywrite()  - Writes data to a Cray file.
 
In addition, a number of numeric conversion routines are also included.
These can be used indirectly through the crayread() and craywrite()
routines, or directly from Fortran/C.  These routines convert to/from Cray
64bit values only.
       ctodpf()  - Cray to IEEE double precision.
       ctospf()  - Cray to IEEE single precision (floating point).
       ctospi()  - Cray to IEEE single precision (integer).
       dptocf()  - IEEE double precision (floating) to Cray.
      *dptoci()  - IEEE double precision (integer) to Cray
                   (For RS6000 -qautodbl=dblpad).
       sptocf()  - IEEE single precision (floating) to Cray.
       sptoci()  - IEEE single precision (integer) to Cray.
* This routine does not support the xlf version 3.1 INTSIZE=8 option.
   See the man page.
 
Finally, three Cray blocked file utilities are included.  These are:
       cosfile    - Examines a blocked file and reports record sizes.
       cosconvert - Strips Cray blocking from a file.
       cossplit   - Splits a multifile Cray blocked dataset into
                    separate files.

Features
--------
The library has the following features:
 
    1) Ability to read and write both Cray unblocked or blocked
        datasets.
    2) Automatic numeric conversion between Cray single precision data
        formats and IEEE (both single and double precision) formats
        during crayread() or craywrite().  You can also call the numeric
        conversion routines directly yourself.
    3) Ability to specify a library buffer of an appropriate size.
        This can save a significant amount of system CPU time during I/O
        to large files.
    4) Full BACKSPACE and REWIND implementations which mimic Cray Fortran.
    5) The ability to append to the end of the last file in a
        Cray dataset.  (See crayopen(3))
    6) Full and partial record operations for blocked files.  Regardless
        of the requested number of words, crayread always returns at the
        next record.
       This means that you can read a single word, and move the record
        pointer to the next record.  Useful to skip records without
        having a large unused buffer lying about.
       You can also request a larger number of words than the actual
        record contains, and only the actual number of words in the record
        are transferred.   Usful for 'mystery' files.
    7) Both Fortran and C interfaces are documented in the man pages.
        The C interface is admittedly kludgy.  Basically, you are calling
        the Fortran interface (which means you have to pass in pointers
        to everything).  Unfortunantely, the Fortran interface was
        established first and we choose not to add additional routines to
        make the C interface less cumbersome.
 
Porting
-------
The library has been ported to Suns, CM-5 (essentially a Sun), an SGI, and IBM
RS6000 machines.  We'd be interested in mods for ports to other platforms as
well.  See the acknowledgements section below.
 
Building
--------
NOTE: for building on the Suns, you will need to modify the
      Makefile in the "lib" directory to include executing ranlib
      once the archive is built.  See the comments in ./lib/Makefile
 
The library is currently set up to install in /usr/local/{bin,lib,man}
for the utilities, library and man pages.  If you wish to change the
locations, you will need to modify the makefiles in each of the source
directories.  Don't worry, the makefiles are extremely trivial.
 
To build, move to the top of the source tree and type:
    % make clean
    % make
 
To install:  (in this directory)
    % make install
    % make install.man
 
Testing
-------
cd to the tests directory and look at the README.
A test program for the Cray I/O routines is built when you build the
distribution.  There are shells available for testing the numeric
conversion routines.
 
Acknowledgements
----------------
This distribution is the result of several people's efforts.  Tom Parker
wrote the original COS utilities, cosfile, cosconvert, and cossplit for
the Cray.  Chuck D'ambra write the original numeric conversion routines
for a utility his division uses.  Craig Ruff wrote the original Cray blocking
routines.  Dan Anderson and Greg Woods originally combined both the
conversions and Cray routines into a single package.  The author took
the whole mess and added backspacing, wrote man pages, optimized, added
other enhancements, and rewrote the COS utilities using the new library.
Comments, enhancements, etc, are welcome.
 
We have moved gigabytes of data using these routines on our IBM
cluster.  Hope you find them useful at your site.

Hello Ron,

I'm Charlie Knight's student, working at the University of Oklahoma.  You helped
me access some SCMS preliminary data a couple of months ago.  Anyway, I have a 
"general exam" coming up in mid-February, and some of my committee members want
me to have statements ready about the instrument errors from the SCMS aircraft  
data I'll be using for my project.

Now I know the official SCMS data set has not been released, and so the errors 
specific to this project are probably not known yet.  Would you perhaps have 
some quantitative information on errors *generally* associated with the FSSP 
data, the CCN data, the liquid water content measurements, and the 1D and 2D 
probes?  I already have a RAF document by Darrel, Bulletin #24, called "Airborne
Measurements for Cloud Microphysics".  This gives good descriptions of the
possible errors, but not a lot of quantitative information.  I need numbers
that I can call "error bars", to quote my one committee member.

Thanks in advance for any help you can provide!

Sonia

Dick,

I just received the following email message, and I'm not sure I have the time
to spend digging up all the information she wants.  Do you have a suggestion
how to quickly get her this information?  Should I forward this to Krista,
and let her deal with it?  I don't know about Krista's workload right now.

I hate to saddle you with this since Sonia wrote to me, but I feel you

Ron, Krista,
I can respond to the PMS related questions. She will need to contact Jim Hudson
directly at DRI to get information on CCN, unless she is talking about
CN, not CCN, in which case we can send her Cindy's technote.

Sonia,
Ron asked Krista and me to respond to your questions concerning measurement
uncertainties. You specifically ask for more information on PMS FSSP
and OAP probes, the King LWC probe, and CCN. I am sending you some literature
that will answer most of your questions with respect to the PMS and LWC
probes, but you will need to contact Dr. Jim Hudson at DRI for more
information on CCN. If you were actually referring to the RAF CN measurement,
I'll send you the technote on that instrument that describes the measurement
uncertainties.

Regards,
Darrel

Sonia,

    The one paper on the OAPs does not give a good quantitative number on the
measurement uncertainty.  Unfortunately, we haven't yet done a really thorough
uncertainty analysis on either the OAP 1Ds or 2Ds. It is not a simple task,
because these uncertainties are very dependent upon the type of particles and
the size distribution.  I would give a very rough estimate of something like
15-20% uncertainty in the measurement of water drop size and a similar
uncertainty in the measurement of their concentration.  These errors double
when measuring ice crystals of asymetric shapes.  On the small size end, the 
uncertainties are primarily due to the dependence of the optical depth of
field on the particle size and our uncertainty in knowing this exact number.
On the large end the problem is sampling statistics.

    Hope these references help.  Feel free to call or email with additional
questions.  I will be away from JEFCO from January 17 - February 4 but will
be available via email except from January 17-26.

Darrel

Krista,

Just thought I'd update you on the recipients of the SCMS preliminary
data password, as of now.  (This list is duplicated in the file:
/home/local/proj/162/Production/recipients.)

Ilga Paluch, MMM -- password given 16 November 1995
Alfred R. Rodi, U of Wyoming -- password given 29 November 1995
   Raw and netCDF data shipped to Al on high-density ExaByte tape
   (Received by him on 12 December 1995)
Sonia Lasher-Trapp, U of Oklahoma -- password given 1 December 1995
Bob Rauber, U of Illinois, Urbana/Champlaign -- password given 5 December 1995

Al,

Now that you have the SCD Mass Store System (MSS) READ password for the
preliminary data, here is the rest of the information I promised you.
(Note:  only the data in the MSS bitfile path /RAF/1995/162/LRT/PRELIMINARY
is protected by the READ password.)

The bitfile:
    /RAF/1995/162/LRT/PRELIMINARY/README.prescms
    contains Krista Laursen's comments on problems and limitations regarding
    the preliminary data set.

The bitfile:
    /RAF/1995/162/LRT/PRELIMINARY/prescms.files
    catalogs the netCDF data contents (bitfile name, flight date, time periods).

The netCDF data long bitfile names are of the form:
    /RAF/1995/162/LRT/PRELIMINARY/162rfnnx.cdf
    where:  1995 = is the fiscal year for this RAF project
             162 = the RAF project number associated with SCMS
              nn = Flight number
               s = Flight segment (caused by time gaps in the acquired data)
 
The raw ADS data long bitfile names are of the form:
    /RAF/1995/162/tFnns/Rxxxx
    where:  t = Flight type = F (for Ferry)
                              R (for Research)
                              T (for Test)
           nn = Flight number
            s = Flight segment (If data set is larger than maximum bitfile
                                size--presently 400,000,000 bytes, it is
                                split into segments using the same tape
                                number.  If a flight uses more than one tape,
                                segments will show different tape numbers.)
        Rxxxx = RAF-assigned data tape number
                                  
Below is the MSS directory list for both the raw ADS and preliminary
processed netCDF data.

Ron,

I need to retrieve a couple of the netCDF files that
I generated for SCMS and that you archived on the Mass
Store for me.  msget is not finding them in the RAF
directory.  Can you tell me how I need to request these
files?  I.e., how did you name the netCDF files, and are
they in a special directory?

Thanks.

Krista

Krista,

Since these files have the names you gave them rather than the standard names
I use (a good idea, since they then act less official), you need to retrieve
them using a standard "nrnet" command rather than using my "msget" scripts.

To retrieve a netCDF file, refer to the following example for RF01:
   nrnet msget $MIGS/162rf01.cdf  l df=tr \
     r flnm=/RAF/1995/162/LRT/PRELIMINARY/162rf1.cdf r=<READ>

See me for the <READ> password.

Ron,

I anticipate that, within the next couple of days, I will
begin the final (production) processing of the SCMS data.
Before I start this process, I wanted to pass the file
name conventions I've been planning on using past you to
make sure that these will be acceptable for recovering
the files from the Mass Store at a later date.  (I.e., 
will they work with you msget scripts?)  I've decided
on the following:


1)  Low-rate (1 Hz) data -- 162RFxx.cdf (xx = 03, 12, etc.)

2)  High-rate data -- 162RFxxhr.cdf

3)  2D data only (stripped off using "dnl2d") -- scms2dxx


Please let me know ASAP what your thoughts are regarding
these naming conventions.  Thanks.

Krista

Ron,

I was just perusing some documentation your wrote, and I
noticed that I should be using the convention "162RFxxH.cdf"
for the high-rate files I generate.  I'll make sure this
gets done.

I would like to sit down with you either tomorrow or
Wednesday to go over a few of the production processing
procedures.  I think understand all of the necessary steps,
but I want to make sure that I'll be executing all of the
necessary steps in the proper sequence.

Paul,

I wanted to make sure I am keeping you in the loop regarding
the processing of the SCMS data.  At present, it is my
intent to begin the production processing of the SCMS this
week, hopefully within the next couple of days.  While I
cannot say specifically when all of the processing will be
completed, it is my goal to have the final data set and
project documentation ready for distribution by the end of
February.

I have, after consultation with Charlie Knight and Al Cooper,
decided to make one modification to the data processing plan.
Rather than processing high-rate data for SCMS only on an
"as requested" basis (as was stated in our initial feasibility
study for the project), it has been decided to go ahead and
process and release high-rate data for all of the research
flights at this time.  It has become increasingly apparent
that the high-rate data will be of equal (if not greater)
importance to the PIs, and it seems to me that it will save
not only the investigators but RAF time in the future if
high-rate data are made available from the very beginning.
(I.e., we won't have to repeatedly go back and re-process
data at high-rate as requests come in; it will all be there
to begin with.)  Under consultation with Darrel and Al, a
decision will be made as to which variables should be processed
at high-rate.

I believe that is all for now.  I will keep you informed as
progress is made with the final processing.

Krista

Krista,

Thanks for all your emails regarding your plans for production processing of
SCMS data.  In case you have not reviewed it yet, please refer to the file
"procedure.brief" in the `~nimbus' home directory.

I hope you can follow most of the procedures there, because it will help
to document the data set and allow a much easier job of reprocessing, should
that ever be necessary.

I have no objection to doing high-rate processing on the entire project's
data.  The one stumbling block we must avoid, at present, is a 400 Mbyte
file size limit imposed by the SCD Mass Store System (MSS).  With this being
an Electra project, I don't think it will be a problem, but we need to check
the netCDF file size of longest flight.

I'd like to meet with you before you actually begin production processing
of the data so we can "be on the same page."  (After our hallway discussion
and looking at my schedule, Wednesday morning, say after 9:00, looks fine.)

See you then.

Dear Krista and Darrell:
	Thanks very much for the PVM cloud data from flight 5. Your sent 
me five cloud passes named hrlwc*.asc, where * = a,b,c,d,e. Would you be 
so kind and tell me which "cloud pass #", as labeled by Darrell, each of 
those files applies to. You note that I should work with Ron Ruth on 
future data requests, I understand, we're all very busy and committed to 
our own agendas. At the risk of you saying no, I will ask you for just a 
bit more ASCII data. Can you send me the FSSP concentration vs time for 
the cloud pass corresponding to your file hrlwce.asc? This would be very 
much appreciated, and I promise it would be my last request outside of 
the MASS STORAGE. You can E-Mail this tiny amount of FSSP data to me. If 
this request is too much of a time burden for you, would you be so kind and 
pass this request on to Ron Ruth.
	Update on your new PVM: No, we do not have full payment for this 
instrument. We have, however received payment for the rental of our 
in-house PVM used during SCMS. The full payment will be due 30 days 
only after we deliver an instrument to you. We are in the middle of building 
new PVM-100A instruments, and estimate (with 90% certainty) that they will 
be completed on 31 March. We plan to ship yours at that time, baring 
unforseen delays. We will keep you updated.
Best regards,
Hermann

Ron,

I just ran xtv on both of the data tapes for SCMS flight
FF1 and was able to read the headers for both no problem.
So, given this information and Chris' response yesterday
to your question about my use of the PF designation, the
only things I can come up with at this point are that
a) something got messed up while the tapes were being
copied to the Mass Store, or b) something got screwed up
during the transfer of the files down here from the Mass
Store.  (Although, I got no error messages from MIGS when
I brought the various file segments down.)

So, I propose the following.  I'm going to try and bring
the two file segments containing the headers down again and
see if I'm able to read them.  If I can't, then I will probably
ask you to re-archive this tapes to the Mass Store for me
and we'll take it from there.

Krista

Looks like a good plan.  Have you tried running NIMBUS using the tapes
I would archive?

I submitted the job to rename the first of the 4 MSS bitfiles for SCMS FF01.
I have no confirmation that the rename has yet taken place, and I must now
leave for the weekend, so I guess I'll finish up the task early next week.

Bummer, this could certainly put a crimp in things.  I don't
know if this has any bearing on why the SCMS RF7 tape failed
to archive, but remember that it's a corrupt tape past about
50 minutes into the flight.  However, an EOF marker seems
to have been written before the tape went bad, so maybe that's
no explanation whatsoever.

Keep me posted of how things progress.

Krista,

I finally succeeded in renaming the MSS bitfiles for FF01.  (The MSS is really
busy these days, since that job, in the past, would take only a few minutes.)
They now have the names:
     /RAF/1995/162/FF01A/R0993
     /RAF/1995/162/FF01B/R0993
     /RAF/1995/162/FF01C/R0993
     /RAF/1995/162/FF01D/R0994
You may freely process that flight now.  I also updated the RAF archived
bitfile list, so the "msget..." scripts will work with them, too.

Please be aware that NIMBUS is smart but dumb when it comes to combining disk
file segments together.  If you retrieve all four of these files from the MSS
and process the flight from the beginning, NIMBUS will think all four files
are for the same flight segment.  To keep that from happening when I processed
the VORTEX data, I renamed the ADS file for the second data set so NIMBUS
would not recognize it as a contiguous segment.  My example:
     $MIGS/887rf07a.ads
     $MIGS/r887rf07b.ads
With the "r" in front of the second file, NIMBUS didn't try to read it in,
so I could process it separately.  You can devise a scheme like this or just
process the first three sections of FF01 before bringing down the fourth.
(The usual occurs with the netCDF file names; you must rename initial segments
before processing subsequent ones.)

While I was mopping up that job, I discovered another bit of unfinished
business:  FF04 (tape # R1028).  The tail end of the tape (the last 12,727
records) has yet to be archived.  Back in October I made 4 separate job
submissions (most of which were run at least twice for a total of 11 attempts)
to archive that last chunk of data; none of them was successful.  Thinking
that something might be wrong with the tape itself, I had it brought back to
Jeffco (including the others that completed successfully) with the intention
of analyzing it.  Because everyone had gone to ACE, I didn't have a good idea
how to do that, so I put it aside (waiting for people to return) and
subsequently forgot about it.

So, there are 30,000 records (687.300663 Mbytes) archived in two bitfiles
(.../FF04A/R1028 and .../FF04B/R1028).  If you intend to process that
flight, I need to find a way to archive the missing records.  (The short-term
alternative is to process the flight using the raw tape itself, which may
be the most practical.)  I still want to archive the rest of the data, so
I appreciate any suggestions you can give me.

Krista,

Apparently the tape copy for RF07 has bad stuff after the data error occurred,
not an EOF.  When I tried to stage it, I specified one file to be read instead
of a fixed number of records.  By so doing, the data overflowed an `msimport'
buffer, and the job died.  I will resubmit the job to read 2983 records.  (You
told me that there were 2984, but I don't really know the status of the last
one, and I want to be sure to archive as much as I can.)  If you can guarantee
me that the last record is good, I'll bump the value in the job request.

Krista & Allen,

So far, no good!  Because you, Krista, are now in production on SCMS, I
thought it important to first stage the remaining SCMS raw ADS tape (RF07,
R1001) to the SCD Mass Store System (MSS) and use it as a test case for the
large block of tapes that ACE has.  My first try failed with very little
explanation contained in the MSS log file that the job returned.

I emailed the MIGS "import" job request command and the MSS log file to
Kathy Fryberger, the SCD "import" expert, and am awaiting a reply before
proceeding again.  I was hopeful that things would go more smoothly now,
but, apparently that will not be the case.

I hope Kathy can give me some ideas and/or pointers to ease the situation.
It may be that the switch to the new MSCP (Mass Store Control Processor)--
tentatively scheduled for 5 February--will have to occur before tape staging
will work reliably.  (I wonder if even that will really change anything.)
Oh, well, gotta remain optimistic!

Krista,

The first 2984 raw ADS data records for RF07 (ExaByte tape Copy R1001) have
now been archived to the SCD Mass Store System.  I had Sue Ellen return the
tape to me here at Jeffco, and I have put it into the master archive storage

Krista,

Sorry for your trouble; I have not gotten the latest version of RAF's MSS
local master bitfile directory.  I made a manual entry for RF07 in the master
directory, so you should now be able to submit the job to retrieve the file.

Today is also cut-over day for the new MSS Control Processor, so the MSS has
been down since 7:00 a.m. today.  I just found out that the MSS is now back
up after completing the cut-over, so your job now has a much better chance
of completing successfully.

If you have any other problems, please let me know.

Ron,

I am in the process of creating the 2D data files for the
SCMS flights.  The filename convention I have adopted is 
162rfxx.2d, where xx is the research flight number.

At present, these files are sitting in the /home/data directory,
and so as not to tie up space on the disk, I would like to
have them archived to the Mass Store as soon as possible.
Can you begin this process as soon as you are able and let
me know what the directory path on the Mass Store will be?
(I guess something like 162/2D would probably work.)

I will probably work on processing these files in groups and
will notify you via email when a group is ready to be archived
to the Mass Store.

Thanks for your help.

Krista

Okay, but just don't let it happen again.  Just kidding....
thanks for taking care of the problem for me.

The fact that the MS has been down also explains why two
of my requested files have not been pulled down yet.

Krista,

The standard bitfile name convention for the PMS-2D data on the MSS
is /RAF/$YEAR/$PROJ/PMS2D/$fltno.

Files to be archived:
   /home/data/162rf01.2d
   /home/data/162rf02.2d
   /home/data/162rf03.2d
   /home/data/162rf04.2d
   /home/data/162rf05.2d

I'll start the archiving within minutes.  (Without writing a special new
script, one cannot retrieve these files using my standard "msget" routines.)

Krista,

Too late!  I already submitted jobs to do the whole bunch of them.  I'll see
how long it takes to get them transferred.  I expect the MSS to be quite busy
because of the down time this morning.  If RF05 isn't complete when the MSS
transfer takes place, I can just resubmit it again later.

P.S.  I hope none of these files exceeds 400,000,000 bytes.  If so, it will
       need to be split into pieces before I can archive it.

P.S.  You can get the file sizes just by doing an ls command
on them in /home/data.

Krista,

You may safely remove RF01-RF04.  I have to redo RF05, and I will
submit that job with the ones for RF06-RF10.

Kathy Fryberger has some challenges with the new MSCP; I had a couple of
ACE-1 jobs that quit early.  It appears that your PMS-2D files archived OK,
because I checked the MSS directory and found proper entries for them.

I'll let you know when the next wave has been archived.

Krista,

Looks like your data transfer from tape to `162rf05.2d' has completed.
I don't think the MSS has yet to request that file, so it looks like
all is OK.  After the MSS copy, I'll compare file sizes to make sure
all the data were transferred.

Krista,

I will start the archive process for PMS-2D on RF11-RF20.

The tape for FF04 is at ML to archive the last 4937 records that
never made it in my prior attempts.  Do we have a conflict here?

Okay, the 2D files for FF01 (162ff01a.2d and 162ff01b.2d) are
ready to be placed on the Mass Store.

Note that the file for FF01a is quite long.

The data for SCMS (162) PMS-2D data for RF11-RF20 have been archived to
the SCD Mass Store System.  I'd say it completed in record time!

You hit RF19 pretty close to the limit!

I await the Ferry flights.  I have no word yet on the archive of the last

trying.

FYI, these PMS-2D bitfiles are protected by a WRITE password (as are all

Krista,

I cannot archive file 162ff01a.2d as is; it must be split into pieces no
larger than 400,000,000 bytes.  I doubt that you have any data in the
file 162ff01b.2d, since it is zero length.  In fact, right now, the
`/home/data' space is exhausted, so the program probably died without
telling you the disk was full, and that may have happened with 162ff01a.2d.
How about deleting the files I already archived to make room.  (I also need
room there for my Mass Store log files.  I just lost the log file for my FF04
try.  I will see if it was successful by looking at the latest MSS directory
listing.)

Nope, dnl2d does not allow you to specific time intervals or
subdivide files.

Well, I needed something to do anyway (I've been soooo bored...),
so why don't I move the original file over to productiondata and
subdivide it into two segments using dd, as you've suggested.
What do you want me to call the two segments, for archiving
purposes?

I deleted and started over because I wanted to make sure I'd

Those name conventions sound fine.  I'll let you know when
the files are ready.

Okay, the 2D files for FF01 are finally ready to go up to
the Mass Store.  The file names are:

162ff01a1.2d
162ff01a2.2d
162ff01b.2d

All are less than 400 Mb in size.

Krista,

Perhaps you misunderstood me.  I cannot archive the file 162ff01a.2d until it
is broken up into files that are less than 400,000,000 bytes each.  It is now
just too large for me to handle.

Does the program which strips off the 2D data have any kind of time interval
you can enter?  If not, then I'm not sure how to handle this situation.
I would expect you want to break up the file on an even record boundary.
The utility `dd' can do this work if the exact size of one of the 2D records
(28812 bytes) is specified.  Here is an example command line:
  dd if=162ff01a.2d of=162ff01a1.2d bs=28812 count=13383

The only hitch in this is that we need the available disk space to do the
conversion, since there needs to be room for both files.  Actually,
there is room in /home/productiondata.

How should we proceed?

Krista,

You actually don't have to move the original.  If you are logged in
as `nimbus,' just specify an output file using the absolute path
/home/productiondata.  It saves a step, and, since both disks are
mounted to mistral (so you want to run `dd' from mistral, too) you
should not pay a penalty for network transfers.  (I see that you
have already moved it, so disregard the above.)

As to new output file names, I would suggest:
    162ff01a1.2d
    162ff01a2.2d
Since the raw ADS data on the MSS are in 4 chunks (3 from one tape and one
from another), I could put these on the MSS in a similar way.  That way,
they would be:
    162ff01a1.2d --> /RAF/1995/162/PMS2D/FF01A
    162ff01a2.2d --> /RAF/1995/162/PMS2D/FF01B
The data from the other tape would be:
    162ff01b.2d --> /RAF/1995/162/PMS2D/FF01C

Does that work for you or would it be too confusing?

I just got a successful completion message for the raw ADS data archive to the
MSS of the last portion of SCMS FF04 (R1028).  I will ask Sue Jensen to return
the tape to me so you can strip off the PMS-2D data.

Krista,

For just FF04C (last section of R1028) I submitted 7 jobs to the MSS via
MIGS.  When initial failures occured for them, the operators restarted
the jobs a couple times, so the MSS saw more job submissions than I sent.
Success occurred on the 15th try.  (To archive the entire tape I sent a
total of 11 jobs via MIGS, but the MSS saw a total of 24 submissions, not
a very good track record.)

I really hope the new MSS Control Processor can be of help.  It's been a
real struggle (both for SCD and me) jockeying these tapes.

Ron,

In the /home/productiondata directory are two 2d files for
SCMS FF04.  They are called:

162ff04a.2d
162ff04b.2d

Both are less than 400 Mb in size and are ready to go up to
the Mass Store.  Let me know when they're archived so I can
remove them.

Thanks.

Ron,

I pulled down the ADS images for SCMS RF19 (in two parts, a and b)
and RF20 this a.m. to do the 1 Hz processing, and it turns out
that the header records for all three of the images I pulled
down are bad.  I got no error messages from gwuser when the files
were being moved, so I wonder if something went wrong when the
tapes for RF19 and 20 were archived to the Mass Store.  Can
you please check into this problem for me?  I need to get these
flights processed.

Thanks.

Krista,

Have you tried reading these data from the original or copied ExaByte tapes?
(They are in Mary Ann's office in the tan cabinets.)  You may want to try that
to make sure that they are OK.  I have never before had a situation where the
Mass Store added more bytes to a record than were on a tape.  Personally, I
would think the tapes are hosed also.

Did you use an "msget" script to retrieve these files?  (I suspect you did.)

If the MSS data are no good, I would need to rearchive those data once I
verified that the tapes themselves are OK.

You could try bringing the bitfiles down again, but it looks to me, from what
you describe, like I should re-archive them.

I'm trying to bring down RF19 again, but I think you'll 
need to re-archive them both.  I just started processing
RF19 from tape and had no problems.

I don't know why it worked this time, but I just pulled down
the ADS files for RF19 from the Mass STore and it is now
processing fine.  I'll try RF20 again, also.

So, it appears that there was a glitch in pulling the files
down from the MS.

I need to process FF04 for SCMS but can't find the final
ADS tape segment on the Mass Store (presumably, ff04c).  It's
not in the RAF directory....can you please add it so I can

Ron,

I have completed processing the 1 Hz data for all of the SCMS
ferry and research flights and am now running Darrel's skeleton
programs on them to generate the correct PMS probe data.  However,
before I merge the probe subset files and original files together,
I would like to have the 1 Hz original files archived to the
Mass Store.  (A "cover my tail" action, in case something gets
hosed during use of ncmerge.)

So, can you please archive the 1 Hz files in /home/productiondata
to the Mass Store for me?  The file names follow the usual convention,
162ff01a.cdf, 162ff01b.cdf, 162rf01.cdf, etc.  Note that these are
NOT the final 1 Hz cdf files....they contain the incorrect PMS
data.  So, they shouldn't go in the final LRT directory.  Let me
know the name of the directory you will be putting them in.  As
we discussed, users do not need to know that this directory even
exists...it's just there for backup purposes.  Also, I will be
asking you to archive the probe data subset netCDF files after they've
all been generated.  Same story, the users don't need to know that
the directory containing these files even exists.  Just let me 
know the name of the directory where they'll be stored.

Thanks for your help on this.  Oh, the total number of netCDF files
in productiondata that need to be archived is 23.

Krista

Krista,

I have submitted jobs to archive all those files to the Mass Store System
with the following bitfile naming convention:
   /RAF/1995/162/ORIGINAL/LRT/fltno
   where:  fltno = normal naming convention (RF01, FF01A, etc.)

I'll let you know when all of them have finished.  You can then rename
them, so your final production files will end up with the same name.
(My archive script works better that way.)

For the probe subset, I intend to use the naming convention:
   /RAF/1995/162/ORIGINAL/PMS-1D/fltno

Do you see any need to put READ passwords on these?  They are readable by
anyone, but I don't intend to publicize a path other than our standard
production output.

No, I don't really see a need to put a read password on them.  Unless
someone is real proficient at poking around the Mass Store directories,
I don't see where they would get into trouble with accessing the
wrong files.

Krista,

The normal way to do a merge is to read two files and put the result
in a third.  What I'm saying is that, when you are finished, have that
third file name be the same name as what the production files now have
(e.g, 162rf12.cdf).  (It's really no big deal, as I can realistically
handle any name convention you give me.)

I noticed some executable "skel" programs in the directory
`/home/local/proj/162/Production.'  If these are used to produce the final
production data sets, I want to archive the source files for them.  (In
fact, my goal is to archive all files associated with production processing
that will allow us to reproduce the production data set.  That includes
Darrel's program[s] used to produce the "correct" PMS data.)

So if you have files scattered about, how about creating appropriate
subdirectories in the ...162/Production directory and stuffing the files in
them (owned by "nimbus," of course).  Then when I archive them, they will all
be in one general location.  (I archive the entire NIMBUS processor, too, so
you need not worry about it unless you had Chris generate a "special" one just
for this project.)

I assume you want to wait until the final production data sets are archived
to the MSS before we delete that special "preliminary" priveleged data set.

Great, thanks.  I'll go ahead and move my temporary merged (i.e.
final) netCDF files back to the conventional file names when
Darrel and I have determined they're okay.

REgarding the skel files, I've already created two appropriate
subdirectories in /Production containing the appropriate binaries.
Haven't moved all of the other files over yet....will do that
when I'm done with all this other stuff.

No, please don't remove the preliminary files until all of the
final 1 Hz files are ready (should probably be ready by tomorrow).

Ron,

The final 1 Hz netCDF files (i.e., the LRT files) are ready
to go up to the Mass Store.  I've moved them all back to the
standard file names (162rfxx.cdf, 162ffxx.cdf), and they
are still sitting in /home/productiondata.  Can you please
transfer them up there?

Also, the skeleton processed subset files are also ready to
go up to the Mass Store.  The name convention for these files
is 162rfxxprb.cdf or 162ffxxprb.cdf, and all of the files are
sitting in /home/productiondata, as well.  Can you move these
up to the MS?  These are the ones that should go in your PMS 1D
subdirectory.

Please let me know when all of these have files have been
successfully archived so I can remove them from /home/productiondata
and make room for the high-rate files.  Thanks!

Krista

P.S.  I'm working on the data documentation notebooks in parallel
with this final bit of processing so as to expedite this.  Can
you go ahead and print up the bitfile logs for the 1 Hz and 2D
files you've already archived so that I have those ready?  Thanks.

Krista,

I started archiving the final LRT netCDF files as well as the skeleton-created
PMS-1D files.  I will print out a copy of the taplog file (MSS Bitfile Log)
for the standard LRT data.

Is it OK to just copy the MSS directory list of the bitfiles for the PMS-2D
data instead of making up something special like I do for the netCDF data?

Great!  Thanks a lot, Ron.  I'll go ahead and get them off the
disk.

One more item I forgot to ask you about.  I guess you normally
prepare a netCDF instruction sheet to go into the project notebooks
(or maybe this is a standard document for every project).  At
any rate, I will need two copies of this for the two SCMS notebooks.

Thanks!

Hi Ron,

I've started on the SCMS high-rate processing, and I've got
a couple of quick questions.

First, the standard netCDF name format for high-rate files
is 162rfxxh.cdf, correct?

Second, I just processed RF01, and at high-rate, it is not
processing the same time interval is for the low-rate file.
At low-rate, nimbus processes 15:01:20-17:54:51, but at
high-rate, it only processes 15:01:32-17:54:03.  Is this
standard behavior for nimbus to drop several seconds of the
data at high-rate?

Krista

Forgot to mention that I know the high-rate/low-rate time
differences aren't due to running out of disk space in
/home/productiondata, because the disk is presently at
only 47% and I'm having no trouble processing another flight
and adding it to the disk.

Krista,
This is correct; however, NIMBUS doesn't have an automatic-naming
feature for high-rate data and, instead, will give the output file
the "low-rate" name (unless Chris made a recent software change).
You will have to rename it yourself after processing has finished.

To work properly, NIMBUS's multi-rate filter needs an array of data (12
seconds worth) before and after the current time.  Therefore, some data
must be ignored both at the beginning and at the end.  So the answer to
your question is:  yes, this is standard behavior.

You know, after I emailed you, I actually thought about this a
little bit and started wondering if it didn't have something
to do with array sizes.  Thanks for clearing this up for me...
I was worried data was disappearing into the ether on me!

Not that there isn't enough SCMS data already.

Krista,

I am temporarily archiving to the MSS, all the SCMS HRT files (except RF05
which is too big).  The job is presently underway.  That way, if Allen
needs a large amount of space, we can delete them from /home/productiondata
and still be able to retrieve them.  (They are being saved with both a read
and write password.)

I will also write to Darrel to see if he has any files I can delete or stash.

archived my SCMS high-rate files in /home/productiondata to

Krista,

I have finished archiving all the HRT files except 162rf05h.cdf, which
is larger than 400,000,000 bytes.  The files that have been archived are:
-rw-r--r--   1 nimbus   proj     257199892 Feb 27 09:43 162rf01h.cdf
-rw-r--r--   1 nimbus   proj     200043052 Feb 27 13:35 162rf02h.cdf
-rw-r--r--   1 nimbus   proj     375363772 Feb 27 11:40 162rf03h.cdf
-rw-r--r--   1 nimbus   proj     251362492 Feb 27 16:30 162rf04h.cdf
-rw-r--r--   1 nimbus   proj     246419332 Mar  1 11:18 162rf06h.cdf

So you may go play.

Krista,

Some Mass Store bitfile information for you (in case you want me to change
anything):

On Tuesday I added the same READ password to all the MSS bitfiles in the
following paths:
        /RAF/1995/162/LRT/PMS-1D
        /RAF/1995/162/ORIGINAL/LRT

Wben I archived the 5 HRT netCDF files last Monday, they were also protected
by the READ password and are in the path:
        /RAF/1995/162/ORIGINAL/HRT

There is no READ password on (and, hence, anyone can access) the production
LRT netCDF data in the path:
        /RAF/1995/162/LRT/*.cdf
These data were archived on 26 February 1996.

Bitfiles still exist in the protected preliminary directory:
        /RAF/1995/162/LRT/PRELIMINARY

You can refer to the local file:  /home/local/proj/archives/msfiles/msls.162
for a complete list of all bitfiles associated with SCMS.  Files protected
by a READ password have an "R" at the beginning of the status field.  The
"W" means a WRITE password exists.

Thanks for the bitfile info.  

FYI, I probably will be having you make some changes within
the next few days.  I'm going to have to re-run the high-rate
files you've already archived due to a need to do some filtering,
but I'll let you know when that needs to happen.

We can leave the "bad" HRT bitfiles on the MSS, since they are READ

Chris and Ron,

I've gone ahead and turned off output of the variables DRFTA,
HGM232S, TKAR, and TKAT in the setups for the SCMS production
runs.  However, I do have a request to make.

In future, Chris, if the need arises to make such variable output changes
as were necessary for ACE-1, I would ask that you please notify the
rest of us that are doing production runs at the time.  I realize
that you can't always hold off on your releases due to processing
needs for other projects, but it's pretty frustrating to find changes
showing up in the midst of your production runs and to have to
continually go back and make changes to existing setup files.

Krista,

I began archiving the SCMS HRT files in /productiondata.  You should be
aware, however, that I cannot archive RF05, because its size exceeds
400,000,000 bytes.  Once I archive the others, perhaps you can use Chris
Webster's new program (ncextr) to split it into two smaller files that
I can archive.

I'll let you know when the jobs have completed.

Krista,

The following files have been successfully archived to the SCD Mass Store
System (MSS) in the directory /RAF/1995/162/ORIGINAL/HRT/ with the same READ
password as all the other protected bitfiles.

  Source      Destination
------------  -----------
162rf01h.cdf  RF01.cdf
162rf02h.cdf  RF02.cdf
162rf03h.cdf  RF03.cdf
162rf04h.cdf  RF04.cdf
162rf06h.cdf  RF06.cdf
162rf07h.cdf  RF07.cdf

RF05 was too large for the MSS.

Ron,

Sitting in /home/productiondata are high-rate files for SCMS
RF01-RF07 (with the usual naming conventions).  CAn you
please archive these to the Mass Store in the directory that
is read/write password protected?  (I.e., not the final
directory.)

Thanks.

Krista

Krista,

These MSS bitfiles have the same password as the other preliminary data.
I will give it to you in person or over the phone.  To retrieve one of
these, use the following command:

  nrnet msget $MIGS/162rfxxh.cdf r flnm=/RAF/1995/162/ORIGINAL/HRT/RFxx.cdf \
   r=readpassword

where "xx" is the flight segment (put in two places on the command line).

You can find a list of all the MSS bitfiles in the local file:
  /home/local/proj/archives/msfiles/msls.162

Ron,

Sitting in /home/productiondata are four SCMS files that are
ready to be archived to the Mass Store.  They are:

162rf02hprb.cdf
162rf03hprb.cdf

--> to go to the PMS1d high-rate subdirectory with the read
    password

162rf02h.cdf
162rf03h.cdf

--> to go to the general HRT subdirectory for release to the
    public (i.e., these final version files)

Let me know as soon as possible that they are archived so that
I can get them off the disk and get myself some more room.

Thx.

Krista

Ron,

I've finished splitting the high-rate file for SCMS RF05 into
two pieces, so it's ready to go up to the Mass Store.  The
two file names are 162rf05ha.cdf and 162rf05hb.cdf, and they
are in /home/productiondata.  These are the original (i.e.,
not final version) files.  Can you please go ahead and archive
these two so that I can go ahead and merge in the two probe
subset files?  Thanks.

Okay, yet another set of files are ready to go up to the
Mass Store to be saved for posterity.  They are:

PMS-1D files:  162rf04hprb.cdf  
               162rf05haprb.cdf
               162rf05hbprb.cdf

Final high-rate file:  162rf04h.cdf

As I said, I'll let you know when the final versions of
the two 162rf05h files (a and b) are ready to go up.

Krista,

Is it OK if I wait until these merged files for RF05 are ready before
I archive the files mentioned in your previous email?  To wit:
     162rf06hprb.cdf
     162rf07hprb.cdf
     162rf06h.cdf
     162rf07h.cdf

If you need the disk space, I'll expedite the archiving.  Just let me know.

Let me know when all the files I've emailed you about have

SCMS Update (As of 4/8/96)
--------------------------

Low-rate data:  Processing and Mass Store archiving complete; ready
                for release

High-rate data:  Processing continuing.  Anticipate completion of
                 this and of archiving by 4/15/96 at the latest.

At present, it is anticipated that the data documentation notebooks
will be completed and released by 4/22/96 at the latest (I'm aiming
for 4/19/96).

Another batch of files is ready to go up to the MSS.  They
are:

162rf16h.cdf
162rf17h.cdf
162rf18h.cdf

and

162rf16hprb.cdf
162rf17hprb.cdf
162rf18hprb.cdf

All are in /home/productiondata.  Same drill....they need to go
in the directories with the read password.

Let me know when these have been archived and I'll create the final
files.

They are:

162rf13ha.cdf
162rf13hb.cdf
162rf19h.cdf
162rf20h.cdf

And, as the saying goes, that's all she wrote!

I do have two documents I need you to generate for me, Ron.
You know the Production Mass Store Bitfile Log you printed up
for me for the LRT files?  I need one for the HRT files and one
for the 2D files you archived for me.  I'm trying to get the
notebooks out within the next week, so if you could get this
to me within the next couple of days, I would appreciate it.

Thanks!

I already have a log for the PMS-2D processing.  It is the file:
   /home/local/proj/162/Production/taplog.pms2d.162

I can print it out for you if you want.  (The unknown times are caused
by the fact that I copied by record only and didn't decode the time on
any of them.  I hope that is not a critical omission.)

I'm working on the HRT log and should have it ready sometime tomorrow.
It is partially completed as the file (needs bitfile size update):
   /home/local/proj/162/Production/taplog.hrt.162

Krista,

Now that the final processed data sets have been archived to the SCD Mass
Store System (MSS), when do you think we should delete the MSS directory
   /RAF/1995/162/LRT/PRELIMINARY/

I imagine you want to let all the users of that directory know that it
will disappear.  There is no rush on my part, so just let me know.

Krista,

I removed the write permissions of certain files in the 162 project directory
as well as its Production subdirectory (Categories, Defaults, DependTable,
LowRateVars, ProjectName, VarDB, Flight*, proj.info, taplog* and
p2ms.summary).  (I didn't change permission for taplog.ads.162.)

I am writing this message to urge you to change the ownership of any pertinent
project files (those needed for doing any of the production processing) in
the 162 root or any of its subdirectories.  Since we mortals don't have that
direct ability (chown only works for "root."), I have used the "cp -ip <file>"
command and some others (under the "nimbus" login) to:
   1) create a temporary copy of a file so "nimbus" owns it (I call mine
       "temp."),
   2) delete the original file, 
   3) rename the temporary file to the original name,
   4) remove write permission on the file.
If a file's permissions are set correctly (-rw-rw-r--), one can do all this
from the "nimbus" login.  Here is a typical command sequence for one file:
   cp -ip savefile temp
   rm savefile
   mv temp savefile
   chmod a-w savefile

For a directory, use the following procedure:
   1) rename the original directory,
   2) create a new directory with the original name,
   3) move all the files from the renamed directory into the new (original)
       one,
   4) delete the renamed directory.
It is not necessary to change the directory's permissions.  Here is a typical
command sequence for doing one directory:
   mv orig.directory dummy
   mkdir orig.directory
   mv dummy/* orig.directory/.
   rm -ir dummy

If this seems too cumbersome for you, I can do this work so long as you
give me a list of file and directory names and set each file's permissions
to -rw-rw-r-- (chmod ug+rw <file>).  I believe most of the ones you own are
set that way now.

By doing this work we protect this directory from inadvertent change.  Anyone
using this project for analysis will, by default, get all the "production"
setup information, but s/he won't be able to do any custom modifications to
our production setup.  The "nimbus" ownership will make the files available
for future access by any authorized "project" person, since the files are not
owned by an individual.  This is important should we find a need to fix
something and reprocess the data.

I'd also like you to give me a list of all the "special" files that you want
me to put in the MSS archive for users to access.  I will save those as
separate bitfiles in addition to putting them into the tar files that I
archive.

I will soon work on the script that will archive all the project's support
files.  Please let me know when you have everything ready.

Thanks for all your work.  You have done a great job with both the
processing and its documentation.  Obviously, the users will reap the
greatest benefits.

I think I'm going to ask you to handle this for me.  Once
I've wrapped up the documentation and sent out the notebooks,
I'll get together a list of the files and directories that
need this treatment.

Ron,

Okay, I think I've got all of the files ready to go for the
changes you need to make and/or the versions that are ready
to go up to the Mass Store.  So, here's how things look on
a directory-by-directory basis:


1) /home/local/proj/162:  All of the files in here with my
   name listed as the owner have the necessary group write
   permission for you to go ahead and make the necessary
   protection changes.  I have one more README file to
   generate (the one outlining necessary processing steps),
   but that will be the last one.

2) /home/local/proj/162/Production:  I believe all of the
   files here are in the right "protection" state (i.e., owned
   by nimbus, read permission only), but you may want to check
   me on that.

3) hl proj/162/afterJuly25, /beforeJuly25, /hrAfterJuly25, and
   /hrBeforeJuly25:  I have changed all of the files in each of
   these four subdirectories over to the right status (owned
   by nimbus, read only).  They're ready to be archived.

4) hl proj/162/scmsdocs:  All of the files in this directory
   are owned by me,  but have group read-write permission so
   that you can change them over to the right protection status.

5) hl proj/162/scmsdocs/mrcompfiles:  All of the files in this
   directory are owned by me, but as above, they have the right
   read-write permissions so that you can go in and change them
   over to nimbus and apply read only.


Okay, I think that's all of it.  Let me know if you have any 
questions or need my help any further on this.  I'll let you
know when the final README file is in place.

All,

Just a quick note to let everyone know that processing of
the SCMS (Proj. No. 5-162) data (both low- and high-rate)
has been completed.  Pending the final archival of the
relevant processing files, the official release of the data
set will be announced to the project PIs this week.  The
RAF copy of the data documentation notebook is available
in the project office for perusal, and the two remaining
notebooks for Charlie Knight and Al Cooper will be delivered
on Tuesday, 16 April.

Should any of you have any questions, please do not hesitate
to contact me.

Krista,

Generally, I understand your plan for archiving all the SCMS files to the Mass
Store.  I would like to clarify just what files you want to make available as
separate bitfiles for the users, as opposed to a large tar file (or files).
In general the MSS folks like bitfiles to be as large as practical, but I put
out some very small bitfiles for most projects (like the "taplog" and netCDF
header dumps, among others).

If you would please let me know which files (or groups of files) you want to
exist separately, I can archive them accordingly.  Perhaps you already have
that info in a document you are preparing/have prepared for the users.

I archive a lot of the support files as a single tar file, especially the
the ones in a project's Production subdirectory (Flight_XX, etc.), since
these would be brought back as a block and wouldn't really be needed by
anyone but RAF.  Your project has a bunch of extra stuff that I want to
be sure to handle correctly.

Thanks.

Ron,

I may not have done a very good job of explaining how I wanted things to
go up to the MSS.  So, let's see if this makes more sense:

1)  I do indeed want the files for the users to go up to the
MSS and be stored as single bitfiles.  As we discussed, here's
how it should go:

    a)  Each of the files in the directory /home/local/proj/162/
        scmsdocs should go up to the MSS and each be stored as
        a separate bitfile.  As we discussed, the MSS path for
        the directory containing all of these files should be
        /RAF/1995/162/DOCS.

    b)  Within the scmsdocs subdirectory referred to in (a) above,
        there is another subdirectory called "mrcompfiles."  There
        are 20 files in this latter subdirectory, and each of them
        should be archived as a separate bitfile.  As we discussed,
        the MSS path for the directory containing these files should
        be /RAF/1995/162/DOCS/MRCOMPFILES.

2)  I have generated three README files for SCMS.  One of them,
README.processing, is really only relevant to RAF staff.  I guess
my feeling on this one is that it can be archived in a "block" along
with the other support (i.e., Production directory) files.

3)  There are two other README files (README.FIRST and README.DOCS)
that the users must have access to.  I would like to have each of
these two files archived separately as independent bitfiles.  As to
where they should be placed....possibly in the MSS path
/RAF/1995/162?  Let me know what your thoughts are on this, but they
need to be someplace where the users accessing the data will readily
find them.

As I allude to in (2) above, I have no problem with all of the
support files being archived in one big "lump."  That seems to make
the most sense, given that those files really won't be of any
interest to the users (and I really don't want "outsiders" poking
around them, anyway).

I have made copies of each of the three README files I discuss
above for you and have placed them in your box out here at RAF.
However, should you need to see them while you're working at FL
today, they reside in the /home/local/proj/162 directory.

Hope this has cleared up the confusion.

At any rate, I was just looking over hl proj/162 and noticed
that a couple of pre-SCMS (i.e., preliminary release) files
still exist:  README.prescms and prescms.files.  As far as
I'm concerned, this can both be removed before you archive
everything.  Agreed?

I forgot to tell you in my last email message that I've
already generated two ASCII files containing low- and high-
rate netCDF header dumps (needed them for the documentation
notebooks).  They are the two files "162lrtdump.asc" (low-rate)
and "162hrtdump.asc" (high-rate) in the directory
/home/local/proj/162/scmsdocs.

Okay, one of these mornings I'll get organized and won't
have to send you so many fragmented email messages....

At any rate, I was just looking over hl proj/162 and noticed
that a couple of pre-SCMS (i.e., preliminary release) files
still exist:  README.prescms and prescms.files.  As far as
I'm concerned, this can both be removed before you archive
everything.  Agreed?

Krista,

I suppose it would be well to divorce ourselves entirely from the preliminary
data (that means to me not giving any help/support, etc.  to users of that
data since the "good stuff" will be available).  To that end, I say let's
purge everything associated with "preliminary."

Krista,

Is there a reason to save or archive the following local files?

/home/local/proj/162
     Defaults.bkup
     DependTable.bkup
     scms.nimbus

/home/local/proj/162/Production
     scms.nimbus

Note:  The two files named "scms.nimbus" are identical.

I'm just about ready to shoot everything up to the MSS.  Any last-minute
changes you want to make (besides the above)?

Ron,

I'd forgotten I'd created the files Defaults.bkup and
DependTable.bkup (done after Chris accidentally overwrote
the SCMS Defaults and DependTable files a few months
ago).  Go ahead and remove them.

As for the scms.nimbus files, I do want to keep one of them
as a backup (this file contains all of the right cal cos,
etc.).  But we certainly don't need two!  So, why don't you
leave the one that's in the /Production subdirectory and
remove the one that's in /162.

I can't think of anything else that I want to add before you
fire this stuff off.  (Of course, I'm probably brain-dead
after spending so much time on this.)  So, fire away.

Thanks for catching the above oversights for me.

Krista

Hi Ron,

I've been out of the memo loop lately, and I was wondering if I should
continue working with the preliminary C130 data on the Mass Store, or if
the final versions are available yet?

Thanks!

Sonia,

Strange you should ask!  It just so happens that I'm archiving all the
support files to the Mass Store today.  Please STOP working with the
Preliminary data; it will soon be disappearing from the Mass Store
anyway.  The final data are present there now.  Below are the bitfile
logs for both the low-rate (LRT) and high-rate (HRT) data.  If you
also need access to the PMS-2D data or the raw aircraft data, please
let Krista Laursen <krista@ucar.edu> or me know.

Krista is sending a memo (or perhaps email) to the PIs describing all
the information we are archiving to the Mass Store.  Of particular
interest to you will be the bitfiles "/RAF/1995/162/README.FIRST" and
"/RAF/1995/162/README.DOC."

(MSS).  A complete list of all the MSS bitfiles for this project can be 
found in the file:  /home/local/proj/archives/msfiles/msls.162.

I will soon update the master RAF MSS directory file here, but since it
already has listings for the raw and netCDF data, I see no rush to do that
just yet.  (I'll probably wait until the preliminary data are removed.)

So, it looks like SCMS is almost finished!  I'll create the script to delete
all the PRELIMINARY bitfiles, so it's ready to run when the time comes.
Please give me a date after which I should remove them.

It's been great working with you on this!

All right!!  The end is so close, you can almost taste it!

I'll go ahead and send out a broadcast email message to the
SCMS PIs tomorrow announcing the release of the data set.
I've already drafted this message, and in it I'm going to give
them two weeks to either destroy or surrender their preliminary
files.  The actual "drop dead" date will be 2 May 1996.  In
this message, I've stated that the preliminary files and
documentation are already gone, so my feeling is that you can
go ahead and get rid of them now.  There's really no point in
them being there any more, since the users will now have all
of the final data to work with.

It's been great working with you on this, as well.  Now we
can both do the dance of joy on another job completed.

Krista

Krista,

OK,  I'll send the job to get rid of all the preliminary data on the MSS.
I'll let you know when they're gone (probably before tomorrow morning).

All,
 
Final processing of the SCMS C-130 data set has been completed,
and I am pleased to announce the official release of the data.
Both low- and high-rate data have been generated and are now
available to SCMS PIs for perusal and analysis.
 
The purpose of this email message is to provide you all with
some information regarding the data set, to outline RAF policy
regarding data set access and availability, and to delinieate
handling of data files created during the preliminary release
of the data set last fall.
 
 
-------------------------
General Data Set Comments
-------------------------
 
 
Following are some general comments on the data products that
are available and the associated documentation:
 
1)  Both low- and high-rate files have been generated for the
SCMS C-130 research flights.  In the case of the low-rate data,
files have been generated for all flights; i.e., both ferry
flights (to and from Florida) and the twenty (20) research
flights.  In the case of the high-rate data, files have been
generated only for the 20 research flights.  As is standard
RAF procedure, all data were processed and output into
netCDF format files.
 
    Separate files containing 2D-probe (2D-C, 2D-P, and HVPS)
data were generated for each ferry and research flight.  Users
should be aware, however, that these files contain straight
2D record dumps from the raw aircraft data tape for each flight.
No processing of the data was done.  Specific questions on the
record format of these files and on how to access the 2D data
files should be addressed to Ron Ruth here at RAF (see below
for a phone number and email address).
 
2)  A significant number of documents were generated during
the course of the final processing which describe the contents
and quality of the final C-130 data set.  While these documents
were created for the data documentation notebooks (archived
with Charlie Knight, Al Cooper, and in the RAF Projects Office),
the majority of them have also been archived on the NCAR
Mass Storage System (MSS) in order to be available to project
PIs.  IN ORDER TO ACCESS THESE AVAILABLE FILES, AND TO GAIN
ACCESS TO OTHER IMPORTANT DATA SET INFORMATION, YOU ARE ADVISED
TO TAKE NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING:
 
    -->  In the MSS directory path /RAF/1995/162, there are
         two ASCII-format README files, entitled README.FIRST
         and README.DOCS.  README.FIRST contains important
         information on how to gain further information on
         available project documentation, as well as a statement
         of the RAF policy regarding data set availability
         and access.  README.DOCS contains a complete listing
         of the names and file formats of the documents 
         archived on the MSS which provide information on the
         data set quality and availability.  BEFORE ACCESSING
         OR ANALYZING ANY OF THE SCMS C-130 DATA, YOU ARE
         ADVISED TO FIRST DOWNLOAD COPIES OF EACH OF THESE
         README FILES AND TO PERUSE THE CONTENTS CAREFULLY.
         Examination of these two files will aid you in your
         studies of the data.
 
3)  Every attempt has been made to be as thorough and complete
as possible during the quality checking of the SCMS data set.
However, given the large volume of instruments flown on the
aircraft and the resultant large number of processed variables,
it is possible that some problems within the data set were not
detected.  Users of these data are encouraged to notify the RAF
should they discover additional problems and/or limitations
within the data set.  Information regarding such problems
should be brought to the attention of either Krista Laursen,
the SCMS C-130 Project Manager (303-497-1031, or krista@ncar.ucar.edu)
or Ron Ruth, the RAF Data Manager (303-497-1084, or
ruth@ncar.ucar.edu).
 
Finally, please note the following:
 
***************************************************************
All requests for SCMS data and/or questions about how to access
data files on the MSS should be directed to Ron Ruth, the RAF
Data Manager, directly.  Ron can be reached at 303-497-1084
or via email at ruth@ncar.ucar.edu.
***************************************************************
 
 
----------------------------------------------------
RAF Policy Regarding Data Set Usage and Distribution
----------------------------------------------------
 
 
RAF policy regarding access to, usage of, and distribution of
aircraft data is as follows:
 
For one (1) year following the date of release of the processed data
(18 April 1996), only project PIs are allowed to have free access to,
and are allowed to publish with, the data.  Users not associated with
the project as PIs can have access to the data ONLY after
obtaining the permission of the main project PI (in the case of
SCMS, Dr. Charlie Knight).  DURING THIS FIRST YEAR OF RELEASE,
THE RAF WILL NOT PROVIDE NON-PROJECT PIS WITH DATA UNTIL WE HAVE
RECEIVED WRITTEN OR VERBAL PERMISSION FROM CHARLIE KNIGHT
TO DO SO.
 
After this one-year period, the SCMS data set will be made
available to the general scientific public for use and publication.
 
The RAF asks that all SCMS PIs and prospective users of the data set
comply with this policy.
 
 
-----------------------------------------------------
Policy Regarding Preliminary Release C-130 Data Files
-----------------------------------------------------
 
 
Several of you obtained copies of data files and tapes made
available last fall during a preliminary release of SCMS data.
Per the statements outlined in my memo of 3 November 1995
describing the preliminary data set, the following policy
regarding preliminary data tapes and files is now in force:
 
    -->  WITHIN TWO (2) WEEKS OF THE DATE OF THIS FINAL
         DATA SET RELEASE--BY 2 MAY 1996--USERS POSSESSING
         PRELIMINARY DATA FILES ARE ASKED TO EITHER
         A) DESTROY THEIR COPIES OF THESE PRELIMINARY
         FILES AND NOTIFY RON RUTH HERE AT RAF
         (ruth@ncar.ucar.edu) THAT THE FILES HAVE BEEN 
         DESTROYED, OR B) SURRENDER THEIR PRELIMINARY FILE
         COPIES TO RON RUTH.  (Same mailing address as in
         my tag at the end of this message.)
 
The reason we are insisting on this latter policy is so as
to avoid any confusion regarding the preliminary and final
data sets.  We want to avoid the risk of preliminary files being
circulated and mistaken for final, quality-checked data files.
 
You should all be aware that, following the archival of the
final SCMS data files to the Mass Store, all preliminary set
data files were removed.  Also, all documentation pertaining to
the preliminary data set has been destroyed.

 
I believe that is all for now.  I wanted to let you all know
how much I have appreciated your patience during the somewhat
long timeframe between the field deployment and this final
release of the data set.  However, I think the delay has been
worth it.  I believe the SCMS C-130 data set contains low-
and high-rate data of high quality and is a data set that is
unique in breadth, given the large volume and scope of   
microphysical instruments flown on the aircraft during the
project.
 
I have greatly enjoyed working with all of you during the 
course of SCMS and wish you all the best of luck during your
studies of this data set and in your future research endeavors.
Should there ever be anything I or my colleagues can do to assist
you in your work, please do not hesitate to contact me here at
the RAF.
 
Best regards,
 
Krista Laursen
SCMS C-130 Project Manager

Sonia,

The PMS-2D and HVPS data are both in the same group of bitfiles on the
SCD Mass Store System (MSS).  Following is a log showing the path name
and a list of the individual files.  All are available via IRJE or MIGS
using "transparent" mode to produce a UNIX file of the data.

Each PMS-2D record in a file is 28812 bytes long and comprises seven
(7) logical records.  You may want to contact Darrel Baumgardner
<darrel@raf.atd.ucar.edu, (303)497-1054> or Chris Webster
<chris@raf.atd.ucar.edu, (303)597-1044> regarding the format of the
data within individual records of each file.  Darrel is our authority
for data processing and interpretation.

I'm sure you got Krista Laursen's email announcing the completion of
our processing.  That message has more information that you can use.
Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any other questions or problems.

Hi Ron,

As per Krista's e-mail from 18 April, I'm officially notifying you that
I have destroyed all my copies of preliminary SCMS data files from the C-130,
and am now using the final qc'd data files.

Have a good day.

Sonia

I am interested in accessing data collected by the C130
from SCMS.  I have never retrieved data from the NCAR
mass store, so I really have no idea what to do or how
to get started.  I would appreciate it if you could e-mail
me some documentation or e-mail me the location where
documentation is kept and that I may get it using an
anonymous ftp.  Thanks in advance.

Dave,

Bob Rilling gave me a copy of a letter that Charlie Knight wrote to you asking
for proprietary rights to the 1995-162 SCMS data.  I need to know whether
you officially approved Charlie's request.  I just received an email inquiry
about that data from Jeffrey R. French (U. Wyoming), someone not on Charlie's
initial "approved" list, and I am reluctant to give him the information until
I know whether the SCMS data are public or private.

Thanks.  I'll also pass your reply to Bob Rilling who also will need this
information.

Krista,

I received the following request via this morning's email and am unclear,
at this point, what to do about the implied data request.  (I can steer him
to on-line information regarding MSS access.)  Having not heard whether Dave
Carlson has approved Charlie's request for proprietary access, I sent Dave
an email directly asking him that question.  Jeff's name was not on the
earlier "approved" list that Charlie gave you, so I am reluctant to send him
anything until I get Dave's reply.  Once I get word on Charlie's request, I
either proceed or ask Jeff to contact Charlie for permission to access the
data.

I just thought you should be informed.

Charlie,

I just received this request for information regarding SCMS data and thought
you should be informed about it.  Though not specifically stated, I assume
this is a request for the data.  I have not yet gotten word about whether
Dave Carlson has approved your request to proprietary rights to the data,
but I have not yet replied to Jeff while I await more information.

(Sorry my previous email didn't include this header.)

Afternoon, Ron--
I guess you sent Jeff's data request on to me for OK, and if that is it,
yes--Wyoming was a PI (If an institution can be one), and he's doing his 
thesis on SCMS data, so he certainly qualifies for everything.

Dear Ron,

     I would appreciate receiving tapes of all of the hi and lo-rate C130 data
from SCMS. Brad Baker and I will share the data. Also, we will erase any C130
data that we have on disk when we receive the tapes. 

     Please let me know what this will cost. We will gladly reimburse
NCAR for the expense. 

     Thank you.

OK--now I see your letter to me.  I just talked with Dave Carlson, and the 
data policy is that "we" have exclusive rights to the data untill something 
like a year from now, and Jeff French is definitely one of the exclusive 
group.  (I'll be most surprised if there ever is a data request that gets 
turned down, but it isn't quite impossible.)

Charlie,

Thanks for your reply.  I'll get Jeff started ASAP.

I thought you'd like to know that Alan Blyth also has requested all
the data.

And finally, thanks for your update on "exclusive rights" permission.
I had not heard anything definite about it before now.

Following is an email message I received from Charlie today.  So now

Ron,

I need you to do something for me.  Because of the change
to the data release statement (i.e., the granting of
data exclusivity for the SCMS data set), I have modified
the README.FIRST file in /home/local/proj/162.  I have
given the file the correct read only permissions, and I
need you to now send it up to the Mass Store to be archived
in place of the old README.FIRST file.

This should be done as soon as possible.  Thanks.

Krista

Subject: Amendment to SCMS data policy statement

All,

The purpose of this message is to inform you all of a correction
to a statement I made in my email message announcing the release
of the SCMS C-130 data set.

In my earlier message, I stated that the official RAF policy
regarding usage and distribution of aircraft data sets was that
for one (1) year following the date of release of the processed
data, only project PIs are allowed to have free access to, and
are allowed to publish with, the data.  I was subsequently 
informed that this is NOT, in fact, the ATD (Atmospheric Technology
Division) policy regarding data set access.  The official policy
is, actually, as follows:  1)  all data sets collected with
ATD facilities and archived by ATD will be made available to
the scientific community upon request and at out-of-pocket
expense;  2)  in the first year after the data have been collected,
the PIs will be notified by the appropriate ATD facility whenever
a distribution of data outside of the project PIs network is
requested; 3)  the PIs within a particular research program
will be granted proprietary rights to data collected by ATD's
facilities for a period of one year, if a written request is
received within two-months after the observational phase of
the program has been completed (this request must be submitted
to Dave Carlson, Director of the Atmospheric Technology
Division, and must represent a consensus of all of the project
PIs); and 4)  data collected by individual scientists with their
own instruments and archived on their individual data systems
are the property of the individual, and community access to
these data sets will be at the discretion of the individual.

Regarding number (3) of the ATD data policy outlined above, Charlie
Knight, after getting a consensus from several of the SCMS
PIs, has requested and been granted data exclusivity for
the SCMS PIs for the C-130 data for a period of one (1) year.
The "clock" on this one-year period can be considered to
have started on the date of release of the data set, 18
April 1996.  The period will, therefore, end on 18 April 1997.
In line with the ATD policy, any requests for C-130 data from
investigators not officially associated with SCMS as a PI will
be forwarded to Charlie for his approval.  Once we have received
Charlie's approval, the RAF will proceed with filling the
data request.

In accordance with the data policy change, I have modified the
ASCII file README.FIRST archived on the Mass Store system to
include a statement about this period of one-year exclusivity.
I encourage all of you to obtain a copy of this file
before undertaking any analyses of the SCMS C-130 data.

I apologize to all of you for any confusion my earlier statement
regarding the RAF data policy may have caused.  Should you have
any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me
here at RAF.

Best regards,

Krista

All,

I just received a memo from Dave Carlson, and the dates
for the one year of proprietary access to the SCMS C-130
data have been changed slightly.  They are as follows:

1 May 1996 through 30 April 1997.

After this period, the data will go into open access.

Neil,

RE:   Aircraft data from the UW King Air and the French Merlin aircraft

I'm sorry to report that I do not have that information; I worked only
with the RAF data for SCMS.  I am forwarding your request to Charlie Knight
<knightc@ucar.edu>, the Principal Investigator for SCMS, who should have that
information.

Best regards.

Charlie,

You need not reply to this informational message.  I just wanted to let you
know that Jim Hudson (Desert Research Institute) requested a copy of all the
low-rate (1 sps) data from SCMS on 8mm (ExaByte) tape.  We'll be shipping
that out to him the week of 17 June 1996.

Subject: Correction to SCMS 260X dBZ Data

All,

Sonia Lasher-Trapp brought to my attention Friday afternoon
that a different correction needs to be applied to the SCMS
260X dBZ data (the variable DBZ6_OBR) in order to make them 
correct.

All users of the SCMS data are advised that ALL DBZ6_OBR values
need to be corrected as follows:

(DBZ6_OBR -3.0) * 10.0

(I.e., subtract 3.0 from the values output in the netCDF data
files and multiply the result by 10.0.)  This will yield correct
260X decibel values.

And just as a reminder, remember that the FSSP-100 dBZ values
need to be multiplied by 10.0 in order to make them correct.

Again, I apologize for any confusion all of this may have caused,
and I appreciate your patience.  Also, my thanks to Sonia for
catching this error for us.

Krista

Charlie,
I'm sorry I was unable to attend the SCMS meeting and sorrier that I could
not have discussed Herman's problem with you and him directly. As much as
I hate to get the management at ATD and RAF involved with issues like this,
I fear that we will be forced to given the past history between Herman
and NCAR and his penchant for paranoia at times.

I understand why you are requesting my input and I'm giving it below. Your
queries should normally go to the project manager, i.e. Krista, who
would then direct them to the appropriate people. I am. however, pretty
deeply involved, so I think that it is not inappropriate for me to respond
and perhaps Dick Friesen and Krista (copied on this message) can use
part of my response in replying to Herman. I'd suggest that you just tell
Herman that you have forwarded his concerns to RAF management but are
sending a letter to PIs that encourages their contacting him wrt PVM
issues.

What needs to be made very clear to Hermann is that the RAF has three types
of instruments that it flies: RAF internally supported instruments, leased
instruments, and user instruments. The first category of instruments provides
measurements that are completely quality assured and are freely available
to the scientific community with the usual provisos about PIs getting first
crack at using them. The second type of instrument is not usually quality
assured, it is leased by request from a PI or because it is an instrument
that the RAF only has one of during a period when two aircraft are being
operated and the same instrument is needed for each project. In the first case
the QA is left to the users, in the second case QA is done by the RAF. If
RAF leases the instrument then the data usage follows *exactly* the same rules
as any other RAF data set. If a user leases the instrument to put on the
aircraft, then the data belongs to the user (Dick or Krista should correct me
on this if I'm wrong). The user category of instrumentation is just like
user leased instruments, i.e., their instrument, their data. Sharing the data is
up to the user and other PIs. I don't know of any case where the RAF has
tried to extract data from a user whose instrument we have flown. The PVM
was an instrument that we leased for $12,000 and paid a specialist (Hermann)
to help maintain it. Hermann was under no obligation to QA his data, though
I am pleased that he did so. RAF is under no obligation to demand that users
notify Herman before using his data, or to even acknowledge him other than
referencing his papers on the instrument if a publication uses data from the
PVM. The fact that the instrument he loaned us was his personal unit does
not have any relevance. This was a business deal, not a scientific
collaboration. He has already QA'd the PVM data and his report is in the final
documentation. Although I think PIs and users should be encouraged to contact
Hermann with any questions about the data, I don't agree with his argument
that such contact should be mandatory.

As a side note, I believe that you placed an order for a PVM 9 months ago.
We have yet to receive it. Hermann told me 9 months ago that he was waiting
to get several other orders to make the manufacture of these probe financially
viable. Through my contacts, I have learned that he has received those other
orders and already delivered to two customers who ordered after we did. I
talked to Kathy M. at MMM and asked her to call purchasing and light a fire
under Hermann and ask him why the lengthy delay.

Charlie, its not your responsibility to deal with Herman and his concerns. It
is time to tell him to contact either Paul Herzegh or Dave Carlson directly
as this is an RAF/NCAR issue, not a PI issue. If you feel a responsibility
to make some type of response, I would only send a note to the PIs that
encourages them to contact Hermann directly with any questions about
interpretting PVM data and collaborating with him if they'd like to have
his participation in a specific research topic. I have some concerns about
Hermann's motivations and would like to make sure he understands the RAF
policy on data disemination. Quite frankly, I would like to get our instrument
in hand before he decides once again that he's going to punish us for allowing
SPEC to fly on the same aircraft and attend the same meetings and show data
that questions the quality of his instrument. (SPEC was not paid a dime to put
the CDS or HVPS on the C-130). I personally think the PVM is
a very good instrument with many of the same caveats that we place on other
LWC instruments. I look forward to looking further at the data, testing the
instrument, and assessing its limitations.

Subject: SCMS C-130 Data Time Stamp Error
Cc: dick, chris, ron, krista
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII

Content-Length: 1219
Status: RO

All,

Within the last two days here at the RAF, one of our software
engineers discovered an error in the time stamps on the netCDF
data files generated for the SCMS C-130 flights.  There is a
1-second discrepancy between the GPS time (the correct time) and
and the time stamped on each data record.  The time stamps
on the netCDF files that have been released for SCMS
are all 1 second later than they should be.

Therefore, all SCMS investigators are hereby notified that they
need to subtract 1 second from the times output in all of the
released netCDF data files.  For example, 15:20:02 should really
be 15:20:01, etc.

Please contact me here at the RAF should you have any questions
about this correction.

The RAF apologizes for any inconvenience this error may have
caused.

Sincerely,

Krista Laursen

Subject: 25-Hz Gerber Data

All,

Recently, some SCMS investigators had been looking at high-rate
(i.e., 25 Hz=sps) data collected from the Gerber probe on the C-130
and had raised some questions about the quality of the data.
Darrel, Chris Webster (a software engineer here at the RAF) and
I have been checking into this data quality issue and now have some
new information to report.

First, all SCMS PIs are hereby notified that the 25 Hz Gerber probe
data released in the high-rate C-130 files are corrupt and should
be ignored.  To explain why this is the case, let me explain briefly
a couple facets of how data collected on the C-130 are processed.
NIMBUS (the RAF data-processing software written by Chris Webster)
uses multi-rate decimating/interpolating FIR filters during the
processing of data.  For the old ADS (Aircraft Data System) flown
on the aircraft, it was possible to arrive at 25 Hz data from data
sampled at 25, 50, or 250 Hz by using factors of 5 and 2 in either
1 or 2 stages of filtering.  For the new data system flown on the
C-130, and in the present NIMBUS software configuration, only two
stages of filtering are possible.  During SCMS, the Gerber probe
data were sampled at 1000 Hz (the first utilization of this higher
rate), and in the present software configuration, it is not possible
to filter the data from 1000 to 25 Hz.  (This would require three
stages of filtering, rather than two, and would require a fairly
major revision to the processing code.)  When I processed the SCMS
data in high-rate format, the Gerber data, by default, was output
at 25 Hz; however, for the reasons given above, these data are
corrupt and invalid.  Users should note, however, that the low-rate
(i.e., 1 Hz) Gerber probe data are fine and are completely usable.

For users interested in obtaining high-rate (i.e., 25 Hz) Gerber
probe data, the following approach is suggested.  Users should
contact Ron Ruth (the RAF Data Manager; ruth@ucar.edu) to see about
obtaining 1000 Hz data for the time periods of interest.  These data
can then be averaged down to 25 Hz.  Note that users will be required
to perform this latter step (i.e., the averaging) themselves.

I apologize for any confusion this particular data issue may have
caused, and I thank the SCMS PIs working with the data for bringing
this problem to our attention.  Should any of you have any further
questions, please do not hesitate to contact me here at the RAF.

Best regards,

Krista

Ron,
I have been in recent communication with Graciela Raga at UNAM. She has
suffered a major disaster. The computer where she had all her data stored
and software installed crashed in a big way and she appears to have
lost all information on her disk. She can recover the data as she has
that on a DAT, but she no longer has the fortran source code that you
sent her for reading these files. Can you email her this source code?
Her email is raga@nefelos.atmosfcu.unam.mx.

She is also now going to begin working on SCMS data with me. Would you be
so kind as to put all the high rate netCdf files on a DAT tape(s) and
send them to 
Graciela Raga
Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera
UNAM
Ciudad Universitaria
04510 Mexico DF, Mexico


Thanks a lot Ron.

Darrel

Charlie,

I got a request for the complete SCMS aircraft data set (high-rate data,
low-rate data and support files)  from Graciela Raga, Ciudad Universitaria,
Mexico City, via Darrel Baumgardner who will be working with her.

This email is a formal request for permission to send her these data, since
neither of them is on your official list.

Darrel,

Graciela picked up our FORTRAN GENPRO read routines via anonymous ftp.  I'll
give here the same information, again since I'm not sure which version she
grabbed.  (I have a couple special versions for DEC machines.)

The SCMS data set is protected by proprietary data rights until 2 May 1997,
so I'll have to forward her data request to Charlie Knight for approval.
I don't suspect he will have a problem giving it.

After that I'll forward the SCMS request to RDP.  I plan to send Graciela the
complete SCMS package on DAT tapes which includes the low-rate data (netCDF),
high-rate data (netCDF) and the support files (ASCII and PostScript) which
Krista prepared for the project.  We normally put them in a series of tar
files.  Please let me know if you think she will have trouble reading tar
files.

Krista,

I am reasonably sure that I have recovered all the READ passwords for the
protected MSS bitfiles for SCMS.  All the documentation is in the directory:
     /home/local/proj/162/Production/archive/restricted/
which is accessible only by the "nimbus" login (and superuser).
I had thought I used only one password, but somehow two crept in.

I've verified there are many missing values in both files for CFSSP_IBR.
I think CONCF_IBR looks reasonable because there seem to always be some
good values, and that fill value is 9e-38.  I've verified also that FACT_IBR
exceeds .099999, therefore causing a problem when we multiply by 10....
It be worhtwhile to bring down low-rate, and compare the CONCF_IBR with
ncplot.

I still don't feel well, so I'm going home.

    A conclusion is simply the place where you got tired of thinking.

Krista,

Jay Miller has been analyzing the HRT data from SCMS and discovered many
"fill" values from the high-rate PMS data.  Chris thinks there is a bug
in NIMBUS which caused the problem and is investigating it.  I brought
down two flights for examination:
     directory:  /home/data/migs/ron/
     -rw-rw-rw-   1 migs     migs     375665976 Dec 17 12:13 162rf03h.cdf
     -rw-rw-rw-   1 migs     migs     290744220 Dec 17 11:58 162rf12h.cdf

Apparently we have no tools right now that can examine these data except
for the very crude output available via `ncdump.'

Before he went home, sick, Chris briefly looked at these and made the
following comments:
     "I've verified there are many missing values in both files for
     CFSSP_IBR.  I think CONCF_IBR looks reasonable because there seem
     to always be some good values, and that fill value is 9e-38.  I've

     problem when we multiply by 10....  It be worthwhile to bring down
     low-rate, and compare the CONCF_IBR with ncplot."

I am in the process of bringing down the LRT versions of these files.
They will be in the same directory.

I assume you want to follow this investigation, too.

Thanks for keeping me in the loop, Ron.  I'll attempt to
follow this as best I can, but I'm tied up with multiple
other projects at present and can't dedicate a lot of time
to this right now.  I appreciate any help you'll be able
to give to Chris and Jay.

I've cc'd Darrel on this, also, so he knows what's going
on.

Chris,

I assume that you also fixed the version for SCMS reprocessing:
   /home/local/nimbus_scms/src/filter/nimbus
since its executable was rewritten only a minute before the
development version.

Confirm please.  I'd like to test a production run (then maybe
complete the processing from RF06 on if all look OK).

I did change SCMS, then realized it didn't matter, since we weren't zeroing
out buffers back then.

Chris,

Thanks for letting me know, since I'm just starting the processing.  I assume
we ignore flights before RF06.  I have enough to keep me busy anyway.  I hope
there's enough disk space to retrieve a bunch of these raw ADS files.

Jay,

   Today I reprocessed SCMS RF06-RF20 using Chris' newest version of the
NIMBUS processor.  As he may have mentioned to you, only the LRT data are
available at this time.  I hope to do the HRT processing as soon as Chris gets
NIMBUS whipped into shape.  The alternative (if you are pressed for time) is
to eliminate the Gerber data.
   The data have not yet been archived to the SCD Mass Store System.  I hope
to archive them sometime tomorrow.  (They will replace the LRT data sets that
are already there.  The old bitfiles will be renamed.)  You may pick up all
these data via anonymous ftp:

Chris,

I reprocessed SCMS LRT RF06-RF20 today and copied all the files to our
anonymous ftp space (~ftp/pub/tmp/scms/162rf??.cdf) so Jay Miller could
pick them up.  I looked at a few of the files, and the data seem OK to me.

The raw ADS data for all these flights is at Jeffco; most of the files are in
/home/staticdata with the remainder (except for RF12) in my MIGS directory.

I haven't yet archived these new files to the MSS.  Before I do, I need to
rename all the ones out there and keep them around at least temporarily.
There isn't a lot of room left in the productiondata directory to do a lot
of SCMS HRT processing.  I should be able to free up most of that space
tomorrow as I archive things.

Ron,

Thanks for your message on reprocessing of SCMS data.  I assume you intend to
reprocess SCMS RF01-05.  It happens those are among the flights that I have
the greatest interest in right now.  I think we can wait on the high-rate until
Chris does his thing with NIMBUS.  Personally, I don't want to use the Gerber
probe, but others might and I wouldn't want to see you have to reprocess yet
again just to pick up that probe.

This took awhile, but Chris did a great job of finding and fixing the problems
with the original processing.  And thank you for doing the reprocessing.

Jay

Chris & Darrel,

Yesterday I reprocessed SCMS LRT RF06-RF20 using the latest specially-modified
version of the NIMBUS processor (/home/local/nimbus_scms/src/filter/nimbus).

Jay Miller is greatly interested in getting LRT RF01-RF05 reprocessed as well
as all the HRT data.  I know Chris is working on getting the 1000sps Gerber
probe data into the HRT version of NIMBUS, but what do we need to do to
properly handle the first five flights?

Jay mentioned a 2 June Cloud Physics Conference deadline, but I'm not sure we
can get them all the HRT data in time for them to analyze them and have their
papers ready.

Jay,

As I understand things, the first five flights need unique PMS-1D processing;
the present code won't work for them.  I will send email to Chris and Darrel
to see when the NIMBUS processor will be ready so we can finish them off.

I'll also do the HRT data when the processor is ready for the 1000sps
Gerber data.  I, of course, could do the HRT without it, but I don't relish
the thought of reprocessing that data twice.  The HRT processing takes much
more time and effort.

If all you investigators can live without the high-rate Gerber data, I'm
ready to process the HRT now.  Since Charlie Knight is the PI, I would
need some official word from him, I guess.

At any rate, I'll do what I can to get all this done for you.

Ron,
The only difference is how we handle the activity. In flights 1-5 I used a 
different activity calculation that was easily handled just by making
the long reset delay time a bit longer to account for the fact that
we had no total resets. I think Chris has that built in already, but
I'll check with him when he gets here.

Darrel and Chris,

   I have not yet been able to find this code in NIMBUS.  Do you know in
which file it appears?

   When the original production processing was done, Krista developed a
procedure to use if we ever had to reprocess the data.  (It's the file:
/home/local/proj/162/README.processing.)  After running NIMBUS to create the
new netCDF file, a skeleton program is to be run to "output correct FSSP-100,
FSSP-300, and Golden Egg temperature data" and then to merge the two files
together.  (Krista also states:  "As the high-rate skeleton programs are
presently set up and compiled, high-rate Golden Egg data are not generated.")
Is this still the case, or does the present version of NIMBUS take care of
this situation, too?

If the skeleton run and merge procedures are needed, then Jay Miller needs to
get a new data set (after I create it, of course).

I don't think we need to do merge anymore.

Darrel,

I looked at the SCMS skeleton processor directories and found a summary at
the beginning of the file "amlib.c":

/*  SCMS Skeleton Processor
    High rate data processor
    Darrel Baumgardner: February 23, 1996
    1)  Calculates FSSP-100 activity from DFSTRB and DFRSTS
    2)  Corrects concf, cfsp01-15,  and plwcf for activity
    3)  Calculates FSSP-300 activity from total counts
    4)  Corrects conc3 and cfs301-30  for activity
    5)  Calculates egg temperatures with new cal coeffs.
 */

There are 4 executable versions of the skeleton which cover RF01-RF05,
RF06-RF20 at both low and high rate.  One problem is that the source code for
both low-rate versions is missing; only the high-rate sources are present, and
there is nothing in the high-rate "amlib.c" (user code) that would show how to
modify it for the low-rate processing.  (I'm sure Chris can help with that, if
needed.)

It would seem to me that all of the PMS-correction stuff has been addressed by
the present version of NIMBUS.  What has not, in my opinion, is the golden egg.
In light of Jay's needs, perhaps we can forego processing the golden egg.

We have a different correction for 1-5 than for 6-19.  I'll try and get
a third processor set up to handle this.  I had just planned on waiting
to reprocess 6-19, then modifing the current scms processor to handle it.

Of course not, that's from the old skeleton.

We are not using the skeleton anymore, I've built the corrections into
nimbus, that is why we are using a special nimbus.

Ok, it's fixed for XGLWC.  Change the output rate of XGLWC to 1000, it will
put out garbage if you leave it at 25Hz for HRT.

Ron,
	I've set up a second processor for SCMS.  The new directories are:

 /home/local/nimbus_scms1-5
 /home/local/nimbus_scms6-19

Can you run a flight from 1-5 both LRT & HRT.  The only change is in the
FSSP-100.  Let me know when it's done so we can look at it up here.

Chris,

I have run production versions of both HRT and LRT for RF04 using the
executable file
     /home/local/nimbus_scms1-5/src/filter/nimbus

The data are in the files:
    /home/productiondata/162rf04.cdf   (21435844 bytes)
    /home/productiondata/162rf04h.cdf  (279293872 bytes)

Before running any more production I needed to free up space in
/home/productiondata.  I purged most of the 812 data (which can
be retrieved from the MSS, if needed).

I am now running production HRT for RF12.

Darrel,

Should I also plan to reprocess the LRT versions of the SCMS ferry flights
as was done in the original processing?

Jay,
   The SCMS aircraft data set is currently in the reprocessing stage after
fixing what we hope to be the last of the problems.  Your assistance in
detecting these problems has been invaluable.
   As the resource person at the RAF for microphysical measurements, I offer
my apologies for not having caught the problems in the first place and then
the extent of time it took for getting them fixed.  I take full responsibility
for both of these delays and will strive to be more responsive in the future.

   We depend a lot on users like yourself to help us catch data problems, and
since the ones that you caught were buried in the high rate processing of the
PMS data, you have been invaluable in helping us permaneently fix a problem
that won't cause us future difficulties.  SCMS was the first project where
we had sampled the 260X at high rate.  The correction algorithms had not been
compensated for the higher sample rates and introduced the erroneous data you
spotted.
   You also asked the question about the overlap between FSSP-300 and
FSSP-100.  This is an issue that I am still investigating.  The FSSP-300
was originally designed as an aerosol probe, and its optical gain and sample
volumes are different than the FSSP-100.  We know that it suffers losses in
cloud and possibly has a particle-size-dependent sample volume.  Out of cloud
it matches very well with the PCASP when we have used it in other projects,
so we think that we just need a better analysis of its performance in cloud
conditions to better understand how to process the data. 
   If you have any other questions about the data, I will try to respond as
quickly as I can.  I hope that you are still able to make the June 2 deadline
for the cloud physics conference.

Regards,

Darrel

Jay, Darrel & Chris,

This afternoon I finished reprocessing all the SCMS data, both low-rate and
high-rate.  I have archived all the production netCDF files to the SCD Mass
Store System (MSS) as bitfiles in the *temporary* directory:
     /RAF/1995/162/NEW/
At the end of this message is a MSS bitfile log for these new data.

Within the next week or so, I plan to move these bitfiles to the permanent
MSS archive directory:
     /RAF/1995/162/
Before I do that, however, I must move the archived bitfiles which now
occupy that directory path from the first production run.

I plan to move all these bitfiles in two waves:  the first will rename all
those associated with the first production run; the second will move all
the "NEW" files into their proper place.  When all that has happened, I'll
send you another email mapping the new MSS directory structure.  I hope you
won't be accessing these files during the move (which should take only a
few minutes).

Today I reprocessed RF12 (5 Aug 1995), because the previously-released
new version did not use the correct calibration constants for the Ophir
temperature probe (OAT).  There are differences between the new and the
newer, but nothing significant.

I trust you will pass this information to others that need it.

Hello Ron,

I have been in contact with both Chris Webster and Jay Miller about the SCMS
C130 data set. Chris sent me a note this morning asking if I had been
notified, via an email from you, about the completion of the reprocessing of
the SCMS C130 data. Could you please send along a copy of the details of the
reprocessed SCMS C130 data set, specifically where it is located and what
dates have been completed. I was also wondering if the APCAS data was
recoverable. In an earilier note from Chris, he suggested that the aerosol
data may not be able to be recovered.

Thank you for the information and help.

Neil,

Last Friday I sent the following email to Jay, Chris and Darrel Baumgardner
regarding my completion of the reprocessing of the SCMS data.  Please contact
Darrel <darrel@raf.atd.ucar.edu> regarding the quality of the PCAS data.  If
you have any other questions regrading this reprocessing or archive, please
contact me again.

Hello Ron,

I have been examining the values of liquid water content from the several
probes that were flown on the NCAR C130 aircraft during the SCMS project.
When examining these values on each flight during the entire project for the
old netcdf files, the values of liquid water for the FSSP seemed to be most
reasonable (nearest to adiabatic) during aircraft penetrations through the
small cumulus cores. The values varied but were slightly less or adiabatic
for a number of passes on several project days. This was comparing the
liquid water content determined from the Gerber probe, 260x probe, PMS king
probe and the FSSP for the old low-rate data set.

When conducting the same analyses for the new reprocessed low-rate data set,
I have found that the liquid water content from the FSSP is now
super-adiabatic(3-4 times the adaiabatic values) on several days. I have
only examined the low-rate data when comparing the old to reprocessed data
sets. At this point, I have examined a number of C130 flights and have found
that significant changes seemed to have primarily occurred in the FSSP
liquid water content during the July portion of the project. Specifically,
FSSP lwc values on July 26, 28, and 31 have significantly increased. But
again, I have only checked a majority of dates (july 26 - aug 13), not all
project dates.

I would appreciate it if you could please check into this and forward me a
description the changes in processing the particle probes (especially the
FSSP and 260x)that were made between the old SCMS data set and the new
reprocessed data set. It seems that the data for the 260x probe has been
corrected from the previous data set, however, significant changes in the
fssp data have occurred. Let me know if you have any questions or I can
assist in any way.

Thanks,

Neil,

I will pass your message on to Darrel, since he is primarily responsible for
all the PMS-1D code changes.  We have the archived version of the original
processing software, so it won't be too difficult to document the recent
changes, but Darrel should be familiar with both and is better equipped
to answer your questions.

Darrel,

I just received this message from Neil and thought you would be the best
person to answer his questions.  If you need the NIMBUS processor software
used for the first production run, I can resurrect it from the Mass Store
for you.  Let me know if you need other help, too.

Neil,

I gust got a reply from Darrel.  He wanted me to pass word to you that he
is just "swamped" now while participating in the SHEBA project in Alaska.
He expects to get back to you in early June.  I hope that doesn't pose too
much of a burden on you.

I used flight 12 for most of my comparisons (Aug 5th).  LWC from the FSSP
checks out about 5-10% higher for me.  How does it compare for you?

I'll look into some of those other dates.

This may be easier said than done.  Darrel used his own program to process
original data.  I have modified our regular processor to handle the lack
of activity from the FSSP-100.  I've given our code.  I can give you his,
but it won't correspond easily.....

Chris,

I just discovered another "glitch" that looks like a problem NIMBUS has
when handling "missing data."  In both the new and original SCMS RF05
(/home/productiondata/162rf05.cdf and home/data/migs/chris/162rf05.cdf)
at 16:14:47 is a single-point spike in between two "missing_values" at
the end of the 16:14:06-16:14:48 data gap.  I looked at other variables
there, and transients occur on them, too.  It looks like an artifact of
a digital filter.  At any rate, it really shouldn't be there, since, in
my opinion, those values (missing_value) should be ignored by the filters.

Chris,

I have taken a look at the low rate data for flights 8 and 12 that you
placed on anonymous ftp. I would agree that the FRNG_IBR variable seems to
have been corrected to an integer value between 0 and 3. The Fssp lwc for
flight 8 (28 july) now seems to be reasonable as well. However, the fssp lwc
for flight 12 (5-august) now shows super-adiabatic values at all levels and
appears to be nearly a factor of two greater than any fssp lwc from the
previous low rate data sets.

I would suggest that we look into this more closely before going ahead and
reprocessing the entire data set again.

Ron and Chris:

This is a followup on my last email and the one from Neil Laird about the
unusually high liquid water contents on some days in SCMS95.  

I have surveyed *all* the reprocessed low-rate probe data and conclude that 
the likely culprit is changes in the size range for the fssp-100, and possibly
the activity.  In support of this conclusion, I have tabulated summaries of all
cloud penetrations for each of the days, with the numbers under the Conc, Lwc,
and Dia columns as (new value)/(old value) in per cent.  Numbers above 100 mean
that the reprocessed (new) values are much greater than the old ones.  All days
not listed seem to have no problems, particularly all flights in August (#11-20)

                                            Size range (micron)
                                          New             Old
 Flt-date      Conc    Lwc      Dia     Dia_mn-mx      Dia_mn-mx
RF03-950721 	87	90	108	4.2-27.2	1.1-15.4
RF04-950722 	86	93	105	4.8-25.9	1.2-17.1
RF05-950724 	85	81	 99	4.5-732.0 ?	4.5-529.0 ?
RF06-950726 	88     155      168	5.6-39.9	1.6-19.9
RF07-950727 	94     300     	160	12.6-20.2	7.5-12.5
RF08-950728 	94     209      180     11.3-43.6	3.8-25.7
RF10-950731 	97     191      125	6.6-43.4	6.5-25.4

These data were processed first with Xanadu, then with a program of mine to
read listed data and compile scatter plots, histograms, and the like for my
analysis.  If the fssp size range changes while processing with Xanadu, a
message is printed out.  In the old data this message shows integer changes
such as 0 to 1, 1 to 0, 3 to 0 and the like, but not too often.  The message
for the reprocessed data shows lots of 0 to 0 (Xanadu only prints out an
integer) indicating that the size range value has changed.  Previously I
examined the variable FRNG_IBR with ncplot and found it to be more like a
floating point rather than integer value, but it was being changed.

I talked to Bob Rauber and Neil Laird this morning and we are all feeling
a sense of urgency in getting the above problem corrected and these data
reprocessed yet again.  In the mean time, the best we can do is use the
old low-rate data set for the fssp-100 and the new data set for the 260x
and fssp-300.  Your help in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Jay

Chris and Ron,

I've compared the three flights #02 (July 20), #08 (July 28), and #12 (August
05) that I pulled from the RAF anonymous ftp this morning against the original
data from the MSS (RAF/1995/162/HRT and */LRT).  I've also checked low vs. high
rate using ncplot.

I do believe that those three flights were correctly processed with *all*
previous problems no longer present.  I endorse your now proceeding with a
reprocessing of the data unless Neil Laird or someone else has found some-
thing that I didn't.

Thanks for your patience and hard work getting all the processing straightened
out.  

Jay

To all,

I have finished reprocessing (I hope for the last time) all the SCMS data,
both low-rate and high-rate.  I have archived all these new production netCDF
files to the SCD Mass Store System (MSS) as bitfiles in the *temporary*
directory:
     /RAF/1995/162/NEW/
At the end of this message is a MSS bitfile log for these new data.  Most
of the entries will be the same except for some minor bitfile size changes.
On Friday 5 June 1998, I plan to move these bitfiles to the permanent MSS
archive directory:
     /RAF/1995/162/
At that time I also will move the original archived bitfiles, which now
occupy that directory path from the first production run, to the MSS
directory:
     /RAF/1995/162/1ST_PRODUCTION/

I trust you will pass this information to others that need it.

To all,

I have finished reprocessing (I hope for the last time) all the SCMS data,
both low-rate and high-rate.  I have archived all these new production netCDF
files to the SCD Mass Store System (MSS) as bitfiles in the *temporary*
directory:
     /RAF/1995/162/NEW/
At the end of this message is a MSS bitfile log for these new data.  Most
of the entries will be the same as the original processing except for some
minor bitfile size changes.  On Friday 5 June 1998, I plan to move these
bitfiles to the permanent MSS archive directory:
     /RAF/1995/162/
At that time I also will move the original archived bitfiles, which now
occupy that directory path from the first production run, to the MSS
directory:
     /RAF/1995/162/1ST_PRODUCTION/

I trust you will pass this information to others who need it.  (Earlier
today I informed Neil Laird, Bob Rauber, Jay Miller and Harry Ochs.)

To SCMS Data Users,

RAF has completed reprocessing the complete SCMS data set (both low- and
high-rate) primarily to correct the PMS-1D data.  An added benefit was a minor
improvement to some other derived variables due to enhancements made to the
NIMBUS processing software since the first production run.

The new data set can be found in the SCMS production directories on the
SCD Mass Store System (MSS):  /RAF/1995/162/LRT/ and /RAF/1995/162/HRT/.
For reference, the original production data and support files have been
moved to the MSS directories:  /RAF/1995/162/1ST_PRODUCTION/LRT and
/RAF/1995/162/1ST_PRODUCTION/HRT.  (The MSS bitfiles were moved on
22 June 1998.)

In short, if you have been accessing SCMS data from the MSS, you will
obtain the better data by using the same paths as before, and if, for
some reason, you want to use data from the first production run, you
must use their new directories.

Some of you already have requested and received copies of the new data.
If you don't have access to the MSS and would like copies of this new data
set, please let me know.  Also, please reply if you have questions.

Hi Ron and Chris,

Could you please provide me the value for the FSSP effective beam diameter?
This is the variable that is important for calculating the FSSP sample
area. I have been unable to find a value for it and since it is directly
used by RAF to determine the FSSP sample areas I am contacting you. If the
FSSP effective beam diameter changes from project to project, I am
particularly interested in the FSSP-100 during SCMS. Also if it changes for
FSSP resolution, I would be interested in obtaining the values for each
resolution.

thanks,
Neil

0.19.  Should be in the netCDF file.  "ncdump -h 162rfXX.cdf | grep FSSP"

Chris,

I just talked with Krista about your reprocessing of the LRT and HRT data for
SCMS.  We know that the previous processing had errors, but before choosing
the exact MSS path for archiving these new files, we would like you to tell
us what changes you made to "fix" the data.  That will help us determine the
best path for archiving the data.

Thanks.

The latest 1 second data is available for flight 17 via anonymous ftp @
raf.atd.ucar.edu, cd pub/tmp/chris 162rf17.cdf.  I can make HRT
available also.


To recap our findings:

 - The transitTime addition to TAU is used in conjunction with a lower
scaling factor for sampleVolume (.55 instead of .71).

 - Because the probe's housekeeping card was broken *TOTAL* resets and
strobes were wired around.  Activity calculation I have wants *FAST*
resets.  Hence Darrel's compution of activity with TAU2 *
(resets-strobes).

The latest graph has been added to the bottom of
http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/~chris/scms.html.  Basically shows Darrel's
orginal processing was correct (not that it was in doubt).


Recap processing history:

  We did the second processing when it was discovered that processing
for the 260X was walking through the raw data 62 bins at a time, not the
required 64.  At that time it seemed easier (to me) to modify the
processor to handle the work-arounds for the FSSP.  Two/three mistakes
were made:
  1) the 25Hz strobes and resets were incorrectly averaged down to 10Hz.
  2) Activity was incorrectly computed
      a) because we assumed the DFRSTS variable was FAST resets, not TOTAL.
      b) I used the previous second's resets and strobes.

  We started looking into a third processing when Sonia discovered a
"tic" in the concentrations at the entry of every cloud, we realized
that DFSTRB and DFRSTS were 1/10 of second different in time from the
rest of the FSSP-100 data (due to the broken housekeeping card).  The
above listed problems were then brought to light when Fred claimed that
our activity was full of shit.

Chris,

I have archived all the netCDF files in the directory /jnet/data/SCMS to the
SCD Mass Store System (MSS).  Below is a new "taplog" file that describes

Now that I've archived the data, should I also archive the NIMBUS processor

I have finished archiving to the MSS the first 5 SCMS flights.
They are in the interim directory:
     /RAF/1995/162/NEW/

Over the next few days I plan to rework the MSS archive (moving bitfiles
around) and to archive the current group of local support files for this
project including the NIMBUS processors.

The general plan is to move pertinent files from the first reprocessing
(currently in our production directory) into a new MSS directory:
     /RAF/1995/162/  -->  /RAF/1995/162/2ND_PRODUCTION

Following that, I will move the latest reprocessing into our production
directory:
     /RAF/1995/162/NEW/  -->  /RAF/1995/162/

I may not finish this operation until sometime next week.

I don't have a mailing list for SCMS, but I do have a list of data recipients
known to me.  (There probably are more.)  It can be found as the file:
   /usr/local/proj/162/Production/recipients

After we finished reprocessing the first time on 17 July 1998 I sent a message
to the following people announcing the release of the then "new" data set:
  knightc@ucar.edu
  krista (Krista Laursen)
  darrel (Darrel Baumgardner)
  ljmill@ucar.edu
  blyth@kestrel.nmt.edu
  brad@kestrel.nmt.edu
  rodi@badger.uwyo.edu
  jchu@captain.sc.whecn.edu
  jean-louis.brenguier@meteo.fr
  Bruno.PIGUET@meteo.fr
  hudson@sage.dri.edu
  larson@MIT.EDU
  P.G.Duynkerke@fys.ruu.nl
  raga@nefelos.atmosfcu.unam.mx
  gerber@access.digex.net

I suppose we should contact all of the above and add:
  r-rauber@uiuc.edu (Bob Rauber)
  n-laird@uiuc.edu (Neil Laird)
  ljmill@ncar.ucar.edu (Jay Miller)

plus any others you recommend.

I suggest that we get all the MSS bitfiles settled in their "final" resting
places before broadcasting a message to all.  It also would be well to compose
a "cover letter" explaining what was done this time and why it is now the
definitive data set people should be using.  In the file:
     /usr/local/proj/162/Production/reprocess.notes
toward the bottom is the heading:
   "Second reprocessing of SCMS data by Chris Webster"
where I paraphrased what you sent me in an email message on
Wed, 20 Dec 2000 14:25:36 -0700.  I don't know if that is all we need.

Who is Fred?

Chris,

I reworked the Mass Store Archive and created a 2ND_PRODUCTION directory.
All files have been moved around to their final destinations.  I still have
some cleanup work to do.  The latest data can be found in the MSS paths:
   /RAF/1995/162/HRT/
   /RAF/1995/162/LRT/

Hi Ron,

I was wondering if the SCMS files from the latest reprocessing that
Chris did a
few months ago are all on the Cray now.  If they are, could you send me
and the
other SCMS participants their location?  A sentence or two of
explanation about
why the reprocessing was done would also be helpful to my SCMS
colleagues,
some of whom are unaware of the reprocessing.

Thanks,
Sonia

Sonia,

Thanks for your message.  I apologize for the delay in getting the word out
to everyone.

The latest reprocessed data files were archived to the SCD Mass Store System
(MSS) on 15 March 2001 and are available there.  I moved the previous files
to another directory, so the following MSS path has the current data:
     /RAF/1995/162/HRT/             <-- high-rate data
     /RAF/1995/162/LRT/             <--  low-rate data
     /RAF/1995/162/reprocess.notes
     /RAF/1995/162/taplog.162       <-- current bitfile log

The previous versions of the files can be found in the directory paths:
     /RAF/1995/162/1ST_PRODUCTION/  <-- original processing
     /RAF/1995/162/2ND_PRODUCTION/  <-- first reprocessing

The file "reprocess.notes" has my notes on all the reprocessing that has
been done with this data set.  One paragraph describes the current status
of the processing and why the production data were regenerated:

  "Second reprocessing of SCMS data by Chris Webster:
   -------------------------------------------------
    When doing the first reprocessing, it was discovered that processing
    for the 260X was walking through the raw data 62 bins at a time, not the
    required 64.  At that time it seemed easier (to me) to modify the
    processor to handle the work-arounds for the FSSP.  Two/three mistakes
    were made:
      1) the 25Hz strobes and resets were incorrectly averaged down to 10Hz.
      2) Activity was incorrectly computed
          a) because we assumed the DFRSTS variable was FAST resets, not TOTAL.
          b) I used the previous second's resets and strobes.
    We started looking into a second reprocessing when Sonia [Lasher-Trapp]
    discovered a "tic" in the concentrations at the entry of every cloud.
    We realized that DFSTRB and DFRSTS were 1/10 of second different in time
    from the rest of the FSSP-100 data (due to the broken housekeeping card).
    The above listed problems were then brought to light when Fred claimed
    that our ACTIVITY was [totally bogus]."

Below is the latest MSS bitfile log.

    The above listed problems were then brought to light when Fred claimed
    that our ACTIVITY was [totally bogus]."

Below is the latest MSS bitfile log.

Thanks for your message.  I apologize for the delay in getting the word out
to everyone.

The latest reprocessed data files were archived to the SCD Mass Store System
(MSS) on 15 March 2001 and are available there.  I moved the previous files
to another directory, so the following MSS path has the current data:
     /RAF/1995/162/HRT/             <-- high-rate data
     /RAF/1995/162/LRT/             <--  low-rate data
     /RAF/1995/162/reprocess.notes
     /RAF/1995/162/taplog.162       <-- current bitfile log

The previous versions of the files can be found in the directory paths:
     /RAF/1995/162/1ST_PRODUCTION/  <-- original processing
     /RAF/1995/162/2ND_PRODUCTION/  <-- first reprocessing

The file "reprocess.notes" has my notes on all the reprocessing that has
been done with this data set.  One paragraph describes the current status
of the processing and why the production data were regenerated:

  "Second reprocessing of SCMS data by Chris Webster:
   -------------------------------------------------
    When doing the first reprocessing, it was discovered that processing
    for the 260X was walking through the raw data 62 bins at a time, not the
    required 64.  At that time it seemed easier (to me) to modify the
    processor to handle the work-arounds for the FSSP.  Two/three mistakes
    were made:
      1) the 25Hz strobes and resets were incorrectly averaged down to 10Hz.
      2) Activity was incorrectly computed
          a) because we assumed the DFRSTS variable was FAST resets, not TOTAL.
          b) I used the previous second's resets and strobes.
    We started looking into a second reprocessing when Sonia [Lasher-Trapp]
    discovered a "tic" in the concentrations at the entry of every cloud.
    We realized that DFSTRB and DFRSTS were 1/10 of second different in time
    from the rest of the FSSP-100 data (due to the broken housekeeping card).
    The above listed problems were then brought to light when Fred claimed
    that our ACTIVITY was [totally bogus]."

Below is the latest MSS bitfile log.

Hi Ron,

I was wondering if the SCMS files from the latest reprocessing that
Chris did a
few months ago are all on the Cray now.  If they are, could you send me
and the
other SCMS participants their location?  A sentence or two of
explanation about
why the reprocessing was done would also be helpful to my SCMS
colleagues,
some of whom are unaware of the reprocessing.

Thanks,
Sonia

Sonia,

Thanks for your message.  I apologize for the delay in getting the word out
to everyone.

The latest reprocessed data files were archived to the SCD Mass Store System
(MSS) on 15 March 2001 and are available there.  I moved the previous files
to another directory, so the following MSS path has the current data:
     /RAF/1995/162/HRT/             <-- high-rate data
     /RAF/1995/162/LRT/             <--  low-rate data
     /RAF/1995/162/reprocess.notes
     /RAF/1995/162/taplog.162       <-- current bitfile log

The previous versions of the files can be found in the directory paths:
     /RAF/1995/162/1ST_PRODUCTION/  <-- original processing
     /RAF/1995/162/2ND_PRODUCTION/  <-- first reprocessing

The file "reprocess.notes" has my notes on all the reprocessing that has
been done with this data set.  One paragraph describes the current status
of the processing and why the production data were regenerated:

  "Second reprocessing of SCMS data by Chris Webster:
   -------------------------------------------------
    When doing the first reprocessing, it was discovered that processing
    for the 260X was walking through the raw data 62 bins at a time, not the
    required 64.  At that time it seemed easier (to me) to modify the
    processor to handle the work-arounds for the FSSP.  Two/three mistakes
    were made:
      1) the 25Hz strobes and resets were incorrectly averaged down to 10Hz.
      2) Activity was incorrectly computed
          a) because we assumed the DFRSTS variable was FAST resets, not TOTAL.
          b) I used the previous second's resets and strobes.
    We started looking into a second reprocessing when Sonia [Lasher-Trapp]
    discovered a "tic" in the concentrations at the entry of every cloud.
    We realized that DFSTRB and DFRSTS were 1/10 of second different in time
    from the rest of the FSSP-100 data (due to the broken housekeeping card).
    The above listed problems were then brought to light when Fred claimed
    that our ACTIVITY was [totally bogus]."

Below is the latest MSS bitfile log.
