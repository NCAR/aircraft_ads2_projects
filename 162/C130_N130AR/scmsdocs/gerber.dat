          PVM DATA REDUCTION FOR SCMS (11/1/95, H.Gerber)


1. Introduction

        The PVM-100A produced LWC and PSA (particle surface area)
measurements during most flights of the C-130 during SCMS. Proper
offset removal and scaling of the raw voltages of each of these
channels is required to obtain LWC (g/m^3) and PSA (cm^2/m^3).
The ratio of LWC/PSA times 30,000 equals the effective droplet
radius, Re (um). The roll off in the sensitivity of this PVM probe
starts for droplets about 45 um in diameter. Thus, total LWC, total
PSA, and total Re must be derived by combining the PVM outputs
with similar outputs from other probes, e.g., 1-D or 2-D PMS probes.



2. Scaling and Offsets

        Calibration checks of the PVM showed that the raw voltages
of the LWC and PSA channels must be multiplied by the following factors:
        Multiply LWC raw voltages by 1.045.
        Multiply PSA raw voltages by 0.950.

        Scaling constants convert the voltages to parameters with the
proper scaling.
        Multiply LWC voltages by 1.00 to get LWC in g/m^3.
        Multiply PSA voltages by 2,980 to get PSA in cm^2/m^3.

        Both LWC and PSA channels showed voltage offsets from 0.0 V.
These offsets must be removed before scaling the voltages.
        The offset in the LWC channel is nearly constant during each
flight, thus the same offset can be removed from all LWC voltages on
that flight. Do not calculate the offset during the intitial rapid
ascent of the C-130 on each flight; the offset changes during this
initial period.
        The offset in the PSA channel is noisy and drifts. For best
results in using this channel, calculate the offset for each cloud pass.
Use the average of the offsets observed just before and after each
cloud penetration.


3. 1-Hz Data Availability
        Usable 1 Hz LWC and PSA data is available for all flights
except for the following flights or intervals of flights:
        Flight 3 - PVM not on the C-130
        Flight 5 - Water condensed on PVM lenses during the intitial
                   rapid ascent of the C-130. Disregard measurements
                   from 12:58 to about 13:30.
        Flight 7 - Data logger problems.
        Flights 9, 15, 18 - No clouds intercepted.
        All Flights - Just following the initial rapid ascent of
                   the C-130 on each flight, the LWC channel usually
                   shows a dip in its output; disregard this dip.



4. 1000-Hz Data Availability
        The LWC channel of the PVM was also recorded at 1000 Hz, and
the PSA channel at several hundred Hz (check with NCAR for the exact
PSA rate.) The LWC data is high quality, and is available for all
flights, except those noted in the preceding Section 3. In addition,
Flights 1 and 2 have excessive high frequency noise in both LWC and
PSA channels, making this data unusable.


5. 1000-Hz Data Interpretation
        The use of the 1000-Hz LWC data for analyzing fine-scale
structures in the clouds requires the understanding of the relationship
between the finite sampling volume (1.25 cm^3) of the PVM and the
noise caused by the Poissonian sampling statistics.
        The PVM has a "effective" sampling volume larger than 1.25 cm^3,
because of finite electronic time response of the instrument. This
response is presently being quantified in the laboratory, and the
results will be made available to those who are interested. Please
