Bruce:

	Be aware that we have changed the static pressure sensors on the 
	C-130.  The Rosemount 1221 unit has be taken out of the plumbing
	loop for PSF and replaced with the new Ruska digital unit XPSFD.
	The output from PSF is really PCAB and needs to be renamed in the 
	Solar Corona header, address & cal Coeffs stay the same.  In the 
	new NIMBUS upgrade you will be getting, XPSFD will be changed to PSF
	which will still bring in the corrected calculation PSFC.

   Bruce Morley left me a voice mail saying the CORONA project guys would 
lkie to have the calculation for geting from TAS to IAS. I think that is 
what he wanted. Maybe he wanted the calculation for IAS. I don't suppose that
we calculate IAS from TAS. If this is true just give Bruce the calculation
for IAS. Probably ought to talk to Bruce.

Bruce,

Here are the equations (in C code format) that NIMBUS uses for calculating
indicated airspeed (IAS) in knots, true airspeed (TAS) in m/s and Mach number
squared.  As can be seen, a number of separate measurements must be made.

I suppose one can invert these equations (with difficulty) to obtain an
indicated airspeed.  Given a true airspeed at a specific altitude, one
has to estimate a static air temperature (perhaps from a model or a recent
sounding).  At this point, there are two unknowns that must be found:
total air temperature and dynamic pressure.  The equations are such that one
affects the other, so a recursive process probably is needed to zero in on
the final values, after which one can calculate the indicated airspeed from
the resulting dynamic pressure.


Indicated Airspeed (IAS)
------------------------
     IAS = 1.94253479 * 760.9166 *
        sqrt(fabs(pow(((1013.246 + qcxc) / 1013.246), 0.28571) - 1.0));

      where:  sqrt = square root
              fabs = absolute value
              pow  = first argument taken to the power of the second argument
              qcxc = corrected dynamic (pitot) presure (mbar)
              1.94253479 = conversion factor from m/s to knots


True Airspeed (TAS)
-------------------
     TAS = sqrt((t + 273.16) * (401.86 / (1.0 / xm2 + 0.2 * r)));

      where:  sqrt = square root
              t    = total air temperature (recovery temperature, actually) (C)
              xm2  = Mach number squared
              r    = temperature sensor's recovery factor
                      (usually 0.95 to 0.98 for Rosemount temperature probes)


Mach Number Squared (xm2)
-------------------------
     xm2 = (5.0 * (pow((a+1.0), 0.28571) - 1.0));

      where:  a = qcxc/psxc
              qcxc = corrected dynamic pressure (mbar)
              psxc = corrected static (barometric) pressure (mbar)

Everyone,

Some press from the public affairs office of Howard AFB in Panama.

whether anyone needed a low-density Exabyte tape.  I'm assume everyone

We will be sending you an exabyte tape with the processed aircraft data from
the flights in Panama.  Our default density is a high density (~5 Gbytes) tape.
If this presents a problem, please contact me or Ron Ruth (ruth@ucar.edu)
about obtaining a copy of the data.
