 - Sanitized the entire line

  [GMT 09/08/05 16:33:32] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> It almost looks like pqexpire (in the check-on-a-regular-basis mode) doesn't remove anything.  I'm going to send email to Unidata and ask if they know what pqexpire *really* does.
  [GMT 09/08/05 16:35:50] <anstett-jeffco> When I checked malbec yesterday, therewere over 1000 products in the queue.  I restarted the ldm and pqexpire was running, but it only expired the images when I ran pqexpire from the command line.The queue went from over 1000 images to 2!  It appears that pqexpire does work in a check-on-a-regular-basis mode but just not from the config file for some reason.
  [GMT 09/08/05 16:37:22] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> So when you start pqexpire by hand, it cleans the queue of old images and continues to keep it clean, or just cleans things once when you first start it?
  [GMT 09/08/05 16:38:18] <anstett-jeffco> I think it was keeping the queue clean, but I'll have to check that again to make sure.  I'll start it again on malbecand let you know.
  [GMT 09/08/05 16:40:12] <anstett-jeffco> I just started it on malbec from the command line and know there are 5 products in the queue, 4 data files and 1 composite image.
