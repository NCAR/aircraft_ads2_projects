[GMT 09/23/05 17:55:57] <MikeDaniels-home> ok, thx and we haven't received the special high power wall wart or whatever it is, correct?
[GMT 09/23/05 17:56:41] <lmurphy> I just picked up the so-called battery elimiator.
[GMT 09/23/05 17:56:52] <ads-nrlp3> Yes! That is correct!
[GMT 09/23/05 17:57:24] ChrisBurghart-GV (burghart@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left &NRLP3 (Leaving).
[GMT 09/23/05 17:57:47] <lmurphy> I don't think that they will help. They are not an actual battery replacement but a 12V charger.

[GMT 09/23/05 17:58:18] <MikeDaniels-home> larry, oh i see.
[GMT 09/23/05 17:58:50] <lmurphy> The more I see, the more I believe that these "shut-down" have nothing to do with the battery.
[GMT 09/23/05 17:59:13] <MikeDaniels-home> oh?  you just think the phones are bad?
[GMT 09/23/05 17:59:21] <ads-nrlp3> Larry, How the battery eliminator look like?
[GMT 09/23/05 18:00:10] <MikeDaniels-home> or that we're using them in such an unusual way compared to most?
[GMT 09/23/05 18:01:05] <lmurphy> I think that if the "shutdowns" were battery related then the phone would continue to shutdown after you turned it back on. The same thing happens on both phones regardless of the battery that has been in them.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:01:59] <MikeDaniels-home> good point
[GMT 09/23/05 18:01:59] <lmurphy> I do not know if the phone is bad or not.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:02:01] <ads-nrlp3> Larry,that 12v charger become useless oh well!
[GMT 09/23/05 18:02:27] <lmurphy> I think so. I will have to look at the manual.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:06:07] <ads-nrlp3> I donot think the phone is bad.It must be something to do with connector seatting
[GMT 09/23/05 18:08:11] <lmurphy> Mike, I had the experience (rf07) where the phone shut of twice within a 5 min period. The 2nd time I turned it back on, it ran for over 3 hrs.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:08:48] <MikeDaniels-home> larry: how weird
[GMT 09/23/05 18:09:08] <MikeDaniels-home> (knock on wood) it has really been doing weel the last few flights, though
[GMT 09/23/05 18:11:02] <lmurphy> We even had a couple of disconnects sitting on the tarmac yesterday before the flight.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:11:38] <MikeDaniels-home> and the phone turned off during those?
[GMT 09/23/05 18:11:54] <ads-nrlp3> We are flying in the rough condition now .Iridium jst disconnected.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:12:07] <MikeDaniels-home> then how are you typing? :-)
[GMT 09/23/05 18:12:23] <lmurphy> By disconnect, I mean dropping the call and having to redial. But not shut down.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:12:31] <MikeDaniels-home> ok
[GMT 09/23/05 18:14:20] <lmurphy> If the iridium disconnected, how come we didn't see the users drop off?
[GMT 09/23/05 18:14:32] <MikeDaniels-home> i saw one in &RAINEX
[GMT 09/23/05 18:15:29] <BobHouze-Ops> the scientists all dropped off in &RAINEX
[GMT 09/23/05 18:15:54] <lmurphy> If you are running 2 channels, does it only show up in one of them.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:16:11] <pavel-jeffco> Its because chat overheated, not iridium...
[GMT 09/23/05 18:16:30] <MikeDaniels-home> but ads-nrlp3 did not drop!
[GMT 09/23/05 18:16:36] <lmurphy> OH...???
[GMT 09/23/05 18:16:50] <JimMoore-Ops> pavel-jeffco, explain what you mean overheated please??
[GMT 09/23/05 18:17:10] <pavel-jeffco> just kidding...
[GMT 09/23/05 18:17:51] <lmurphy> That's what I was asking, Mike.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:18:21] <MikeDaniels-home> the disconnect should show up in both channels
[GMT 09/23/05 18:18:35] <lmurphy> That what I thought.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:18:49] <MikeDaniels-home> there is a timeout that must be exceeded
[GMT 09/23/05 18:19:01] <lmurphy> Ok
[GMT 09/23/05 18:19:38] <MikeDaniels-home> my guess is that ta sent his msg *just before* the iridium disconnect and sense iridium came right back up, the disconnect was not long enough to invoke the timeout
[GMT 09/23/05 18:19:41] <MikeDaniels-home> make sense?
[GMT 09/23/05 18:20:53] <pavel-jeffco> yes. btw, I see no LF image mention - does it mean all is working fine?
[GMT 09/23/05 18:21:48] <MikeDaniels-home> i ASSume so ;-)
[GMT 09/23/05 18:23:00] <MikeDaniels-home> i'm sure we would have heard something by now
[GMT 09/23/05 18:23:26] <JimMoore-Ops> MikeDaniels-home, You are right Sir
[GMT 09/23/05 18:23:29] <MikeDaniels-home> we've got burghart flying around in the g-v, too
[GMT 09/23/05 18:23:49] <MikeDaniels-home> just in case
[GMT 09/23/05 18:24:35] <MikeDaniels-home> thx, Jim
[GMT 09/23/05 18:24:58] <ads-nrlp3> IT not true,my message was get through even iridium still say:calling
[GMT 09/23/05 18:25:06] <MikeDaniels-home> btw, they are experimenting with the sending of G-V data to the ground -- at its full time series rate!
[GMT 09/23/05 18:25:52] <pavel-jeffco> Don't advertise it too much or they will request we ferry it to the Gulf.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:26:20] <MikeDaniels-home> yes, that is true.  we did say that we are "testing' the data xfer for progressive science missions
[GMT 09/23/05 18:26:29] <MikeDaniels-home> i am glad that chat works today, at least
[GMT 09/23/05 18:26:41] <MikeDaniels-home> they are debugging problems through chat as we speak
[GMT 09/23/05 18:26:58] <JimMoore-Ops> MikeDaniels-home, I was just getting to that--should I come up on G5 and ask the question--just for fun??
[GMT 09/23/05 18:27:18] <MikeDaniels-home> jim, that would be good -- the the room is called &G5
[GMT 09/23/05 18:27:39] <MikeDaniels-home> you would like to see their track in the miami ops center
[GMT 09/23/05 18:27:51] <lmurphy> Ta, does it still say "calling"?
