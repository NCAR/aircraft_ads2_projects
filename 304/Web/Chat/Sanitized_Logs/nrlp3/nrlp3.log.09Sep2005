[GMT 09/09/05 12:58:55] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Okay.  I wonder what the problem is.  If it keeps giving you fits I guess you might want to put the battery back in.  I wonder if it is not more susceptible to power dropouts without the battery in it? Let me know that you get this message please.
[GMT 09/09/05 12:59:22] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Glad to see your back up.

[GMT 09/09/05 13:12:03] <MikeDaniels-DIA> did chat come back quickly?
[GMT 09/09/05 13:15:13] <ads-nrlp3> No, iridium stayed up that time, it was only chat. Chat reconnected in approx 2-3 min
[GMT 09/09/05 13:15:50] <MikeDaniels-DIA> that is weird
[GMT 09/09/05 13:16:01] <MikeDaniels-DIA> so only the chat clients disconnected?
[GMT 09/09/05 13:16:13] <Jcowan-Tampa> Greg, have you put the battery back in yet?  Or has the phone stayed on after takeoff?
[GMT 09/09/05 13:19:46] <ads-nrlp3> No, I have not put the battery back in yet, Iridium has styed up since takeoff,  and yes only the chat disconnected the last time
[GMT 09/09/05 13:21:45] <Jcowan-Tampa> Thanks Greg, Kurt is wanting to know how the phone if preforming.  I'm leaving it in your capable hands.  I'll monitor for another hour or so before I leave. Here is you need me.

[GMT 09/09/05 16:39:52] Action: ChrisBurghart-Boulder is away: off to do other work for about 30 min.
[GMT 09/09/05 16:49:58] <ads-nrlp3> Hey John,  I put the battery back in the phone and it is working better, but it still had 1 loss of power
[GMT 09/09/05 16:51:31] <ads-nrlp3> Also QCR seems to be very sluggish in reponding compared to Qcf.  Turned the heat on a couple of times but it didn't seem to make much difference.  
[GMT 09/09/05 16:57:39] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Okay, I'm glad that the phone is working better.  Did you go through a bunch of water just before QCR started to mess up?
[GMT 09/09/05 17:02:17] <ads-nrlp3> No I don't believe so.
[GMT 09/09/05 17:04:26] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Okay.  I guess we will just have to wait and see what the PM's say after the flight.  Are QCF and QCR at the same levels?

[GMT 09/09/05 18:13:02] <jcowan-tampa> Greg, I talked with Jorgen.  He said that if the difference between QCR and QCF is greater then 1 mb then there is a problem.  If there is greater then a 1 mb difference he requests that in the ferry home that a 2 minute reverse heading is done. That would be fly 2 min in one directions do a 90/270 then fly 2 minutes in the other direction. If the difference is less the 1 mb there is water in the lines. Let me know that you get this please.
[GMT 09/09/05 18:13:38] <jcowan-tampa> Greg I will leave for the base at 1430L even if I have not heard back from you.
