[GMT 09/06/05 19:06:53] <ads-nrlp3> Hey Greg, just saw one of those satphone dropouts.  When I went back there it was off.  Is that what you saw on your last flight?
[GMT 09/06/05 19:12:50] <bruning-Tampa> Yes, it was off after every time it dropped out
[GMT 09/06/05 19:13:49] <bruning-Tampa> I am assuming that the charge is still up around 2 or 3 bars?
[GMT 09/06/05 19:16:18] <ads-nrlp3> Okay,  You might giver Kurt a call and let him know that charging the phone n\made no difference, and that consistantly we find the phone in an OFF condidtion.  Maybe that will spark an idea with the company that makes it.

[GMT 09/06/05 19:22:14] <ads-nrlp3> The ca=harge still has 3 bars and the signal is at strength 5.  I can see no rerason for the dropouts.  We were no in the storm, but flying over Miami when this dropout occured.
[GMT 09/06/05 19:23:35] <bruning-Tampa> okay

[GMT 09/06/05 19:37:13] <bruning-Tampa> John, I talked to Kurt and he is going to give the phone makers another call
[GMT 09/06/05 19:37:34] <bruning-Tampa> It looks lke it dropped again.

[GMT 09/06/05 19:49:53] <ads-nrlp3> Greg, back up now. It's really giving us fits today.  Signal strength is at 4 or 5 and the battery is still at 3 bars.  I hvae seen both dropped calls and the phone turn off.  I don't know what to suggest anymore.

[GMT 09/06/05 19:51:04] <bruning-Tampa> Ok, I talked to kurt and he is going to call the phone makers again.
[GMT 09/06/05 19:51:36] <ads-nrlp3> Mike Bell said that it was dropping out on the ramp as well.  The problems today are much worse then on your flight.
[GMT 09/06/05 19:52:05] <bruning-Tampa> Yes it sure seems that way
[GMT 09/06/05 19:54:01] <bruning-Tampa> You said it has also dropped calls without dropping out the phone?
[GMT 09/06/05 19:57:03] science2-nrlp3 (science@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Ping timeout
[GMT 09/06/05 20:02:04] <ads-nrlp3> That is correct.  I have seen ACtracker go to the calling position, then looked at the phone and it was showing a blinking Data Call In Progress like it does when it starts a call.
[GMT 09/06/05 20:02:04] <ads-nrlp3> We have seen alot of that before with the old phones. still seems strange to be seeing it agon now.
[GMT 09/06/05 20:02:10] <ads-nrlp3> We are strapped in so I cannot check the phone.
[GMT 09/06/05 20:02:30] <bruning-Tampa> ok
