[GMT 09/09/05 17:14:10] <EldoraOp-P3> just a few dropouts. restarting scan fixes the occasional problem
[GMT 09/09/05 17:15:53] <GordonFarquharson-Tampa> How's the aft transmitter holding up - is it switching to standby like last time ?
[GMT 09/09/05 17:18:08] <EldoraOp-P3> tightening the door latch took care of that problem

[GMT 09/09/05 18:54:23] <ericloew-ncar> Hi mike, Gordon tells me that the R.P. is dropping beams. Can you provide more info?
[GMT 09/09/05 18:54:41] <EldoraOp-P3> let me get Mike, one sec
[GMT 09/09/05 18:57:53] <EldoraOp-P3> mike here, we   are getting dropped beams reported on processor and vx terminals. display goes to spokes
[GMT 09/09/05 18:58:22] <EldoraOp-P3> restarting the scan has fixed problem every time.
[GMT 09/09/05 18:59:12] <EldoraOp-P3> dropped beams seem to have no relation to flight bumps, etc
[GMT 09/09/05 19:00:15] <ericloew-ncar> So you are dropping a significant number of beams then? Are there error msgs in hskp window?
[GMT 09/09/05 19:01:50] <EldoraOp-P3> when beams start dropping it is continuous until scan is stopped. proc and hskp both report drops
[GMT 09/09/05 19:03:00] <ericloew-ncar> Mike, can you scroll up in both fore and aft processor windows and see if either processor had an out of sync message?
[GMT 09/09/05 19:03:21] <EldoraOp-P3> sometimes hskp and only one proc reports errors 
[GMT 09/09/05 19:04:34] <EldoraOp-P3> since one proc can keep displaying ok i think it is the hskp. maybe need to reseat some boards,
[GMT 09/09/05 19:04:59] <EldoraOp-P3> not getting any out of sync msg
[GMT 09/09/05 19:07:11] <EldoraOp-P3> mostly happens in fore, maybe a temp problem, but it is not hot in plane
[GMT 09/09/05 19:07:30] BobHouze-Ops (houze@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Quit: Signing off
[GMT 09/09/05 19:08:17] <ericloew-ncar> Mike, the out of sync message can occur quite some time before you might notice that beams are being dropped on a regular basis. It only occurs one time -- not continuously. So, you need to scroll the window to check past history. Every time I've seen this problem, one of the processors lost sync and stopped because of it.
[GMT 09/09/05 19:09:48] <ericloew-ncar> If the problem occurs again, check if on of the Processors has stopped -- no blinking light on Collator and some lights turned off (I think).
[GMT 09/09/05 19:10:42] <ericloew-ncar> I'm fairly certain it's not the housekeeper.
[GMT 09/09/05 19:14:00] <EldoraOp-P3> ok, seems to be proc specific most of the time. not often do both spoke at same time, but it has happened
[GMT 09/09/05 19:19:39] <EldoraOp-P3> have no sync warnings. several "no midbeam interupt received", no endo f beam interupt received"., complaining dropping beams because queue is full, 
[GMT 09/09/05 19:22:58] <ericloew-ncar> The no-midbeam interrupt and no end of beam interrupts received are usually a sign that the processor has stopped for some reason. An sync error or a loss of 60 MHz is typical. The queue fills because without interrupts the Vxworks host doesn't send beams out the network.
[GMT 09/09/05 19:25:55] <EldoraOp-P3> not seeing sync errors,
[GMT 09/09/05 19:26:41] <EldoraOp-P3> will keep an eye on proc lights next time,. this day is done. will be on gnd in 20 min
[GMT 09/09/05 19:28:16] <ericloew-ncar> At this point, I suggest re-seating 9U signal processing cards. It wasn't done before the start of the project to my knowledge and it is something we usually end up doing out of necessity.
[GMT 09/09/05 19:30:44] <EldoraOp-P3> not sure of flt plans for tomorrow. will try to get done soon.
[GMT 09/09/05 19:34:01] <EldoraOp-P3> eric, we also had several 3 or 4 gnd faults on the servo amp today
[GMT 09/09/05 19:34:33] <EldoraOp-P3> 2 faults came a half hour apart, others were single events.
[GMT 09/09/05 19:40:26] <ericloew-ncar> Have a look at the servo amp manual and check on the possible causes of a ground fault. We may have grounding problem with the motor. This wasn't checked after the brushes were replaced.
[GMT 09/09/05 19:41:52] <EldoraOp-P3> ok, time to land
[GMT 09/09/05 19:43:41] <ericloew-ncar> have fun!
