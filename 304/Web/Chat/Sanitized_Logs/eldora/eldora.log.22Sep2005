[GMT 09/22/05 16:46:19] <BradSmull-NRL> Gordon--message from Tom (whispered so ELDORA won't hear):  ELDORA is working splendidly
[GMT 09/22/05 16:46:22] Nick change: DeannaHence-ops -> Deanna-ops
[GMT 09/22/05 16:54:49] <GordonFarquharson-Boulder> Brad: Thanks very much for the news. We figured that no news is good news, but it's nice to hear that it is so.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:55:23] <GordonFarquharson-Boulder> Brad: How's the turbulence today ?
[GMT 09/22/05 17:06:31] <BradSmull-NRL> Gordon--it was quite intense (read "moderate") as we entered the NE side of the storm and penetrated outer randbands. ELDORA stayed up continuously during that period
[GMT 09/22/05 17:06:50] <BradSmull-NRL> Now, nearer the center of the storm, things are smoother and ELDORA continues to function well
[GMT 09/22/05 17:07:17] <BradSmull-NRL> Tom wanted to keep you guys posted--he's happy! (So are the scientists...)
[GMT 09/22/05 17:11:10] <GordonFarquharson-Boulder> Happy scientists - that's what we like to hear !
