[GMT 08/27/05 15:40:15] <EldoraOp-P3> hi eric was off chat for a while
[GMT 08/27/05 15:40:52] <EldoraOp-P3> had a good ferry yesterday. only a couple problems. 
[GMT 08/27/05 15:41:37] <MikeDaniels-home> pretty good, eric -- were you at pax?
[GMT 08/27/05 15:41:57] <EldoraOp-P3> yesterday aft tx faulted with vac-ion undervolt. same time lost serial comm to aft tx.
[GMT 08/27/05 15:42:18] <EldoraOp-P3> had to recycle power on aft tx.
[GMT 08/27/05 15:42:32] <MikeDaniels-home> oops, I see EldoraOp-P3 is *Mike* Strong.  My bad
[GMT 08/27/05 15:43:11] ericloew-tampa (ericloew@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Ping timeout
[GMT 08/27/05 15:43:28] <EldoraOp-P3> will be forgiven if you disclose how you can output in red 
[GMT 08/27/05 15:45:12] <MikeDaniels-home> maybe i should tell you how to change the nick to MikeStrong-NRLP3 instead :-)
[GMT 08/27/05 15:47:17] <EldoraOp-P3> i know. who is operating eldora is on a need to know basis. :-)
[GMT 08/27/05 15:47:55] <MikeDaniels-home> just a sec, i will explain the color changes

[GMT 08/27/05 15:49:38] <MikeEldora-P3> hi eric i will retype yesterday info if necessary. did you miss my earlier?
[GMT 08/27/05 15:50:07] <ericloew-tampa> yes, the computer restarted after a windows update. Grrr!!!
[GMT 08/27/05 15:51:05] <MikeEldora-P3> ok. the ferry was good. had an aft tx vac ion uv fault. same time lost comm to aft tx.
[GMT 08/27/05 15:51:26] <MikeEldora-P3> had to cycle power to aft tx to get comm back.
[GMT 08/27/05 15:52:33] <ericloew-tampa> Do you know when and where the nrl-P3 will land today?
[GMT 08/27/05 15:53:17] <MikeDaniels-home> to change the color to red, put a "% C 0 4" (no spaces) before the text you want to be red.  Then put a "% C 0 0" after that to change the color back to white
[GMT 08/27/05 15:53:26] <MikeDaniels-home> on that same line
[GMT 08/27/05 15:54:00] <MikeEldora-P3> today have been having lots of display problems. 3 times have had hskp interrupts go wacky and loose display to just spoky junk. stop/start of scan seems to fix. 
[GMT 08/27/05 15:54:00] <MikeDaniels-home> no quotes, either
[GMT 08/27/05 15:55:05] <MikeDaniels-home> 04This text is in red 00This is in white
[GMT 08/27/05 15:55:17] <MikeEldora-P3> we will recover to tampa today. we left pax at 0918. good guess is a 9-10 hr flt.
[GMT 08/27/05 15:55:25] <MikeDaniels-home> You can use different % C xx values for different colors
[GMT 08/27/05 15:55:27] <ericloew-tampa> Mike S.; When this happens scroll up in the processor windows and see if either processor is out of sync.
[GMT 08/27/05 15:57:19] <ericloew-tampa> Also. Do we have a proposed takeoff time for tomorrow yet? 
[GMT 08/27/05 15:58:01] <MikeEldora-P3> last time it was the aft proc that started it. after 20-30 aft inter. missed it goes to "got extra interrupt" continuously
[GMT 08/27/05 15:58:58] <MikeEldora-P3> %C04 Mike D. thanks for info
[GMT 08/27/05 15:59:33] <MikeEldora-P3> did not work!!
[GMT 08/27/05 16:00:06] <ericloew-tampa> If the processor loses sync, it won't recover. A stop/start is all you can do to fix it right now. If you log the problem, we can collect statistics.
[GMT 08/27/05 16:00:46] <MikeEldora-P3> eric, several times today i have stopped and restarted the scan to take out the ground tilt.
[GMT 08/27/05 16:01:06] <MikeDaniels-home> ooh, must be a Mac only command (sorry)
[GMT 08/27/05 16:01:15] <ericloew-tampa> Mike 
[GMT 08/27/05 16:01:17] <MikeDaniels-home> do you have colors anywhere on your chat client?
[GMT 08/27/05 16:02:44] <ericloew-tampa> Mike S.: you can check for missed interrupts in the housekeeper window. I found these correlated with the "tilt".
[GMT 08/27/05 16:03:02] <MikeEldora-P3> also with the interrupt problem. i have noticed the display drawing a vertical line, one color about one pixel wide and usually in the fore display, occuring prior to spoke problem. might be related, will monitor.
[GMT 08/27/05 16:04:03] <ericloew-tampa> o.k. It sounds like we should probably try re-seating all the 9U boards in both processors when time is available.
[GMT 08/27/05 16:04:18] <MikeEldora-P3> mike d. got to go, getting too busy to mess with colors.

[GMT 08/27/05 16:05:56] <MikeEldora-P3> have had two fore interrupts since last start. display is now showing alot of tilt. 
[GMT 08/27/05 16:07:06] <MikeEldora-P3> no tilt in aft.
[GMT 08/27/05 16:08:06] <MikeEldora-P3> maybe a little in aft, not a much as fore. no missed aft interrupts yet.
[GMT 08/27/05 16:08:23] <ericloew-tampa> Mike S.: you just confirmed the hypothesis. We need to stop missing interrupts. Perhaps another header will be more stable?
[GMT 08/27/05 16:09:23] <MikeEldora-P3> we are on station now. might be switching soon.
[GMT 08/27/05 16:10:32] <ericloew-tampa> Probable should check w/Wen-chau first.
[GMT 08/27/05 16:11:37] <MikeEldora-P3> have been running rnx_conv all flt.
[GMT 08/27/05 16:12:51] <ericloew-tampa> rnx_conv is less demanding than conv2 on the S.P.'s
[GMT 08/27/05 16:13:34] <MikeEldora-P3> will keep that in mind if we have problems with conv2
[GMT 08/27/05 16:14:40] <MikeEldora-P3> we are near the dry tortuga islands. smooth flying so far.

[GMT 08/27/05 16:16:11] <ericloew-tampa> I'll inform Kyle; Do we have a time yet???
[GMT 08/27/05 16:18:32] <ericloew-tampa> Mike S: if missed interrupts get really bad, can try re-seating fore DP's -- 2nd and 3rd cards from RHS.

[GMT 08/27/05 19:01:34] <ericloew-tampa> i'm here
[GMT 08/27/05 19:02:33] <EldoraOp-P3> we have had some of the same display problems. fore reflect background has chnaged and self corrected a few times.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:03:20] <science2-nrlp3> Bell:
[GMT 08/27/05 19:03:46] <EldoraOp-P3> at 18:16 we restarted scan because velocity was all whacked. it had slowly degraded, as well as reflect.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:04:13] <ericloew-tampa> Any ideas as to why?
[GMT 08/27/05 19:04:31] <EldoraOp-P3> it will be interesting to see if it is in the display or data. hopefully just in display
[GMT 08/27/05 19:04:46] <science2-nrlp3> Bell, can you contact either Mike D or Janet regarding the permission to write to RAF disk? Tim cannot put dropsonde skewT plot into the Web directory.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:04:57] <MichaelBell-tampa> okay
[GMT 08/27/05 19:05:44] <EldoraOp-P3> what was confusing was background noise looked OK in both reflect and vel.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:05:56] <ericloew-tampa> At this point, I'd trust the display as being correct.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:06:26] <EldoraOp-P3> just the data part was bad.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:06:53] <ericloew-tampa> I need to look at the data to speculate on the cause. Was it both fore and aft?
[GMT 08/27/05 19:06:54] <EldoraOp-P3> oh please do not say that.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:07:25] <MichaelBell-tampa> mike d. will be home soon and will check out permissions
[GMT 08/27/05 19:07:27] <EldoraOp-P3> we have been running well since the early spoking problem
[GMT 08/27/05 19:08:17] <EldoraOp-P3> yes, fore and aft equally 
[GMT 08/27/05 19:09:19] <ericloew-tampa> perhaps the display got out of sequence and was displaying a different parameter from that indicated?
[GMT 08/27/05 19:10:50] <EldoraOp-P3> with our new display and etc i am thinking some it is just display. looking at the data, and soon, will tell more.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:11:46] <ericloew-tampa> Agreed.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:13:30] <MichaelBell-tampa> i am at mcdill, will check data when you land
[GMT 08/27/05 19:16:11] <science2-nrlp3> Eric, I did not catch your earlier message, the velocity data could be bad for a good hour or two before I caught it.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:16:31] <ericloew-tampa> thanks m.b. get the relevant time period from m.s.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:17:58] <ericloew-tampa> m.s. it would seem unlikely that both fore and aft velocities as well as reflectivities are bad. 
[GMT 08/27/05 19:18:08] <JimMoore-ops> Gents,  we are planning for NRL to reverse track to document outer band.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:18:37] <JimMoore-ops> DO we have confidence that the ELDORA data is good at this point??  Otherwise
[GMT 08/27/05 19:19:09] <JimMoore-ops> we maybe should save the flight hours--  Your thoughts--please
[GMT 08/27/05 19:19:43] <ericloew-tampa> Jim, I think you need a response from someone on the nrl bird.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:20:16] <science2-nrlp3> Jim:
[GMT 08/27/05 19:20:52] <science2-nrlp3> Jim, the ELDORA data look good since I reported last time at 18:20
[GMT 08/27/05 19:21:36] <JimMoore-ops> Great!! this mis an excellent case as the hurricane is changing it structure near the eye.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:22:08] <science2-nrlp3> Jim, that means the data are good just before we joined with 43.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:22:14] <JimMoore-ops> Hopefully your data helps PIs determine the dynamics
[GMT 08/27/05 19:22:50] <science2-nrlp3> Jim, any plan for NRL after this leg?
[GMT 08/27/05 19:24:24] <science2-nrlp3> Jim, the pilots are quite comfortable flying where we have been today.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:26:06] <JimMoore-ops> science2-nrlp3, WHo is science 2 Wen or Cai??
[GMT 08/27/05 19:27:35] <JimMoore-ops> Good news about the pilots comfort level.  This is quite importnat for tomorrow
[GMT 08/27/05 19:27:40] <science2-nrlp3> Jim, Wen and Cai, mostly Wen
[GMT 08/27/05 19:27:42] <JimMoore-ops> and future missions.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:28:53] <science2-nrlp3> Jim, yes, I think they are more comfortable after this mission.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:30:06] <science2-nrlp3> Jim, since I cannot use Chat on the first laptop, so I will use science 2 (ELDORA scientist) computer to communicate.

[GMT 08/27/05 19:50:11] <ericloew-tampa> what's your eta? as far as power goes, I need a bit more info about what might be wrong.

[GMT 08/27/05 19:55:51] <Wen-NRLP3> Eric, ETA is 2200, Mike can give you more details on the system message.

[GMT 08/27/05 19:57:29] <ericloew-tampa> m.s. do you think we need power after the flight?
[GMT 08/27/05 19:59:19] <EldoraOp-P3> this problem is not likely to show up on the ground. we could tx vertical but it might not be there.
[GMT 08/27/05 20:00:17] <ericloew-tampa> what problem are you referring to, specifically?
[GMT 08/27/05 20:00:22] <EldoraOp-P3> we reallly  need to look at some data at specfic times during this flt to know what is going on;
[GMT 08/27/05 20:01:28] <ericloew-tampa> So, you don't think having power after the flight will help at this point?
[GMT 08/27/05 20:02:16] <EldoraOp-P3> all of the display related stuff. velocity suddenly shifting for a couple sweeps then returning to normal. spokes have not been a real problem today.
[GMT 08/27/05 20:02:37] <EldoraOp-P3> background noise has looked good all day
[GMT 08/27/05 20:04:30] <EldoraOp-P3> power after the flt will only be good if we can get problem to happen. it happens occasionally, and without warning
[GMT 08/27/05 20:05:18] <ericloew-tampa> wen-chau and mike s., I will plan to meet the plane upon arrival and we can debrief then. I will need to leave within the next 45 minutes or so to make it. We will not require power until tomorrow a.m. Time TBD for now.
[GMT 08/27/05 20:06:04] <EldoraOp-P3> if we fly tomorrow the way it is today we will be good 95% jof the time. kyle and scientists will have to keep an eye on the display to correct if necessary
[GMT 08/27/05 20:07:05] <EldoraOp-P3> stop adn start scan seems to always fix the problem
[GMT 08/27/05 20:07:31] <ericloew-tampa> at least there's a work around.
[GMT 08/27/05 20:08:53] <EldoraOp-P3> right now i have a tilt in fore and aft with no missed interrupts showing on hskp
[GMT 08/27/05 20:10:11] <ericloew-tampa> there goes my theory, I guess.

[GMT 08/27/05 20:17:52] <Wen-NRLP3> Bell, can you email Charlie regarding the CAPPI display? The current setup limits the range of the CAPPI to ~10 km on each side of the aircraft. We need to use a number something like 40 km.

[GMT 08/27/05 20:22:37] <MikeDaniels-home> my link to the nrl p-3 is so slow that it is fairly difficult
[GMT 08/27/05 20:23:12] <MikeDaniels-home> but it appears that they are moving things to a different directory than before.  do you know anything about that?
