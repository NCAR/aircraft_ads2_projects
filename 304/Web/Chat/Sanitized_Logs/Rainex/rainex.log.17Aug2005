[08/17/05 19:12:36] <terry_43> #sed is an irc channel running on a server at AOC that john hill spent a chunk of time last week setting up. Prior to that the server we had been using for the P-3's had a limit of three users per IP address and we knew that with RAINEX we'd exceed that limit from the hangar's IP (the acft each have a seperate IP). So john set it all up and that is the primary channel that all the acft computers (data station, dropsonde, flight dir, radar, etc) use.
