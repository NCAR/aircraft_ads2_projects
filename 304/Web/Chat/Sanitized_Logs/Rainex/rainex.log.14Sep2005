[GMT 09/14/05 17:40:10] <terry-n43> pretty well Frank
[GMT 09/14/05 17:40:16] <terry-n43> ride not too bad
[GMT 09/14/05 17:40:25] <marks-hrd> Al Goldstein sent me an email telling me how to link to SED xchat server, but I can't get tit to work
[GMT 09/14/05 17:40:27] <terry-n43> working at 10K feet
[GMT 09/14/05 17:41:50] <marks-hrd> he said the channel is #sed, but it won't connect. I have the server address and port, password, etc ,but channel seems to be not working
[GMT 09/14/05 17:42:42] <terry-n43> do you have the password and such
[GMT 09/14/05 17:43:47] <terry-n43> the sed channel is secure, so you'll need the password and also have to check the boxes for accept SSL and also for accept invalid cert
[GMT 09/14/05 17:44:36] <marks-hrd> Did all of that.  Even set it up for our firewall proxy.
[GMT 09/14/05 17:44:56] <terry-n43> hmmm
[GMT 09/14/05 17:45:17] <terry-n43> is the server set to <Sanitized>
[GMT 09/14/05 17:45:22] <marks-hrd> not to worry. I will ping on Al. How is everything working?
[GMT 09/14/05 17:45:29] <terry-n43> pretty good
[GMT 09/14/05 17:45:37] <terry-n43> kind of an empty plane today

[GMT 09/14/05 17:58:15] <terry-n43> if anything it's gotten worse, so his data is pretty corrupt
[GMT 09/14/05 17:58:25] <terry-n43> his words "it's crap"
[GMT 09/14/05 17:59:03] <terry-n43> from the eternally optimistic Ed, that says a lot :)

[GMT 09/14/05 18:46:17] <terry-n43> i think it's got problems. Jimm, if you are at the hangar maybe page John Hill and see if he can look at it?
