[GMT 09/23/05 17:10:23] <Shuyi-nrl> GregStossmeister-Ops, upwind, feature on our right would be the eyewall, right?
[GMT 09/23/05 17:11:21] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Deanna-nrlp3, Shuyi-nrl Oops my mistake - you will be inside the band traveling upwind with it on your LEFT.

[GMT 09/23/05 19:01:59] <Shuyi-nrl> BobHouze-Ops, we're our downwind leg now. Multiple bands on both sides.
[GMT 09/23/05 19:02:18] <Deanna-nrlp3> :-) little sonde, i will miss you so....
[GMT 09/23/05 19:03:27] <Deanna-nrlp3> JimMoore-Ops-- Carl said that it's turning into a big bowl of oatmeal up here, I think that's one for the book
[GMT 09/23/05 19:03:38] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Shuyi-nrl you're in multiple bands because you moved outbound on your turn.

[GMT 09/23/05 19:06:49] <Deanna-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- we turned outward a bit to adjust for storm motion
[GMT 09/23/05 19:07:39] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Deanna-nrlp3, Shuyi-nrl As you head downwind towards point C we'd like you to extend past C to point D (27.6/93.1) and on to Point E (27.1/92.2) as usual follow the band if you can through these points as you move downwind.

[GMT 09/23/05 19:09:52] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Shuyi-nrl, Deanna-nrlp3 Keep the band close on the right as you move downwind ok?
[GMT 09/23/05 19:10:34] <Shuyi-nrl> GregStossmeister-Ops, just to confirm - downwind to D and continue to E (due S of the eye), right?
[GMT 09/23/05 19:10:53] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Deanna-nrlp3, Shuyi-nrl Correct.
[GMT 09/23/05 19:11:36] <Deanna-nrlp3> Jasmine-ops-- thanks!

[GMT 09/23/05 19:15:10] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-N43, did you really mean SW quadrant?
[GMT 09/23/05 19:15:26] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-N43, ok I see your correction
[GMT 09/23/05 19:15:44] <DaveJorgensen-N43> no Bob, I meant the SE quad

[GMT 09/23/05 19:22:46] <BobHouze-Ops> Deanna-nrlp3, Shuyi-nrl you may need to shift right to get back on the band
[GMT 09/23/05 19:23:13] <BobHouze-Ops> Deanna-nrlp3, Shuyi-nrl you would do that shift in the next 20 nm or so
[GMT 09/23/05 19:23:14] <Deanna-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- we have lost our band to the right, shall we follow the eyewall?

[GMT 09/23/05 19:24:35] <Deanna-nrlp3> JessicaKoury-ops-- was the 1922 image generated?
[GMT 09/23/05 19:24:56] <BobHouze-Ops> Deanna-nrlp3, Shuyi-nrl the band has a kind of bump that you are going around. when you shift right you will pick up the original band
[GMT 09/23/05 19:25:16] <Jasmine-ops> Deanna-nrlp3, yes, it was created
[GMT 09/23/05 19:25:50] <BobHouze-Ops> Deanna-nrlp3, Shuyi-nrl point E should be right on the band
[GMT 09/23/05 19:26:12] <RobRogers-NOAA43> radial location of max FL and SFMR winds in all 4 quads supports contention that inner core is experiencing SW shear

[GMT 09/23/05 19:48:12] <BobHouze-Ops> Deanna-nrlp3, the plan I described to Shuyi is to complete your circuit to the NE quadrant (point G) then reverse back to E then reverse back to G, then you will move in and circumnavigate the outer edge of the eyewall, then you will enter the ey from the S or SE and circumnavigate the inside of the eyewall and drop sondes, then you will follow Shuyi's plan to drop sondes S of the storm

[GMT 09/23/05 21:09:34] <RobRogers-NOAA43> Ops we are doing a string of HRD drops on the inner edge of this band, 5 minute spacing
[GMT 09/23/05 21:10:11] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Shuyi-nrl, Suggested entry point to eye is (Pt. I: 28.0/92.6) This would bring you in the south side where eyewall is open then circumnavigate downwind inside the eyewall ok?
[GMT 09/23/05 21:10:19] <Jasmine-ops> Deanna--did you get this one from bob"if it's ok by you, i named 28.4, 92.1 as point H"
[GMT 09/23/05 21:11:14] <Shuyi-nrl> GregStossmeister-Ops, agreed, that's a good plan. copy point I.
[GMT 09/23/05 21:11:28] <Jasmine-ops> Deanna--ignore what I gave you, use what Greg just said
[GMT 09/23/05 21:11:35] <JessicaKoury-ops> science3-nrlp3, thanks for the update on the images.
[GMT 09/23/05 21:11:38] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-N43rf, yes, I see those sw bands too. They join up with the band you are in now on the sw side of the storm. the band you are in could interpreted as a secondary band. with other features it seems to form a ring around the storm
[GMT 09/23/05 21:12:06] <science3-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops, Jasmine-ops copied all of that
[GMT 09/23/05 21:12:19] <DaveJorgensen-N43rf> BobHouze-Ops, yep I see what you're getting at
[GMT 09/23/05 21:12:19] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-N43rf, correction: secondary band = secondary eyewall (big one)
[GMT 09/23/05 21:13:08] <DaveJorgensen-N43rf> BobHouze-Ops, we'll see if there is a secondary wind max when we go through it on the way back to the eye

[GMT 09/23/05 21:13:20] <DaveJorgensen-N43rf> BobHouze-Ops, then we can say if this is really a "secondary eyewall"

[GMT 09/23/05 21:14:22] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-N43rf, I'm only guessing maybe that it is trying to be a 2ndary eyewall. nothing near as clear as yesterday

[GMT 09/23/05 21:15:43] <RobRogers-NOAA43> dave -- I think shear probably played a significant role
[GMT 09/23/05 21:16:06] <RobRogers-NOAA43> perhaps dry air intruding from the west side; shear makes vortex more susceptible to that
[GMT 09/23/05 21:16:26] <DaveJorgensen-N43rf> BobHouze-Ops, yep, the all purpose explaination, changes in environmental shear
[GMT 09/23/05 21:16:56] <DaveJorgensen-N43rf> Rob, any dropsonde evidence to support dry air intrusion from the west?

[GMT 09/23/05 21:20:10] <DaveJorgensen-N43rf> BobHouze-Ops, not much of a wind max going though that band N of the center
[GMT 09/23/05 21:20:13] <BobHouze-Ops> Deanna-nrlp3, what do you want AFTER you EXIT the eye, after your interior work
[GMT 09/23/05 21:20:17] <Shuyi-nrl> BobHouze-Ops, then going through one and a half circle. We can get out from the S.
[GMT 09/23/05 21:20:35] <Deanna-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- we're open to suggestions
[GMT 09/23/05 21:21:13] <Deanna-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- we'll probably need to go home after we exit the eye
[GMT 09/23/05 21:21:30] <Shuyi-nrl> BobHouze-Ops, we're calc time, standby.
[GMT 09/23/05 21:21:35] <BobHouze-Ops> deanna come out to south and circum navigate downwind on the outside of the eyewall to a point north of storm center
[GMT 09/23/05 21:22:21] <DaveJorgensen-N43rf> BobHouze-Ops, we on N43 have a suggestion for NRL, exit the eye to the S and pick up band near 27.5N then proceed SW along band, reverse after 60 nm or so

[GMT 09/23/05 21:27:19] <Shuyi-nrl> BobHouze-Ops, we estimate that exit the eye at the S side at about 22:15. We only have 45 min left before leaving the storm.
[GMT 09/23/05 21:27:36] <BobHouze-Ops> Deanna-nrlp3, Shuyi-nrl after you exit eye go west to point J 28.2/93.4  then downwind to point K to 27.4/92.8

[GMT 09/23/05 22:17:07] <DaveJorgensen-N43rf> not sure about how strong it is to the N, just too far away to see well from here

[GMT 09/23/05 22:18:19] <JimMoore-Ops> DaveJorgensen-N43rf, OK thanks, better youll get  a better look as you head through
[GMT 09/23/05 22:18:40] <Shuyi-nrl> BobHouze-Ops, it's bumpy.
[GMT 09/23/05 22:18:54] <JimMoore-Ops> DaveJorgensen-N43rf, NRL will be about 30 minutes behind you
[GMT 09/23/05 22:18:55] <DaveJorgensen-N43rf> BobHouze-Ops, OK
[GMT 09/23/05 22:19:16] <BradSmull-N43> Ditto that observation Shuyi!  We've had some moderately rough eyewall crossings today, particularly on N & NW sides
[GMT 09/23/05 22:19:20] <mblack> increadible tilted high reflectivity along the band
[GMT 09/23/05 22:19:51] <Shuyi-nrl> BobHouze-Ops, 42 left, are we getting LF coverage from 43 from now on or 88D to get us out?
[GMT 09/23/05 22:20:05] <DaveJorgensen-N43rf> BobHouze-Ops, OK we're now tracking N between that band I described thats maybe 40 nm to our east and the secondary eyewall that is perhaps 40 nm to our west
[GMT 09/23/05 22:20:27] <JimMoore-Ops> Shuyi-nrl, Yes we are SHuyi--got in good shape
[GMT 09/23/05 22:20:40] <BradSmull-N43> Ops - hopefully you're getting good LF mapping from us of intense N-S band east of storm center. This feature will be key facator in NRL's exit
[GMT 09/23/05 22:20:44] <DaveJorgensen-N43rf> BobHouze-Ops, scratch those last measurements, bands are maybe 30 nm on our east and west
[GMT 09/23/05 22:20:45] <BobHouze-Ops> Shuyi-nrl, i am using 88D primarily
[GMT 09/23/05 22:20:52] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Deanna-nrlp3, Shuyi-nrl After you reach Point P continue downwind to one more point (Point R: 28.0/92.4) then exit to the SE. 
[GMT 09/23/05 22:21:01] <Shuyi-nrl> Thx, Jim.
[GMT 09/23/05 22:21:04] <BobHouze-Ops> Shuyi-nrl, you are right on edge of 88D echo
[GMT 09/23/05 22:21:41] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-N43rf, can you tuck into that band?
[GMT 09/23/05 22:21:55] <Shuyi-nrl> BobHouze-Ops, copy point R. 
[GMT 09/23/05 22:22:15] <Deanna-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- copy pt. R, exit SE after reaching
[GMT 09/23/05 22:22:53] <Shuyi-nrl> BobHouze-Ops, ok, will exit in SE.
[GMT 09/23/05 22:23:02] <DaveJorgensen-N43rf> BobHouze-Ops, nope we already asked and we're short on endurance and we need to get in position for 00Z fix

[GMT 09/23/05 22:29:13] <BobHouze-Ops> Deanna-nrlp3, Shuyi-nrl there are convective bands at 91W and at 92W. you will have to pick your way between cells. Both bands look pretty convective.
[GMT 09/23/05 22:29:19] <JimMoore-Ops> DaveJorgensen-N43rf, 88D suggests alot more convective to the NE as things crank up near shore
[GMT 09/23/05 22:29:47] <Shuyi-nrl> BobHouze-Ops, we're goint to point R now. We will find a gap in the band to the E, then go home.
[GMT 09/23/05 22:29:48] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-N43rf, yes 88D shows a lot of strong cells just ahead of you
[GMT 09/23/05 22:30:10] <BobHouze-Ops> Shuyi-nrl, exit to SE as greg indicated
[GMT 09/23/05 22:30:12] <Deanna-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- copy that, see shuyi's chat

[GMT 09/23/05 22:31:15] <DaveJorgensen-N43rf> JimMoore-Ops, we see that Bob & Jim, but there is a break in the band maybe 10-15 nm before those cells to the N

[GMT 09/23/05 22:32:00] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-N43rf,  we are sending NRL out to the SE with instructions to find gaps between cells
[GMT 09/23/05 22:32:08] <JimMoore-Ops> DaveJorgensen-N43rf, Gotcha--
[GMT 09/23/05 22:32:38] <DaveJorgensen-N43rf> JimMoore-Ops, good idea about NRL
[GMT 09/23/05 22:34:12] <Deanna-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- copy your message
[GMT 09/23/05 22:34:38] <BobHouze-Ops> Deanna-nrlp3, will you be turning soon?
[GMT 09/23/05 22:36:28] <JimMoore-Ops> Deanna-nrlp3, The band at 91 is stronger thatn the one you are deviating around now
[GMT 09/23/05 22:36:35] <Deanna-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- shuyi's answering your question
[GMT 09/23/05 22:36:40] <BobHouze-Ops> Deanna-nrlp3, convection gets more intense to the north
[GMT 09/23/05 22:37:27] <Shuyi-nrl> BobHouze-Ops, once we pass the band at 91.8 W, then we may go S if there is no easy way out throught the next band.
