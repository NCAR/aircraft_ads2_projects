[GMT 09/09/05 12:01:14] <BradSmull-n43rf> Understood. Note that it is far from linear--line of broken, intense cells. They will need to be careful.

[GMT 09/09/05 12:03:17] <BradSmull-n43rf> I think there's going to be plenty of vorticity Roger--except that it's maximized on the convective scale  ;-)
[GMT 09/09/05 12:03:59] <n43-rogers> yeah that's true Bob, so that can wait for after a later fix I suppose

[GMT 09/09/05 12:06:42] <BradSmull-n43rf> Bob, at this point my recommendation would be to keep NRL on the far northern band.
[GMT 09/09/05 12:07:03] <BradSmull-n43rf> Inner band is apparently at radius of max winds, as determined by SFMR
[GMT 09/09/05 12:07:39] <n43-rogers> we're going to try to fly just outside this upcoming rainband for the downwind leg, at least for a portion of the downwind leg, to get tail coverage of it on this leg
[GMT 09/09/05 12:08:52] <BradSmull-n43rf> Minimum pressure of 985 mb measured by sonde occured with winds of 21 kt.... wow

[GMT 09/09/05 12:09:55] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Brad: That's rather a surprise.
[GMT 09/09/05 12:10:11] <BradSmull-n43rf> Indeed.
[GMT 09/09/05 12:10:37] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Brad: We are happy if your downwind leg covers some of this outer band - should give us several looks at it.
[GMT 09/09/05 12:10:54] <BobHouze-Ops> rob: that will be great to go along that band
[GMT 09/09/05 12:11:04] <BobHouze-Ops> maybe we'll catch it again with NRL

[GMT 09/09/05 12:37:54] <rogers-n43> no problem greg
[GMT 09/09/05 12:38:27] <rogers-n43> i figured by sending us along this band we could see how it looked now, if we end up flying it later today we have a sense of temporal evolution

[GMT 09/09/05 15:22:21] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NOAA43, we want both aircraft to keep working their current tracks, reversing at end  points. We may update endpoints
[GMT 09/09/05 15:22:31] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Understood. 
[GMT 09/09/05 15:23:00] <Melicie-NRLP3> NRL just did drop 11
[GMT 09/09/05 15:23:11] <N43-Sta2> do you think we have been flying an eyewall forming in this sheared system on the downwind side?

[GMT 09/09/05 15:23:19] <N43-Sta2> or is that happening radially inward of us?
[GMT 09/09/05 15:23:59] <N43-Sta2> from the lf it looks like the only game around is this feature we're flying

[GMT 09/09/05 15:26:34] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Ops: Just to confirm, we should reverse track when we rach 30.4 N (i.e. the latitude of the original northern-most point)

[GMT 09/09/05 15:41:19] <science2-nrlp3> we are trying to get in sync with 43
[GMT 09/09/05 15:41:57] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Ops: N43 is resuming equispaced drops on this southbound track
[GMT 09/09/05 15:42:11] <BobHouze-Ops> exact synchronization is not necessary
[GMT 09/09/05 15:42:32] <BradSmull-NOAA43> NRL: Timing coordination is not critical on our tracks (tho when Dave Jorgensen gets here it may be moreso, owing to his quad-Doppler interetss)
[GMT 09/09/05 15:43:03] <BradSmull-NOAA43> This band has a sharp turn ("elbow") near 30 deg N
[GMT 09/09/05 15:46:15] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NOAA43, the 88D shows a nicely curved band
[GMT 09/09/05 15:46:54] <BobHouze-Ops> Melicie-NRLP3, when you get to last way point, reverse track

[GMT 09/09/05 15:47:30] <BobHouze-Ops> Melicie-NRLP3, when you get to last way point, reverse track
[GMT 09/09/05 15:47:33] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Ops - we can continue to do these tracks for awhile... trying to get a cutoff time for N43's involvement
[GMT 09/09/05 15:47:55] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NOAA43, this is a good pattern to keep repeating
[GMT 09/09/05 15:47:59] <Melicie-NRLP3> ok bob
[GMT 09/09/05 15:48:41] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Ops -Upon getting to south end of band and reversing to north, that will be the end of N43's involvement until after we complete our 18Z fix for NHC
[GMT 09/09/05 15:48:44] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NOAA43, regarding synching tracks. if we do it we need to accoutn for the different radius of curvature of the two tracks

[GMT 09/09/05 15:49:37] <BradSmull-NOAA43> That's why I suggest (and I believe you agree) that synchronization is not critical or perhaps even advisable
[GMT 09/09/05 15:49:48] <BradSmull-NOAA43> BTW, drops have been highly successful today on N43
[GMT 09/09/05 15:49:50] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NOAA43, understand you will reverse track and then go back to tasking
[GMT 09/09/05 15:50:26] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Bob: That is correct
[GMT 09/09/05 15:50:59] <BobHouze-Ops> Melicie-NRLP3, you are flying between a bigger band to yuour right and an inner band to your left
[GMT 09/09/05 15:51:46] <Melicie-NRLP3> bob ok

[GMT 09/09/05 16:31:30] <science2-nrlp3> how about reverse track
[GMT 09/09/05 16:32:03] <Melicie-NRLP3> yes outside track would be better
[GMT 09/09/05 16:32:38] <science2-nrlp3> NRL will orbit until further instructions
[GMT 09/09/05 16:32:50] <BobHouze-Ops> NRL new points: 30.7/79.1--30.8/79.7--30.4/79.9

[GMT 09/09/05 16:34:02] <BradSmull-NOAA43> So we would be available for some continued work on the W/NW side of the storm
[GMT 09/09/05 16:34:06] <BobHouze-Ops> Melicie-NRLP3, let me know how that goes

[GMT 09/09/05 17:26:16] <BradSmull-n43> Ops -FD says there's "no way" we can cross over, and I agree. This is an eyewall we're flying adjacent to, not a rainband.

[GMT 09/09/05 17:27:34] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-n43, rogers-n43 can we get rainex sondes on these passes? 5 min intervals?
[GMT 09/09/05 17:27:43] <BradSmull-n43> Us to NRL--unfortunately we're probably ~duplicating your obs at present because we couldn't get onto the N/NE side of the "band"

[GMT 09/09/05 17:40:24] <rogers-n43> on lf can see classic principal rainband, which you're proposing we fly on the inside of 
[GMT 09/09/05 17:40:55] <Jasmine-ops> terry--no 1 Hz received since 1739
[GMT 09/09/05 17:41:00] <rogers-n43> can see eyewall on the SW side, so what I think you're proposing would bring us on the inside of that principal band
[GMT 09/09/05 17:41:06] <BobHouze-Ops> Melicie-NRLP3, we'd like NRL to reverse track again once you get to the end point
