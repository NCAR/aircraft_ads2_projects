[GMT 09/19/05 18:06:21] <GregStossmeister-Ops> ChrisBurghart-Boulder, Wen-Chau believes the ground station in Boulder for Iridium has failed - Can you look into it?
[GMT 09/19/05 18:06:40] <GregStossmeister-Ops> ChrisBurghart-Boulder, This is urgent we have no comms with them right now and they are in the middle of the flight plan.
[GMT 09/19/05 18:07:13] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Hi Greg.  I just got that message from Charlie Martin, and I'm looking into the problem now.
[GMT 09/19/05 18:07:27] <GregStossmeister-Ops> ChrisBurghart-Boulder, Thanks Chris.
[GMT 09/19/05 18:13:53] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> pavel-jeffco, are you there?
[GMT 09/19/05 18:38:15] <GregStossmeister-Ops> ChrisBurghart-Boulder, Any progress on Iridium?
[GMT 09/19/05 18:39:52] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Not yet.  Since I haven't spoken to anyone on NRL-P3 directly, can you describe the problem as you know it?
[GMT 09/19/05 18:40:47] <GregStossmeister-Ops> ChrisBurghart-Boulder, We have been out of communication for nearly an hour. We have talked to them via sat-phone suggest you do the same.
[GMT 09/19/05 18:41:10] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Can you give me their #?
[GMT 09/19/05 18:41:14] <GregStossmeister-Ops> ChrisBurghart-Boulder, Wen-Chau said they rebooted on-board system to no avail.
[GMT 09/19/05 18:41:50] <GregStossmeister-Ops> ChrisBurghart-Boulder, 866-508-5608

[GMT 09/19/05 18:49:01] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> GregStossmeister-Ops: Kurt Zrubek and I have both called SCD, since it looks like the issue is between the NRL-P3 and there (since SCD/RAS is serving as the ISP, and the P3 isn't even getting as far as having a connection to the net).
[GMT 09/19/05 18:49:22] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> We're waiting for more from them.
[GMT 09/19/05 18:51:23] <GregStossmeister-Ops> ChrisBurghart-Boulder, Anything you can do would be much appreciated. Flight coordination very difficult in this mode and comms down for 1.8 hrs now (I underestimated earlier).

[GMT 09/19/05 19:04:50] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Hi Pavel.   I was wondering if you knew specifics of NRL's connection difficulties, but I ended up calling Wen Chau on the plane.
[GMT 09/19/05 19:05:03] <pavel-jeffco> Ok, I had no idea anyway
[GMT 09/19/05 19:05:21] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Hi, Chris, Jim let me know something was up
[GMT 09/19/05 19:05:27] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Who in NETS did you talk to?
[GMT 09/19/05 19:06:01] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> I just called 1200, and the operators already had a ticket started based on a call from Kurt Zrubek a few minutes earlier.
[GMT 09/19/05 19:07:12] <MarkBradford-Boulder> And from the discussion I saw on Jim's screen, they're not even getting as far as the RAS?
[GMT 09/19/05 19:09:00] <MarkBradford-Boulder> If we don't hear back from NETS soon, we can start working our way up the chain

[GMT 09/19/05 19:11:22] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Hi again Chris
[GMT 09/19/05 19:12:58] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder_> Sorry, Mark.  I just inadvertenly shut down my xchat.  Anyway, I got into this quite late, so saw none of the earlier discussion of the problem.  I spoke very briefly with Wen-Chau, and it sounds like they are not getting connected to the RAS.  I have seen a couple of data points show up for them at Miami (implying they have connected briefly), but have not seen equivalent points in Boulder (which relays the data to Miami).  Weird.
[GMT 09/19/05 19:13:24] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Yes, that's pretty odd.  Are you in your office?
[GMT 09/19/05 19:13:31] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder_> Yes.
[GMT 09/19/05 19:13:42] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Let me call, it'll be quicker

[GMT 09/19/05 19:19:31] <anstett-ct> Hi Chris
[GMT 09/19/05 19:19:46] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder_> Have you heard about the NRL-P3 connection issues?
[GMT 09/19/05 19:20:06] <anstett-ct> I heard that the phone won't connect.
[GMT 09/19/05 19:20:28] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder_> That's my understanding, with very little in the way of specifics.
[GMT 09/19/05 19:21:39] <anstett-ct> I can't really troubleshoot from here until I can talk to someone on the plane when they are in front of the computer.  I asked Kurt to call SCD and see if there are problems with RAS.
[GMT 09/19/05 19:22:00] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder_> Are there any intermediate steps in the communication between the plane and RAS?  I'm wondering if there's any potential Iridium-specific problem that we should be looking into.
[GMT 09/19/05 19:22:48] <MarkBradford-Boulder> I gave Chris a few names of NETS people to try if we don't get a prompt resolution
[GMT 09/19/05 19:23:11] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder_> Janet, you can call Wen-Chau on the plane at 866-508-5608.  It's toll-free (from your side, at least :-)

[GMT 09/19/05 20:24:19] <ads-nrlp3> Pavel, all should note that the satcom phone #s (data vs voice) have changed again back to original. I hesitated swapping them, for that reason,  and I shouldn't have.
