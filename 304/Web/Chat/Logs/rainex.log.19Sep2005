[GMT 09/19/05 17:56:09] <mblack-n43> Yes- NW is convective and appears more than the SW-although we haven't passed thru SW yet
[GMT 09/19/05 17:57:18] <mblack-n43> This principle band appears to be wrapping around to ctr from SW all the way around to east side
[GMT 09/19/05 17:57:49] <mblack-n43> I would not be surpised to see this band break off and form eyewall later
[GMT 09/19/05 17:59:17] <mblack-n43> I think north-NW would be ideal area for coordination

[GMT 09/19/05 18:55:27] <mblack-n43> They were- but if they loitered they would be way behind for coordination at NE- now what area should we work?

[GMT 09/19/05 18:59:00] <mblack-n43> Yes- I think N43 could work the band on the outside-flying downwind while NRL is inside-all the way around to the west or even SW

[GMT 09/19/05 19:33:13] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- we are in the upwind leg, what is the dropsonde interval?
[GMT 09/19/05 19:33:48] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, 12 minutes
[GMT 09/19/05 19:34:18] <mblack-n43> just turned to west bewtween bands

[GMT 09/19/05 19:34:59] <JessicaKoury-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, do you want those images small again?
[GMT 09/19/05 19:35:12] <BobHouze-Ops> mblack-n43, or outside, either way seems reasonable
[GMT 09/19/05 19:35:17] <Jasmine-nrlp3> StacyBrodzik-Ops-- we just received 1932, so images appear to be coming up fine
[GMT 09/19/05 19:35:46] <Jasmine-nrlp3> JessicaKoury-Ops-- which small images?  Flight track?
[GMT 09/19/05 19:36:04] <JessicaKoury-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, oops, nevermind!  I thought you were talking about different images.
[GMT 09/19/05 19:36:57] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- once we reach the last point you gave us (23.9/75.8) we may have to head home to Tampa.  Any challenging weather between there and Tampa?
[GMT 09/19/05 19:37:04] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, Jasmine-nrlp3 Be advised that islands are showing up in the images. Carl should be aware of what is echo and what is island. Stacy maybe able to make the islands show up better
[GMT 09/19/05 19:38:31] <BradSmull-nrl> understood Bob--advising Carl now. Still awaiting first ldm image here
[GMT 09/19/05 19:39:26] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- ShuyiChen-opc, do you have an answer about the dropsonde interval considering we are in an upwind leg?
[GMT 09/19/05 19:39:57] <ShuyiChen-opc> NRL: upwind drops every 12 min.
[GMT 09/19/05 19:40:18] <Jasmine-nrlp3> ShuyiChen-opc-- ok, thanks.

[GMT 09/19/05 19:41:55] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, any reason for wanting to leave early?
[GMT 09/19/05 19:42:42] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, further explanation: we were going to bring you all the way around the upwind circle to exit on the S side.

[GMT 09/19/05 19:45:27] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, Jasmine-nrlp3 Stacy has fixed the images to show the islands. They will appear on future images
[GMT 09/19/05 19:45:36] <terry_n43> yeah, I know.. 587 shows up and then we have satcom issues
[GMT 09/19/05 19:45:49] <BradSmull-nrl> BobHouze-Ops,  We are computing time required for long upwind leg--may be possible
[GMT 09/19/05 19:45:57] <terry_n43> I git one 'net back up (xchat & 1 Hz) and am working on the other
[GMT 09/19/05 19:46:04] <Jasmine-nrlp3> StacyBrodzik-Ops-- BobHouze-Ops-- thanks, we'll let you know how the new images look
[GMT 09/19/05 19:46:19] <JessicaKoury-Ops> terry_n43, okay, thanks for trying, I'll let you know when the LF data is running again
[GMT 09/19/05 19:46:34] <JessicaKoury-Ops> terry_n43, got it!  thank you!
[GMT 09/19/05 19:46:47] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, as an alternative, could reverse track from your norht point and go back around downwind. that might help. then exit S side.
[GMT 09/19/05 19:46:50] <terry_n43> yeah!
[GMT 09/19/05 19:47:22] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- we agree, that might be the better idea
[GMT 09/19/05 19:49:09] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- we'll probably be turning and working a downwind leg on the southside of the rainband
[GMT 09/19/05 19:50:31] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, clarify. do you mean with the rainband on your right?
[GMT 09/19/05 19:51:25] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- no, it will be on our left.
[GMT 09/19/05 19:52:33] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, why are you not going to outside? And whay are you not going to the norht pont?

[GMT 09/19/05 20:00:15] <BobHouze-Ops> mblack-n43, when you get to 24 N can you turn back in toward the center and then go upwind with band on your left.
[GMT 09/19/05 20:00:54] <BobHouze-Ops> mblack-n43, the reason is that NRL turned out at 24 and are now going downwind on the outside of the band.
[GMT 09/19/05 20:01:12] <mblack-n43> after N43 reaches our SW point-willl track through eye to north then to MacDill
[GMT 09/19/05 20:01:59] <mblack-n43> Passing by impressive line of cells to our left in NW quad
[GMT 09/19/05 20:02:51] <Jasmine-nrlp3> ShuyiChen-opc-- Just wanted to confirm that we have been dropping every 12 on this upwind leg.  Do you want to return to 7 min drops or continue every 12 min now that we are going downwind?
[GMT 09/19/05 20:03:16] <BobHouze-Ops> mblack-n43, no need to go to far SW since NRL is going there. It would be better to turn into the center at 24, back to center, then NW to McDill
[GMT 09/19/05 20:03:21] <ShuyiChen-opc> Jasmine: good, 7 min is fine.
[GMT 09/19/05 20:03:24] <Melicie-Ops> mblack-n43, and Jasmine-nrlp3  what are your flight level winds ?
[GMT 09/19/05 20:04:11] <mblack-n43> 45 kts flt-lev; -12-14 km echo tops   on tail radar
[GMT 09/19/05 20:05:22] <pchang_n43> arent you seeing flt level winds from n43 as part of the 1hz data stream??
[GMT 09/19/05 20:05:41] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Melicie-Ops-- 12 kft, with 36 kt winds

[GMT 09/19/05 20:08:37] <ShuyiChen-opc> Jasmine: drop the last sonde at your east-most point at 76W, no more sondes after that.
[GMT 09/19/05 20:08:42] <Jasmine-nrlp3> ShuyiChen-opc-- copy your dropsonde message, we'll drop every 7 min
[GMT 09/19/05 20:09:12] <mblack-n43> Hitting moderate to heavy turbulence on WNW side
[GMT 09/19/05 20:09:40] <Jasmine-nrlp3> ShuyiChen-opc-- ok, now more drops after east-most point
[GMT 09/19/05 20:10:09] <ShuyiChen-opc> mblack: there are some new cells in the N-NW-W bands on vis.

[GMT 09/19/05 20:11:49] <ShuyiChen-opc> OK thx, jasmine.
[GMT 09/19/05 20:12:03] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, yes the band pretty much ends there
[GMT 09/19/05 20:12:35] <BradSmull-nrl> We are turning to track 90 and have had strong feature to our left, but intensityappears to drop off ahead (to our east)
[GMT 09/19/05 20:12:52] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, that is correct
[GMT 09/19/05 20:14:30] <mblack-n43> flying thru huge are of stratiform now with some imbedded convection
[GMT 09/19/05 20:14:36] <BradSmull-nrl> OK - then should we reverse track or again switch to N side of band?
[GMT 09/19/05 20:14:36] <BradSmull-nrl> LF looks very messy to us on N side...
[GMT 09/19/05 20:14:49] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, we recommend reversing at your easten point and heading west then NW to go back to TPA 
[GMT 09/19/05 20:15:40] <BradSmull-nrl> OK  --eastern most point for NRL is 76 W, correct?
[GMT 09/19/05 20:15:52] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, affirmative
[GMT 09/19/05 20:16:09] <BradSmull-nrl> Thanks Bob!
[GMT 09/19/05 20:16:29] <BobHouze-Ops> mblack-n43, what's your plan from here?
[GMT 09/19/05 20:18:05] <mblack-n43> we are working our way around the band to point due south of ctr-
[GMT 09/19/05 20:18:34] <mblack-n43> then w'ell track due north thru ctr and exit to the NW for MacDill
[GMT 09/19/05 20:19:24] <ShuyiChen-opc> mblack: that's good, give us another ctr fix.
[GMT 09/19/05 20:19:49] <BobHouze-Ops> mblack-n43, when you are back in the NW quadrant, can you do a short leg parallel to one of the bands in that sector?
[GMT 09/19/05 20:21:04] <BobHouze-Ops> mblack-n43, specifically on the inside of one of those bands. NRL never got up there on their inside track
[GMT 09/19/05 20:22:48] <mblack-n43> Probably-we'll check on our time when we get near ctr- any particular band? there are several in that sector-we flew between bands last time
[GMT 09/19/05 20:23:54] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- we're turning to reverse track now.  We will NOT drop any more sondes here on out.
[GMT 09/19/05 20:24:24] <Deanna-ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, copy that...if possible, keep the echoes close on your right side
[GMT 09/19/05 20:24:30] <ShuyiChen-opc> mblack: how many RAINEX sondes have you dropped? Any left?
[GMT 09/19/05 20:25:10] <BobHouze-Ops> mblack-n43, I see two or 3 good bands with inside edges at about 24.5/76.5
[GMT 09/19/05 20:25:17] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Deanna-ops-- ok, will do
[GMT 09/19/05 20:28:38] <Deanna-ops> mblack-n43, do you have a current storm center?
[GMT 09/19/05 20:29:43] <mblack-n43> Bob: we'll be out of the rain in 12-14minutes-we can track thru eye then noorthbound to work a saml section of a band on N or NNW side

[GMT 09/19/05 20:51:22] <terry_n43> wasn't a huge effort.... ummmm, it was an inside job shall we say. The <insider> now owes me mass quantities of Guinness
[GMT 09/19/05 20:52:00] <mblack> The center is at 23.1 N, 76.37W- we are there nnow at 2052UTC
[GMT 09/19/05 20:52:21] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, BradSmull-nrl we are confused by your track

[GMT 09/19/05 20:53:33] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- things are changing on us pretty quickly
[GMT 09/19/05 20:54:17] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, we see that in latest image.It clears out quickly to your west

[GMT 09/19/05 20:55:30] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- we got the image. We've been following a band feature, but deviating around a convective feature.
[GMT 09/19/05 20:55:56] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- LF doesn't really seem to capture some of the features we're flying through
[GMT 09/19/05 20:56:09] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, Jasmine-nrlp3 when you get a few miles west  i think you'll be out of the cells
[GMT 09/19/05 20:56:36] <BradSmull-nrl> Bob--this side of storm is evoving rapidly. Basically, we need to get out.
[GMT 09/19/05 20:56:44] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- Ok, thanks
[GMT 09/19/05 20:56:47] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, agreed
[GMT 09/19/05 20:56:58] <BradSmull-nrl> Bob--thanks, we are tracking west
[GMT 09/19/05 20:57:01] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-nrl,  you should be in good shape quickly
[GMT 09/19/05 20:57:24] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- we're basically in stratiform now, thanks
[GMT 09/19/05 20:57:48] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, understood. Might as well head back to TPA
[GMT 09/19/05 20:58:13] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- ok, copy that
[GMT 09/19/05 20:59:09] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, Jasmine-nrlp3 Those active cells are about 60 mi west of the storm center
[GMT 09/19/05 21:00:01] <BradSmull-nrl> Yes Bob--gaps were closing up VERY quickly

[GMT 09/19/05 21:10:03] <BradSmull-nrl> Greg--actually that question should have been directed to you
[GMT 09/19/05 21:10:07] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- we're looking at approx 2 hours from now, so 7:10, give or take
[GMT 09/19/05 21:10:35] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, loose convective bands oriented NE-SW that look pretty broken from Miami 88d
[GMT 09/19/05 21:10:41] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- or 2310, depending on which clock you're looking at!
[GMT 09/19/05 21:10:42] <terry-n43> I had to kick the radar a bit ago, is data coming through OK?
[GMT 09/19/05 21:10:59] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, Thanks Jasmine
[GMT 09/19/05 21:11:09] <JessicaKoury-Ops> terry-n43, yep, LF is coming in fine
[GMT 09/19/05 21:11:42] <terry-n43> JessicaKoury-Ops, cool!
[GMT 09/19/05 21:12:12] <mblack-n43> thin band we just crossed thru had a good kick toit!
[GMT 09/19/05 21:12:27] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, Miami radar is down at the moment and data is rather old here.
[GMT 09/19/05 21:13:02] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, Last image was at 305pm from Miami 88D
[GMT 09/19/05 21:13:33] <BradSmull-nrl> Satellite?
[GMT 09/19/05 21:14:15] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, Satellite is misleading - not as much echo as clouds have suggested today - standby.
[GMT 09/19/05 21:16:30] <mblack-n43> Working downwind along band(s) now -will end in 10 minutes with drop in the band
[GMT 09/19/05 21:17:18] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, Your current heading looks good - you may have to dodge some widely spaced convective towers, not much convection north of 27N w exception of some storms SW of Melbourne over land.
[GMT 09/19/05 21:19:33] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, Melbourne 88D not showing much north of Ft. Pierce right now
[GMT 09/19/05 21:20:58] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- thanks for the weather update.  Will pass along to the flight deck
