[GMT 09/22/05 14:40:05] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Ops - wind sharply increasing now 100 knots
[GMT 09/22/05 14:40:45] <JimMoore-Ops> RobRogers-NOAA43, Good morning Rob, What are the plans for supplemental rainex drops on 43?
[GMT 09/22/05 14:41:27] <RobRogers-NOAA43> hi jim, standby may be making one now in this outer eyewall about 30 nm from center....
[GMT 09/22/05 14:41:40] <mblack-aoc> The G_IV just reported that there is a lot of dry air ahead of Rita- to the W and NW
[GMT 09/22/05 14:41:59] <mblack-aoc> Mike Bell and I headed to N42-will chat after takeoff

[GMT 09/22/05 14:43:00] <RobRogers-NOAA43> so no RAINEX drop
[GMT 09/22/05 14:43:02] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Ops - no sign of wind peak in this "outer" eyewall - I don't think this is an eyewall
[GMT 09/22/05 14:43:13] <RobRogers-NOAA43> FL winds stayed constant at 100 kt
[GMT 09/22/05 14:43:35] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Ops - this band is very stratiform with only a few embedded cells

[GMT 09/22/05 14:44:19] <GregStossmeister-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43rf, RobRogers-NOAA43 So outside this band you guys saw a gradient bringing winds up to 100 kts but now its flat across th band?
[GMT 09/22/05 14:44:30] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> yep
[GMT 09/22/05 14:44:31] <JimMoore-Ops> RobRogers-NOAA43, OK Rob, Will there be a rainex sonde in the main eyewall or is that covered in the tasking?
[GMT 09/22/05 14:44:44] <RobRogers-NOAA43> greg -- yeah it was a steady climb up to 100 kt
[GMT 09/22/05 14:44:59] <GregStossmeister-Ops> RobRogers-NOAA43, Thx Rob.
[GMT 09/22/05 14:45:06] <RobRogers-NOAA43> there will be an nhc drop at the surface wind max and a RAINEX drop at the flight-level wind max (i.e. in the center of the eyewall)
[GMT 09/22/05 14:45:34] <JimMoore-Ops> RobRogers-NOAA43, Excellent, thanks
[GMT 09/22/05 14:45:41] <RobRogers-NOAA43> now FL winds shooting up past 130 kt as we enter "real" eyewall
[GMT 09/22/05 14:46:29] <Jasmine-nrlp3> StacyBrodzik-Ops-- howdy there.  We're getting the composite images up here just fine.  And with color!  :-)
[GMT 09/22/05 14:47:03] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Ops - very smooth eyewall penetration compared to yesterday

[GMT 09/22/05 14:52:48] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, BradSmull-NRL We'd like to adjust your IP now that we've seen the bands 43s LF. Your new IP should be 25.6/88.0 
[GMT 09/22/05 14:53:27] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Ops - no secondary wind max - just a single eyewall
[GMT 09/22/05 14:53:50] <JimMoore-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, This not to be confused with the red and the blue states!!
[GMT 09/22/05 14:53:55] <BradSmull-NRL> Understood Greg
[GMT 09/22/05 14:53:57] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, BradSmull-NRL The new IP should bring you just outside the band that 43 passed before reaching the eyewall.
[GMT 09/22/05 14:54:34] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- ok, thanks for the info!!
[GMT 09/22/05 14:54:41] <Jasmine-nrlp3> JimMoore-Ops-- how did I know you were going to say that...
[GMT 09/22/05 14:55:04] <GregStossmeister-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43rf, Thanks -We understand no secondary wind max.

[GMT 09/22/05 14:56:39] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Jasmine-nrlp3 Just to make sure we are all clear on the plan when you reach the IP and have band in sight we'll want you to start first upwind for approx 60 nm then reverse track and go downwind. Are we on the same page?
[GMT 09/22/05 14:57:13] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- yes, we were just discussing that
[GMT 09/22/05 14:57:45] <BradSmull-NRL> GregStossmeister-Ops,  thanks for the "broad brush"--very helpful

[GMT 09/22/05 14:58:12] <Jasmine-nrlp3> JimMoore-Ops--just to triple check, no drops on the upwind legs, correct?
[GMT 09/22/05 14:59:06] <RobRogers-NOAA43> 2nd rainex drop away, in SW eyewall
[GMT 09/22/05 14:59:41] <JimMoore-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, Downwind legs only-  7 min spacing -- right you are
[GMT 09/22/05 14:59:55] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Ops - max flight level winds in SW eyewall only 115 knots
[GMT 09/22/05 15:00:12] <Jasmine-nrlp3> JimMoore-Ops-- thanks, can't hurt to be sure.  That's what we'll do!
[GMT 09/22/05 15:01:28] <JimMoore-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, Correct, until Shuyi adjusts :-) (I just learned how to make the face!!
[GMT 09/22/05 15:02:23] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Ops - that "outer eyewall" is actual a spiral band that connects to that big spiral that NRL is working
[GMT 09/22/05 15:02:37] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Ops - center dropsonde sfc pressure 913 mb

[GMT 09/22/05 15:04:30] <RobRogers-NOAA43> just did a rainex drop here, some indication of a wind max here
[GMT 09/22/05 15:04:49] <BradSmull-NRL> NRL has intense outer rainband immed S of our track at 27.75/85

[GMT 09/22/05 16:34:17] <RobRogers-N43> but FL winds only show a marginal (5-10 kt peak) on the SW and SE sides only
[GMT 09/22/05 16:34:22] <BradSmull-NRL> DaveJorgensen-n43, glad to have you here!
[GMT 09/22/05 16:34:23] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- yes, I chuckled, but I understood.  ;-)
[GMT 09/22/05 16:34:46] <BradSmull-NRL> DaveJorgensen-n43, how has your ride been lately?
[GMT 09/22/05 16:34:49] <RobRogers-N43> on the NE and NW side there is little or no secondary wind max
[GMT 09/22/05 16:35:19] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Brad - we've just exited the eye toward the NW
[GMT 09/22/05 16:35:25] <JimMoore-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, COnfirm drops away as scheduled?
[GMT 09/22/05 16:35:31] pchang_n42 (paul_n42@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Ping timeout
[GMT 09/22/05 16:35:39] <Jasmine-nrlp3> JimMoore-Ops-- yes, second one just away!
[GMT 09/22/05 16:35:48] <BradSmull-NRL> Ops - Does Rob Rogers observation re: wind max portend anything for quadrant choice for our future legs?
[GMT 09/22/05 16:35:48] mblack_ (mblack@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Ping timeout
[GMT 09/22/05 16:35:54] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Brad - there are no significant bands in the SW quad
[GMT 09/22/05 16:35:58] <Jasmine-nrlp3> JimMoore-Ops-- Every 7 min, as scheduled.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:36:13] <BradSmull-NRL> Thx Dave
[GMT 09/22/05 16:36:25] <BradSmull-NRL> We have nice bands here on SE-->NE side
[GMT 09/22/05 16:36:26] <Jasmine-nrlp3> JimMoore-Ops-- are we to still drop through point A to point D?
[GMT 09/22/05 16:36:27] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Brad - large band on N and NE sides spirals in to merge with the "outer" eyewall on the W side
[GMT 09/22/05 16:36:46] <BradSmull-NRL> Understood Dave
[GMT 09/22/05 16:37:05] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Brad - its been an extreamly SMOOTH ride so far - even in the eyewall penetrations
[GMT 09/22/05 16:37:05] <JimMoore-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, You got it, all the way around
[GMT 09/22/05 16:37:36] <Jasmine-nrlp3> JimMoore-Ops-- ok, i got it and you got it!
[GMT 09/22/05 16:38:17] <JimMoore-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Can you do a favor and find out the 42 pattern for us.  They are coming and going--comms wise
[GMT 09/22/05 16:38:21] <ShuyiChen-opc> Rob: did you drop a sonde on the outer "eyewall" band? 
[GMT 09/22/05 16:38:53] <BradSmull-NRL> Dave--we found some real "meat" in Rita's outer rainbands.... 50 dBZ and mdt turbulence. But in-close to center has definitely been smoother
[GMT 09/22/05 16:39:17] <BradSmull-NRL> JimMoore-Ops, We'll try
[GMT 09/22/05 16:39:24] <Deanna-ops> we are currently receiving everything but N42's 1hz stream
[GMT 09/22/05 16:39:34] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Ops - we're doing a figure 4 oriented NE - SW - SE - NW
[GMT 09/22/05 16:39:36] <Deanna-ops> terry, thanks for getting everything back up!
[GMT 09/22/05 16:39:39] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Jasmine-nrlp3 How does the band that you have been working look now? still well defined?
[GMT 09/22/05 16:39:40] <BradSmull-NRL> JimMoore-Ops, no contact established w/ 42 as yet
[GMT 09/22/05 16:39:48] <DaveJorgensen-n43> we're currently outbound on NW leg
[GMT 09/22/05 16:40:07] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, understand no contact with 42 yet.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:40:21] <BradSmull-NRL> JimMoore-Ops, Just had contact w/ 42--passing your question
[GMT 09/22/05 16:40:58] <BradSmull-NRL> BobHouze-Ops, GregStossmeister-Ops We
[GMT 09/22/05 16:41:17] <BradSmull-NRL> We;re in yet another "band-rich" environment... i.e. a multiplicity of bands
[GMT 09/22/05 16:41:45] <BradSmull-NRL> Though the one just inside (W of) our track remains the most coherent
[GMT 09/22/05 16:42:17] <RobRogers-N43> shuyi, yes we did
[GMT 09/22/05 16:42:31] <RobRogers-N43> we've done RAINEX drops in the outer "eyewall" in the SW, SE, and NW sides
[GMT 09/22/05 16:42:44] pchang_n42 (paul_n42@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &RAINEX.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:42:50] <RobRogers-N43> we did not do one on the initial inbound leg, on the NE side, b/c there was no evidence of a FL wind peak there
[GMT 09/22/05 16:43:10] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- we are to turn around at point D, correct?
[GMT 09/22/05 16:43:18] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, At point D you are going to reverse track back to point A following the band immediately to your west then reversing again at point A to go downwind to a point we have not yet given you yet correct?

[GMT 09/22/05 16:43:27] <ShuyiChen-opc> Thx, Rob. are you going into 2nd figure 4 of the day?
[GMT 09/22/05 16:43:37] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- reverse to point A, with no drops on our upwind?
[GMT 09/22/05 16:44:03] <BradSmull-NRL> Dave--what's your most recent central pressure ob?
[GMT 09/22/05 16:44:05] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, correct.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:44:15] <RobRogers-N43> we will be shortly....do you want me to drop more RAINEX sondes if there is a secondary FL wind max?
[GMT 09/22/05 16:44:18] <DaveJorgensen-n43> 915 mb by dropsonde
[GMT 09/22/05 16:44:46] Nick change: mblack -> MikeB-n42
[GMT 09/22/05 16:45:08] <BradSmull-NRL> DaveJorgensen-n43, Thx. We now see the eyewall on our nose radar
[GMT 09/22/05 16:45:49] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- ok, thanks.  We're about to turn.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:46:00] <MikeB-n42> n42 position is 25.6/86.7 tracking 270 towards eye
[GMT 09/22/05 16:46:08] <marks-hrd> MBlack - what time did you guys take off?

[GMT 09/22/05 16:46:39] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Brad - any thought of putting your track between the eyewall and the rainband on E and N sides?
[GMT 09/22/05 16:46:45] <marks-hrd> Any Doppler analyses from 43 yest for John?
[GMT 09/22/05 16:47:19] <BradSmull-NRL> DaveJorgensen-n43, Wen-Chau and I considered it, but Ops seems to like us out at this larger radius.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:47:22] <JimMoore-Ops> MikeB, What will be the west endpoint?
[GMT 09/22/05 16:47:28] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, and BradSmull-NRL We want to revise your upwind turn point instead of Pt. A it will be Pt. E - stand by for Pt. E coordinates.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:47:30] <DaveJorgensen-n43> No Frank, Shirley has been too busy working up the drops - lotsa drops today
[GMT 09/22/05 16:47:36] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Ops--NRL is turning, last sond on this downwind leg is away.  Will stop drops until our next downwind leg
[GMT 09/22/05 16:47:43] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- ok, standing by
[GMT 09/22/05 16:48:26] <DaveJorgensen-n43> OK Brad, its a very smooth ride today so I thought you might want to look at that "secondary" eyewall and eyewall on the same pass
[GMT 09/22/05 16:48:34] <terry-n43> are you getting the 1 hz feed now
[GMT 09/22/05 16:49:03] <Deanna-ops> terry-n43, yes we're getting 1hz now...thanks!
[GMT 09/22/05 16:49:52] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Jasmine-nrlp3 Nevermind just go back to point A. sorry. Whenyou get to point A, reverse track and we'll head you downwind to the next point (not yet given) past point D.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:50:19] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- ok, that makes it easy on us!  Thanks for the update
[GMT 09/22/05 16:50:35] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, At your service.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:50:59] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, BradSmull-NRL tell us what it looks like on the tail radar to your right during the next 15 nm
[GMT 09/22/05 16:51:18] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- one more service, once we reverse on point A, do we continue 7 min drops?
[GMT 09/22/05 16:51:27] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- you got it, we'll let ya know.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:51:43] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, only drop on downwind legs.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:52:10] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Yes, we will, but do we drop all the way from A to our yet-to-be-given point E?
[GMT 09/22/05 16:52:43] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, BradSmull-NRL if it looks smooth in that part of the band we may pull you in to the next band inward, which is the 2ndary eyewall and the most important feature of the day
[GMT 09/22/05 16:53:09] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, Shuyi says yes - we always want you dropping every 7 when moving downwind.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:53:16] <JessicaKoury-ops> N42, we have lost your 1Hz data stream in Ops (although your LF data is coming in fine)

[GMT 09/22/05 16:53:34] <ShuyiChen-opc> Rob: on your next leg cross the center, drop a sonde in the outer eyewall, one in the mode between the inner and outer eyewall.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:53:36] <BradSmull-NRL> BobHouze-Ops, Peak fallstreak dBZ's are in 30-40 dBZ range, ocnl 45 dBZ, with some 25+ dBZ convective like enhancements above the bright band
[GMT 09/22/05 16:53:49] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, BradSmull-NRL this really looks like a replacement cycle, and it would be good to get you in to that next band when you come back downwind
[GMT 09/22/05 16:54:00] <BradSmull-NRL> BobHouze-Ops, Anvil-like signatures (plumes embedded within broader anvil echo) are tilting outward in a radial sense
[GMT 09/22/05 16:54:09] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Ops - on our last pass from the SE through that secondary eyewall it appeared fairly stratiform with only a few embedded cells
[GMT 09/22/05 16:54:29] <BradSmull-NRL> Overall, it's a bit like a cross section through an MCS, except this "stratiform" region is interrupted w/ occasional convective bands. 
[GMT 09/22/05 16:54:33] <GregStossmeister-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, Thanks Dave.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:54:40] <marks-hrd> Rob: can you go to #hrd?
[GMT 09/22/05 16:55:09] <JimMoore-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, On hi res sat, we can see the cirrus streaks radily outward from the center--quite pretty
[GMT 09/22/05 16:55:13] MikeB-n42 (mblack@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &RAINEX.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:55:26] <MikeB-n42> Ops, we were thinking 1 drop in outer eyewall on each corner of Fig 4, how does that sound?
[GMT 09/22/05 16:55:27] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- ok, I heard word of not dropping in the "transition" legs, but if you tell us to drop all the way from point A to point E, that's what we'll be doing
[GMT 09/22/05 16:55:35] <BradSmull-NRL> BobHouze-Ops, we are seeing evidence of spiral bands propagating outward from center with time
[GMT 09/22/05 16:55:59] <JessicaKoury-ops> N42 data streams are back up in Ops, thank you.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:56:10] pchang_n42 (paul_n42@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &RAINEX.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:56:22] <Jasmine-nrlp3> StacyBrodzik-Ops-- is 42's LF image reasonable from where you're looking?  It seems a bit over done, but perhaps they're in clear air and introducing some sea clutter
[GMT 09/22/05 16:56:31] <BradSmull-NRL> BobHouze-Ops, we understand and agree with your recommendation to shift to more inner band on our return (upwind) leg
[GMT 09/22/05 16:56:32] <ShuyiChen-opc> MikeB-42: I'd like to drop on the outer eyewall, not the corner point.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:56:45] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, BradSmull-NRL After reaching point A we want to bring you inbound to secondary band just inside band you are working. So after flying to pint A. Head WSW to pt E (25.6/88.2) then from there downwind to point F (26.1/88.7) understand?
[GMT 09/22/05 16:56:57] <BradSmull-NRL> DaveJorgensen-n43, note that we are going to follow your earlier suggestion
[GMT 09/22/05 16:57:13] <DaveJorgensen-n43> OK Brad - I thought that was the best show in town today
[GMT 09/22/05 16:57:16] <ShuyiChen-opc> MikeB: what is the radius of your figure 4?
[GMT 09/22/05 16:57:16] <BradSmull-NRL> GregStossmeister-Ops, we copy those points
[GMT 09/22/05 16:57:26] <BradSmull-NRL> thanks
[GMT 09/22/05 16:57:40] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Thanks. As usual follow the band down wind, not a straight line.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:57:43] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Brad - you can try flying outside that band and then perhaps between the eyewall and that band
[GMT 09/22/05 16:57:44] <MikeB-n42> ShuyiChen-opc, that's what we meant. We will target a wind max.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:57:57] <marks-hrd> Rob: can you go to #hrd?
[GMT 09/22/05 16:58:38] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, it seems like the 42's radar tilt is causing lots of sea clutter to show up in the image
[GMT 09/22/05 16:58:41] <ShuyiChen-opc> MikeB, if the 2nd wind max is not clear, drop on the max reflective (rainband). Thx.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:58:56] <Jasmine-nrlp3> ok, that's what I thought.
[GMT 09/22/05 16:58:57] <DaveJorgensen-n43> BTW out last central pressure via dropsonde was 914.9 mb
[GMT 09/22/05 17:00:04] <Jasmine-nrlp3> StacyBrodzik-Ops-- if it starts to smear out features from 43, is it possible to turn off 42's LF in the composite?

[GMT 09/22/05 17:02:41] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Jasmine-nrlp3 when you get in you will go downwind adjacent the 2ndary eyewall forming as part of the apparent replacement cycle
[GMT 09/22/05 17:03:13] <marks-hrd> Rob: can you go to #hrd?
[GMT 09/22/05 17:03:23] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, the 2ndary eyewall looks closed in the full lf composite
[GMT 09/22/05 17:03:29] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- we've crossed the band, no problems
[GMT 09/22/05 17:03:35] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- We're turning around now to head downwind
[GMT 09/22/05 17:03:47] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, Excellent - thanks!
[GMT 09/22/05 17:03:59] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- great, thanks for the info.
[GMT 09/22/05 17:04:14] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Ops--we'll start drops every 7 min once we finish our turn
[GMT 09/22/05 17:04:49] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Ops--we are to drop all the way from point E to point F, correct?
[GMT 09/22/05 17:04:52] <ShuyiChen-opc> Thx, Dave. That means two sondes in the E and two W side. 
[GMT 09/22/05 17:05:05] <BradSmull-NRL> BobHouze-Ops, we are thrilled with prospect of continuing data collection in this mode/locaion,which is very similar to the last phase of our flight yesterday
[GMT 09/22/05 17:05:10] <terry> frank its eric....he is off the computer at the moment. ill let him know.
[GMT 09/22/05 17:05:29] <marks-hrd> Thanks Eric I want to pass Shirley flight info
[GMT 09/22/05 17:06:04] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, BradSmull-NRL Once you get set up on the secondary eyewall we'll want you to fly downwind through Pt F. to Pt. G which is 25.9/89.3 following the band. Does that makes sense?
[GMT 09/22/05 17:06:04] <marks-hrd> Pete says first leg of SFMR from 43 looked great
[GMT 09/22/05 17:06:35] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- ok, sounds good.
[GMT 09/22/05 17:06:43] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, yes this will be eaasy fro you to execute and valuable data

[GMT 09/22/05 17:10:20] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- drops all the way through pt G, correct?
[GMT 09/22/05 17:11:00] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine Yes - by the way we are thinking now that we have you on the secondary eyewall of having you do a full cicuit downwind - no upwind passes.
[GMT 09/22/05 17:11:18] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, Standby for confirmation on that.

[GMT 09/22/05 17:12:32] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- that sounds good to us, just let us know if you want us to keep dropping sondes if that's the plan
[GMT 09/22/05 17:12:44] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, BradSmull-NRL OK we confirm we'd like you to follow the band all the way around full circle. We'd like you to tuck in close keeping it on your left.
[GMT 09/22/05 17:13:07] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, BradSmull-NRL If you drift away from it we'll let you know to correct your track.
[GMT 09/22/05 17:13:20] <BradSmull-NRL> GregStossmeister-Ops, We'll really zip--we have a 90kt tailwind at this radius!
[GMT 09/22/05 17:13:24] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, Keep dropping sondes downwind.
[GMT 09/22/05 17:13:41] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- ok, copy that.  That's a lot of drops, let us know if you still want 7 min intervals
[GMT 09/22/05 17:13:49] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Understand it won't take long. Let us know if you need points.
[GMT 09/22/05 17:14:13] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- thanks, we'll appreciate any corrections
[GMT 09/22/05 17:14:26] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, thinking ahead, we would like to go around more than once
[GMT 09/22/05 17:14:28] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- ok, sondes will be dropped every 7 min!
[GMT 09/22/05 17:14:33] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, It will be under an hour trip so will not take that many sondes dropping every 7min.
[GMT 09/22/05 17:14:52] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- ok, sounds good

[GMT 09/22/05 17:34:41] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, what did you see on the tail radar to your right in the SW quadrant?
[GMT 09/22/05 17:35:44] <BradSmull-NRL> BobHouze-Ops, That is the area where we were in the midst of a broad band-it was pretty stratiform. More convective/narrow-intense structure has been confined to left side of our track
[GMT 09/22/05 17:36:08] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- BobHouze-Ops--are we going to circumnavigate this one more time?
[GMT 09/22/05 17:36:13] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, that's what I expected

[GMT 09/22/05 17:36:56] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- that's good news, thanks for the update!!
[GMT 09/22/05 17:36:58] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, shame on you!
[GMT 09/22/05 17:36:59] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, BradSmull-NRL Yes - we want you to do another circuit.

[GMT 09/22/05 17:44:26] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Something to keep in mind this circuit - How broken is this secondary eyewall. We are entertaining the idea of getting you inside the secondary eyewall for one circuit if we see an opportunity.
[GMT 09/22/05 17:45:48] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, But we wouldn't do that anytime soon.
[GMT 09/22/05 17:46:02] <Jasmine-nrlp3> StacyBrodzik-Ops--ok, we're calliin' them now
[GMT 09/22/05 17:46:10] <BradSmull-NRL> GregStossmeister-Ops, Hmmmmm... that looks a bit tough, as much as we would LIKE to do so. We'll think/watch more about it
[GMT 09/22/05 17:46:17] <ShuyiChen-opc> Brad: The mode area in bwteen the two eyewalls is very stable. 
[GMT 09/22/05 17:46:28] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Exactly - only a thought.
[GMT 09/22/05 17:46:45] <Jasmine-nrlp3> StacyBrodzik-Ops-- they might just be out of coverage, but we're checking
[GMT 09/22/05 17:47:14] <BradSmull-NRL> ShuyiChen-opc, yes, we agree, however the problem is that the "secondary eyewall" just inside our flight radius is fairly intense and we would need to cross it. We're evaluating
[GMT 09/22/05 17:47:26] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, We're still thinking about that patch for you all ;-)

[GMT 09/22/05 17:48:46] <Jasmine-nrlp3> StacyBrodzik-Ops-- they said they're out of global star coverage right now, and can only transmit either LF or 1 Hz.
[GMT 09/22/05 17:49:14] <Jasmine-nrlp3> StacyBrodzik-Ops-- once they get back on G*, they'll transmit 1 Hz.  Of course, they understand that LF is much more important at this stage

[GMT 09/22/05 17:51:19] <BradSmull-NRL> Ops, if we were to go in, how long would we stay in? and how likely is it that secondary eyewall would intensify over that period and make exit difficult?

[GMT 09/22/05 18:09:07] <RobRogers-N43> shuyi -- here's a drop update: on the inbound leg from the SW to the NE, I dropped a rainex sonde just inside the outer eyewall and in the moat region.
[GMT 09/22/05 18:09:23] <RobRogers-N43> neither of those worked, however, unfortunately
[GMT 09/22/05 18:09:38] <RobRogers-N43> there was then a NHC drop at the surface wind max on the inner eyewall
[GMT 09/22/05 18:10:06] <RobRogers-N43> On the SW side there was a pretty notable wind max through that outer eyewall
[GMT 09/22/05 18:10:27] <RobRogers-N43> on the outbound leg to the NE, I dropped a sonde in the moat region.  That one worked.
[GMT 09/22/05 18:11:37] <RobRogers-N43> I was going to drop another sonde at the inner edge of the outer eyewall, but the LF radar froze up and I missed when we passed through (it was pretty broken up anyway).
[GMT 09/22/05 18:11:55] <RobRogers-N43> there was not much of a signal in the FL wind field though anyway

[GMT 09/22/05 18:12:41] <RobRogers-N43> so the storm seems to continue to show a FL wind peak indicative of a secondary eyewall in the SW and SE quads, but not in the NW and NE quads
[GMT 09/22/05 18:12:56] <ShuyiChen-opc> NRL is inside of the outer eyewall and dropping sondes in the moat region.

[GMT 09/22/05 18:23:56] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, that seems to confirm the replacement cycle
[GMT 09/22/05 18:24:28] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- i would say so!
[GMT 09/22/05 18:25:03] <Jasmine-nrlp3> We've been getting fantastic data of both sides of the inner eyewall and our side of the outer eyewall
[GMT 09/22/05 18:25:18] <DaveJorgensen-n43> we're still working on the problem Stacy, shouldn't be too much longer
[GMT 09/22/05 18:25:31] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, thanks
[GMT 09/22/05 18:25:51] <DaveJorgensen-n43> we were all strapped into the seats due to turb, and couldn't reach the sys to reboot - now we're out of our seats again
[GMT 09/22/05 18:26:31] <BradSmull-nrl> Ops-sea state far exceeds anything I have ever seen (only small glimpses possible here outside eyewall)
[GMT 09/22/05 18:27:06] <DaveJorgensen-n43> BradSmull-nrl, You have a pretty good tracking going Brad . . . round and round
[GMT 09/22/05 18:28:00] <BradSmull-nrl> Yep Dave--it's our day at the carnival :-)
[GMT 09/22/05 18:28:21] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, don't get dizzy
[GMT 09/22/05 18:28:24] <DaveJorgensen-n43> its a cool pattern . . . wish we could join you!
[GMT 09/22/05 18:29:03] <DaveJorgensen-n43> I hope that outer eye doesn't fill in and go convective, you might be stuck in there till landfall  .  . like that bird we saw yesterday
[GMT 09/22/05 18:29:33] <Jasmine-nrlp3> DaveJorgensen-n43-- I was thinking the same thing!  Luckily we're getting out of here very soon
[GMT 09/22/05 18:29:41] <BradSmull-nrl> Dave--trust me, we share your hope!
[GMT 09/22/05 18:30:06] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- do we have an update on Rita? (well, we know where the center is, but anything else).
[GMT 09/22/05 18:30:18] <BradSmull-nrl> BobHouze-Ops, it's too late--I was dizzy when I woke up this morning
[GMT 09/22/05 18:30:25] <DaveJorgensen-n43> it looked pretty stratiform when we last passed through it
[GMT 09/22/05 18:30:34] <ShuyiChen-opc> Dave: it's funny! It will happen, but slowly.
[GMT 09/22/05 18:30:55] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, Shuyi is looking up the latest updates
[GMT 09/22/05 18:31:08] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops--great, thanks
[GMT 09/22/05 18:32:25] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Ok, we're finding a soft spot to exit now

[GMT 09/22/05 18:32:46] <DaveJorgensen-n43> I agree Shuyi, soon the inner eye will die and the outer will start to contract again . . reintensification probably tonight  tomorrows flight should be pretty interesting too
[GMT 09/22/05 18:33:12] <BradSmull-nrl> NRL preparing to exit 
[GMT 09/22/05 18:33:12] <BradSmull-nrl> I  mean exit secondary eyewall
[GMT 09/22/05 18:33:28] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, When you exit resume your downwind circuits on the outside of the secoondary eyewall please.
[GMT 09/22/05 18:34:03] <DaveJorgensen-n43> BradSmull-nrl, you guys feeling too much centrufugal force?

[GMT 09/22/05 18:37:14] <DaveJorgensen-n43> super Ops!
[GMT 09/22/05 18:37:17] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, how much of a bump did you get?
[GMT 09/22/05 18:37:47] <BradSmull-nrl> Turning to resume our outer radius downwind track. 
[GMT 09/22/05 18:37:47] <BradSmull-nrl> Ops-do you want us to resume dropping on this outer downwind leg?
[GMT 09/22/05 18:37:49] <BradSmull-nrl> Well Dave, if you see me walking around later today leaning to the left... you'll know why!
[GMT 09/22/05 18:38:14] <BradSmull-nrl> DaveJorgensen-n43, Ask Barry if we get our penetration patches now....

[GMT 09/22/05 18:39:13] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, dropsonde pattern for NRL
[GMT 09/22/05 18:39:23] <ShuyiChen-opc> Jasmine: landfall intensity is still uncertain, partly depends on the eyewall replacement cycle we're looking at it. NHC keep it as Cat 4.

[GMT 09/22/05 18:40:17] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Ok, thanks Shuyi.
[GMT 09/22/05 18:40:26] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- got it
[GMT 09/22/05 18:40:59] <DaveJorgensen-n43> no Brad, you guys wimped out and only get a half a patch for penetrating only the outer wall
[GMT 09/22/05 18:41:26] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Only flyers with the "right stuff" can penetrate all the way
[GMT 09/22/05 18:42:11] <ShuyiChen-opc> Jasmine, I mean Cat 4 at landfall, according to NHC.
[GMT 09/22/05 18:42:25] <BradSmull-nrl> DaveJorgensen-n43, that's exactly what Carl predicted Barry would say!

[GMT 09/22/05 18:47:18] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, Actually I lost the bet - I was sure you guys would somehow wander into the eye #accidentally#
[GMT 09/22/05 18:47:52] <BradSmull-nrl> GregStossmeister-Ops, it ALMOST happened!  I was of course in the back of the AC monitoring sea state--it would have been on WenChau's watch
[GMT 09/22/05 18:48:28] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, I thought your track was looking perilously close to a penetration!

[GMT 09/22/05 18:53:10] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, speaking of wandering into something are you crossing the secondary eyewall again? It looks like that here.
[GMT 09/22/05 18:53:30] <BradSmull-nrl> Ops--we are presently tracking down mid-axis of broad rainband which ultimately spirals into center. we are thus going to edge right to avoid re-inserting oureselves inside secondary eyewall
[GMT 09/22/05 18:53:48] <jmoore_> Jasmine-nrlp3, SO are you outside the band, or right in the band??
[GMT 09/22/05 18:53:58] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-nrl, OK thanks for the explanation.
[GMT 09/22/05 18:54:23] <Jasmine-nrlp3> So Ops, you think you want to send us around again?

[GMT 09/22/05 18:54:55] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- we're fixing that
[GMT 09/22/05 18:55:06] <BradSmull-nrl> Ops, this is what happens when we follow a "spiral band", it can only go inward!
[GMT 09/22/05 18:55:34] <Jasmine-nrlp3> JimMoore-Ops-- we're getting outside now

[GMT 09/22/05 19:18:52] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Brad - we plan on finishing our SW pass then return to eye then exit to NE and RTB
[GMT 09/22/05 19:18:58] <JimMoore-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Our view is to head out (NNE) of the system after you go as far around to the north as possible.  Then head NNE to intersect about 27.5 (this may chnage as outer bands rotate)and head for TPA
[GMT 09/22/05 19:19:09] <BradSmull-NRL> Dave--your ETA at NE point?
[GMT 09/22/05 19:19:31] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> I'll check Brad
[GMT 09/22/05 19:19:41] <BradSmull-NRL> JimMoore-Ops, we copy. Ideally we are coordinating w/ 43 to stay in their LF coverage, correct?
[GMT 09/22/05 19:20:13] <JimMoore-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Yessir-- but I am not quite sure of their timing.
[GMT 09/22/05 19:20:51] <BradSmull-NRL> JimMoore-Ops, DaveJ is working on that issue now and will report back shortly
[GMT 09/22/05 19:21:26] <JimMoore-Ops> In general, there are some outer bands of fair strength to the north and east of the main storm circulation.  Good news is that path I described back to TPA is relatively echo free although changes are possible.
[GMT 09/22/05 19:21:30] <BradSmull-NRL> NRL is willing to loiter in NE quadrant for a bit if necessary. We'll gladly ride home on N43RF's coattails  ;-)
[GMT 09/22/05 19:21:39] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Brad - we will go to the NE corner by 2010
[GMT 09/22/05 19:21:44] <BradSmull-NRL> Which is another way of saying--our ride INTO Rita was more exciting than we wished
[GMT 09/22/05 19:21:49] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> UTC
[GMT 09/22/05 19:22:04] <JimMoore-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, That is good--it will allow the most direct routing
[GMT 09/22/05 19:22:57] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Ops, our last eye dropsonde had a spash pressure of 913 mb
[GMT 09/22/05 19:23:11] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Jasmine-nrlp3 why are you deviating?
[GMT 09/22/05 19:24:06] <BradSmull-NRL> JimMoore-Ops, Perhaps we can exit ahead of 43 but still within their swath of LF coverage. We will arrive at NNE point in about 25 min (near 1950 UTC). That is 20 min ahead of 43's expected arrival in that part of storm
[GMT 09/22/05 19:24:22] <BradSmull-NRL> JimMoore-Ops, OK, sounds like plan. But if flight begins to feel uncomfortable on our outbound track, we will not hesitate to loiter to await 43's arrival--deal?
[GMT 09/22/05 19:24:38] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, we need for you to stay on the secondary eyewall till you get on NE or N side of storm
[GMT 09/22/05 19:24:58] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- we were getting sucked back into the outer eyewall again.  The spiraling bands were were following were leading us back in
[GMT 09/22/05 19:25:15] <BradSmull-NRL> Bob... in this case we do NOT want to "follow the yellow-brick road". It leads inside the secondary eyewall
[GMT 09/22/05 19:25:28] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, If you have time you can reverse tracks up North to wait fro 43.
[GMT 09/22/05 19:25:49] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- I see what you're talking about
[GMT 09/22/05 19:26:08] <BradSmull-NRL> So every time we reach SE quadrant, where bands are strongly inclined toward center, we are forced to cross them (radially outward) to avoid that
[GMT 09/22/05 19:27:14] <BradSmull-NRL> BobHouze-Ops, our ELDORA coverage at this radius still extends from eyewall outward--ideal in our view
[GMT 09/22/05 19:27:35] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- we're moving closer in now
[GMT 09/22/05 19:27:52] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Jasmine-nrlp3 here are points to follow: go to point H 25.8/88.7 then to point I 26.1/88.8
[GMT 09/22/05 19:28:01] <Jasmine-nrlp3> We had a band sneaking into the outer eyewall, and had to deviate around it
[GMT 09/22/05 19:28:25] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, ok I see that now on 43's lf
[GMT 09/22/05 19:28:43] <BradSmull-NRL> JimMoore-Ops, Flight suggests a further circuit and exit NE-bound from SE quadrant so as to keep better (tail-) winds. Is that track dis-favored in terms of convection enroute?
[GMT 09/22/05 19:29:07] <BradSmull-NRL> BobHouze-Ops, thanks for points, we copy. Just passing along Nav's suggestoin for your consideration.
[GMT 09/22/05 19:29:30] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, we have no objection to that
[GMT 09/22/05 19:29:45] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops--those points were to follow around the outer eyewall, correct?
[GMT 09/22/05 19:30:16] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, Yes they were .
[GMT 09/22/05 19:30:17] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- those weren't exit points...right?
[GMT 09/22/05 19:30:37] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, They were not exit points.
[GMT 09/22/05 19:30:40] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- thanks, just had to make sure!
[GMT 09/22/05 19:30:51] <BradSmull-NRL> BobHouze-Ops, we note that we might not have LF coverage if we follow strategy of exit from SE quadrant... it's a "quadrant quandry". 
[GMT 09/22/05 19:31:29] <BradSmull-NRL> We'd likely be most comfortable loitering in NNE part of storm if necessary and following 43 out with benefit of superior LF 
[GMT 09/22/05 19:31:37] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, right, those were NOT exit points. they are points to keep you near the 2ndary eyewall
[GMT 09/22/05 19:32:02] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> BradSmull-nrl, we will go back into the eye from the NE to make a fix at 2035Z, then exit toward NE to RTB
[GMT 09/22/05 19:32:17] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- gotcha
[GMT 09/22/05 19:33:53] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, on the north side you will see a discontinuity in the secondary eyewall. You will need to shift radially out to stay outside the secondary eyewall
[GMT 09/22/05 19:33:56] <BradSmull-NRL> Ops--if N43 is going to be here another hour, theywill not achieve a landing prior to 1800 EDT as we must. Thus we probably need to exit shorly (even if it's without LF guidance)
[GMT 09/22/05 19:33:56] <BradSmull-NRL> So any satellite-based guidance would be appreciated. We saw Jim's rec re: NNE-bound exit earlier
[GMT 09/22/05 19:34:11] <BradSmull-NRL> DaveJorgensen-n43rf, thx for your update
[GMT 09/22/05 19:34:46] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- ok
[GMT 09/22/05 19:34:50] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> BradSmull-NRL, welcome Brad. 
[GMT 09/22/05 19:35:08] <Jasmine-nrlp3> We just dropped the NE sonde.  That's the last one, correct?
[GMT 09/22/05 19:35:14] <JimMoore-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Sat shows tight circulation where you have been showing off--I mean flying the past couple of hours 
[GMT 09/22/05 19:35:29] <BradSmull-NRL> Ops- Our plan is to exit N along 89 W until we reach 27 N, then track ENE.
[GMT 09/22/05 19:35:32] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43rf, RobRogers-NOAA43 do you have contact with 42. We have not gotten lf data from them in 20 minutes
[GMT 09/22/05 19:35:50] <Jasmine-nrlp3> JimMoore-Ops-- hey, we resemble...I mean...resent that remark
[GMT 09/22/05 19:36:03] <BradSmull-NRL> C'mon JimMoore-Ops, every air-crew deserves their day in the sun (or at the carnival or whatever it is we've been doing)
[GMT 09/22/05 19:36:34] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> I'll check Bob.
[GMT 09/22/05 19:36:41] <Jasmine-nrlp3> OPS--we think we can do another lap and then follow 43 home.  How does that sounds to you?
[GMT 09/22/05 19:37:03] <JimMoore-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Then outer more convective bands are displaced .5. to 1 degree (60 nmi or so) to the N and E.
[GMT 09/22/05 19:37:33] <JimMoore-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, We are trying to bring you out S and E of those outer bands--Also we have 88D data to help
[GMT 09/22/05 19:37:35] <Jasmine-nrlp3> OPS--do you want drops on this next round?
[GMT 09/22/05 19:37:44] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, you arer coming up on the point where you need to shift outward a bit
[GMT 09/22/05 19:38:01] <BradSmull-NRL> JimMoore-Ops, thanks
[GMT 09/22/05 19:38:08] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- ok
[GMT 09/22/05 19:38:18] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, standby for word on sondes
[GMT 09/22/05 19:38:22] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- thanks, we'll be very careful here
[GMT 09/22/05 19:38:57] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, another lap is good
[GMT 09/22/05 19:39:15] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, we are trying to get shuyi for word on sondes
[GMT 09/22/05 19:39:26] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- we agree, another lap=more data!

[GMT 09/22/05 19:40:22] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, no more sondes
[GMT 09/22/05 19:40:34] <BradSmull-NRL> BobHouze-Ops, further update--flight proposes to continue downwind to SE quadrant, then begin our exit NE-bound, bascally abeam (i.e. to the right) of 43's home-bound track
[GMT 09/22/05 19:40:43] <BradSmull-NRL> This will have dual advantage of good tailwinds and, presumably, LF coverage
[GMT 09/22/05 19:40:45] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- ok, copy that, no more sondes
[GMT 09/22/05 19:41:37] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Brad, we're at our SE corner point - turning downwind for the run to our NE corner point
[GMT 09/22/05 19:41:59] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, BradSmull-NRL we are getting mixed messages from the 2 of you. we think it is better to circuit around to the NE on the feature and THEN exit NE. Otherwise you'll get more convection
[GMT 09/22/05 19:42:37] <BradSmull-NRL> DaveJorgensen-n43rf, we copy. Our flight crew is vascillating...We see Bob's recommendation to exit toward NE and will follow that
[GMT 09/22/05 19:42:52] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Hopefully our LF coverage will extend E enough for you to see a good exit
[GMT 09/22/05 19:43:12] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, BradSmull-NRL there is a lot of convective band activitySE and E of the storm
[GMT 09/22/05 19:43:27] <Jasmine-nrlp3> StacyBrodzik-Ops-- it's turned to night again on our image...FYI
[GMT 09/22/05 19:43:49] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- yes, we can see that from LF (or, saw that from the last image)
[GMT 09/22/05 19:43:56] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Brad there are more bands (and stronger too) to the E, they kinda peter out to the NE
[GMT 09/22/05 19:44:05] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, we like to send you one of those once per flight to keep you on your toes:-)
[GMT 09/22/05 19:44:14] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, we agree with Dave
[GMT 09/22/05 19:44:38] <Jasmine-nrlp3> StacyBrodzik-Ops-- hey, it proves I'm awake up here, I suppose
[GMT 09/22/05 19:44:45] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> pchang_n42, we haven't gotten lf data for almost 30 minutes; is that being looked into?
[GMT 09/22/05 19:45:03] <BradSmull-NRL> We also agree with Dave. We were simply responding to a request from our flight deck for more favorable exit winds. We will opt instead for reduced convection enroute
[GMT 09/22/05 19:45:44] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, good, right decision

[GMT 09/22/05 20:06:09] <BradSmull-NRL> Ops--any updates on convection to N/NE of storm (GOES-based or otherwise)?

[GMT 09/22/05 20:07:16] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, It's still where Jim  told you come east along  about 27.4 to stay south of most of it.

[GMT 09/22/05 20:08:43] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Jasmine-nrlp3 we are not getting lf data from 43

[GMT 09/22/05 20:09:48] <BradSmull-NRL> Bob--good point--in that case, waiting/loitering doesn't buy us much
[GMT 09/22/05 20:10:06] <BradSmull-NRL> We will likely engineer our own exit subject to guidelines Greg/Jim have already passed
[GMT 09/22/05 20:11:34] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, So you are planning to head north to about 27.5 then head east is that the plan?
[GMT 09/22/05 20:11:56] <BradSmull-NRL> GregStossmeister-Ops, yes
[GMT 09/22/05 20:13:34] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Watch for isolated cells as you head northeast. When you get to about 88 West we'll have some 88D data to help as well.
[GMT 09/22/05 20:14:02] <BradSmull-NRL> GregStossmeister-Ops, NRL is beginning its N-bound exit
[GMT 09/22/05 20:14:13] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Ok Brad Thx.
[GMT 09/22/05 20:16:16] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, How's the ride so far?
[GMT 09/22/05 20:16:35] <BradSmull-NRL> Smooth! (but please don't jinx us!)
[GMT 09/22/05 20:16:37] <JimMoore> BradSmull-NRL, If not already started you can angle NE--assuming headwinds are acceptable
[GMT 09/22/05 20:17:38] <JimMoore> There will be several bands you cross in the near future no stronger than what you have already experienced in the main storm
[GMT 09/22/05 20:18:06] <BradSmull-NRL> JimMoore, Flight anticipated your suggestion--now tracking 060
[GMT 09/22/05 20:18:59] <BradSmull-NRL> Right Jim--but we remember well the outer convective bands from our initial approach into the storm. We'll be careful.
[GMT 09/22/05 20:19:30] <JimMoore> Once you are east of 86 along 27.5, there will be some embedded cells of modest DBZ
[GMT 09/22/05 20:20:00] <JimMoore> BradSmull-NRL, We will begin watchng Tampa 88D for updates
[GMT 09/22/05 20:20:25] <BradSmull-NRL> Thx Jim--as Willard Scott would say, we'll keep a "weather eye"
[GMT 09/22/05 20:21:24] <JimMoore> BradSmull-NRL, Also note that McDill is good at this time will usual PM convection NE and East
[GMT 09/22/05 20:22:13] <BradSmull-NRL> Thanks Jim, passed that along to our flight deck
[GMT 09/22/05 20:23:15] <BradSmull-NRL> We see taller cells both E and W of our track toward 030,but locally we seem to be in good shape. SF precip beneath us has some wild-looking *shallow* convection, however
[GMT 09/22/05 20:23:15] <BradSmull-NRL> embedded convection, that is
[GMT 09/22/05 20:24:22] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Do you have an ETA for arrival at McDill?
[GMT 09/22/05 20:24:33] <Jasmine-nrlp3> StacyBrodzik-Ops-- out of curiosity, on our images, what is the data to the north of 42's radar range?  where does that data come from?
[GMT 09/22/05 20:24:47] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- about 90 min
[GMT 09/22/05 20:24:49] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, 88D data
[GMT 09/22/05 20:25:02] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- ok, that's what I thought
[GMT 09/22/05 20:25:10] <Jasmine-nrlp3> didn't know we added that as well, sweet!

[GMT 09/22/05 20:26:30] <JimMoore> Jasmine-nrlp3, The 88Ds have a long range scan that is useful.  But we are cautous cause scans are pretty high in the cells and don't see the lower stronger areas
[GMT 09/22/05 20:26:54] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, Otis brought in a couple folks -- Dave Atlas and someone else -- and Bob and Shuyi are doing a little demo

[GMT 09/22/05 20:33:10] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, Always good to be part of a mutual admiration society.
[GMT 09/22/05 20:33:52] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, BradSmull-NRL Why are you flying SE toward more cells right now?
[GMT 09/22/05 20:34:36] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- yes, we've been dodging some stuff using our nose and ELDORA
[GMT 09/22/05 20:34:49] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, BradSmull-NRL If you come left about 10nmi it looks like it might be clearer.
[GMT 09/22/05 20:35:09] <BradSmull-NRL> Greg-we're threading our way. Cells are fairly widespread at low altitude. Now climbing to 17kft to try to get above the gunk--nothing TOO rough tho
[GMT 09/22/05 20:35:30] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> N43-Sta2: welcome back.  Any chance of LF data soon?
[GMT 09/22/05 20:35:47] <BradSmull-NRL> Greg--the world out here is fractal, i.e. how ever much detail you see, we can always find more on the nose radar   ;-)
[GMT 09/22/05 20:36:06] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, I believe it.
[GMT 09/22/05 20:36:08] <JimMoore> BradSmull-NRL, Great Brad-- This the part about the 88D sites being far away--as you know
[GMT 09/22/05 20:38:14] <BradSmull-NRL> Exactly, Jim.  This is where the rubber meets the road, in terms or radar meteorology at least
[GMT 09/22/05 20:38:55] <BradSmull-NRL> GregStossmeister-Ops, My previoius observaion is particularly true with respect to "rainbands'. I had NO idea that hurricanes had so many of the blasted things!
[GMT 09/22/05 20:39:16] <BradSmull-NRL> But we've (as a group) gotten MUCH better at finding our way, It hink
[GMT 09/22/05 20:39:25] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Not quite like our simple conceptual model huh.
[GMT 09/22/05 20:40:06] <JimMoore> BradSmull-NRL, Indeed-  Next cells we can see of "interest" are on your nose at Longitude 86.5
[GMT 09/22/05 20:40:11] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, have any of you heard from 43 lately?  we haven't gotten any data from them for almost an hour
[GMT 09/22/05 20:40:18] <BradSmull-NRL> Uhhh, no. But the simple model made a much better T-shirt
[GMT 09/22/05 20:40:49] <BradSmull-NRL> StacyBrodzik-Ops, no, not a word, either via chat or radio
[GMT 09/22/05 20:42:07] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, FYI, i misspoke earlier . . . our visitors are Bob Atlas and Judy Gray

[GMT 09/22/05 20:44:18] <JimMoore> BradSmull-NRL, By then, you may have some help from ATC as well--
[GMT 09/22/05 20:44:44] <BradSmull-NRL> Thanks Jim--will pass that along
[GMT 09/22/05 20:45:22] <JimMoore> BradSmull-NRL, What are the head/tail winds??

[GMT 09/22/05 20:46:37] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> terry-n43, do you guys have an ETA in Tampa?
[GMT 09/22/05 20:46:44] <BradSmull-NRL> 43--you've re-materialized!
[GMT 09/22/05 20:46:44] <terry-n43> hi.... Jimmy Barr was in the seat for most of the flight, but I'm here now
[GMT 09/22/05 20:46:56] <terry-n43> is lf data & 1hz data flowing?
[GMT 09/22/05 20:47:15] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> 1Hz yes.  LF no.
[GMT 09/22/05 20:47:21] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, BradSmull-NRL : Shuyi and Deanna are going to replace you on NRL tomorrow. Deanna is driving up with Melicie who is flying on 42 tomorrow. Jaasmine should ride back with Wei Zhao who is on 43 today.
[GMT 09/22/05 20:47:58] <GregStossmeister-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, ETA to Tampa?
[GMT 09/22/05 20:48:05] <BradSmull-NRL> Bob--we copy

[GMT 09/22/05 20:48:49] <BradSmull-NRL> Bob--have you spoken to McFadden about getting me a seat on 43 tomorrow? Preferably one close to Dave Jorgensen
[GMT 09/22/05 20:49:57] <GregStossmeister-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, Thanks Dave.
[GMT 09/22/05 20:50:23] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, we've been unable to reach jimm today. Jim Moore is going to try calling him again.
[GMT 09/22/05 20:51:29] <BradSmull-NRL> OK Bob, thx

[GMT 09/22/05 20:56:51] <JimMoore> BradSmull-NRL, Regarding seat on 43-- Jim McF said to talk to Rob-  He holds the seats you have bargain for
[GMT 09/22/05 20:57:05] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Sounds like 43 will be the last one home tonight ~6:30 so suggested briefing time would bt &pm.
[GMT 09/22/05 20:57:17] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Sounds like 43 will be the last one home tonight ~6:30 so suggested briefing time would bt 7pm.
[GMT 09/22/05 20:57:22] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Ops - our last center fix at 2043Z 25.83N 89.42W central pressure 911.4 (dropsonde)
[GMT 09/22/05 20:57:39] <terry-n43> our F/D is currently usung the inmarsat phone, when he gets off I'll restart lf
[GMT 09/22/05 20:57:52] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> terry-n43, thanks for the info
[GMT 09/22/05 20:58:25] <JimMoore> DaveJorgensen-n43,  What about max winds in the EW?
[GMT 09/22/05 20:58:31] <terry-n43> glad to be back... it felt wierd all day being off xchat, etc...
[GMT 09/22/05 20:58:38] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Ops - definately double eye structure max FL winds NE quad outer wall 121 knots 125 knots inner wall
[GMT 09/22/05 20:59:30] <DaveJorgensen-n43> eyes are very well defined on LF - inner eye open to S 
[GMT 09/22/05 21:00:01] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Also, dropsonde in moat region on SW side has very impressive dry layer nearly to the sfc
[GMT 09/22/05 21:00:44] <JimMoore> DaveJorgensen-n43, Double eyewall feature is dramatic on 42 LF
[GMT 09/22/05 21:01:05] <BradSmull-NRL> Wow Dave---doesn't sound like Rita has weakened much
[GMT 09/22/05 21:01:17] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Yes, Jim I would expect that since they're lower
[GMT 09/22/05 21:01:50] <DaveJorgensen-n43> not much weakening Brad, but as outer eye takes over I would think it would rise dramatically maybe 20 mb or so
[GMT 09/22/05 21:02:02] <DaveJorgensen-n43> then deepening again as the outer eye contracts
[GMT 09/22/05 21:02:06] <JimMoore> BradSmull-NRL, OK, only cells of interest arch (as in an outer band) from north of your position through SE. 
[GMT 09/22/05 21:02:11] <BradSmull-NRL> Ops - Is NHC 5pm discussion out yet? We're wondering about Cat 4 vs. 5 distinction
[GMT 09/22/05 21:02:39] <DaveJorgensen-n43> BradSmull-NRL, I haven't heard, may try to surf the net and see
[GMT 09/22/05 21:03:01] <BradSmull-NRL> OK Jim-- we have a visual on those out our front window--thanks
[GMT 09/22/05 21:03:01] <JimMoore> There appear to be small breaks but your nose radar will better define them
[GMT 09/22/05 21:03:51] <JimMoore> BradSmull-NRL, Beyond them there is a stratiform region back to 84.5
[GMT 09/22/05 21:04:41] <JimMoore> DaveJorgensen-n43, NHC keeps it a 4 with 145 mph and 913 mb-- latest track has landfall at TX/LA border
[GMT 09/22/05 21:05:41] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, are you getting the images ok?
[GMT 09/22/05 21:06:15] <BradSmull-NRL> Damn... poor New Orleans! At least it's a *bit* west of them
[GMT 09/22/05 21:06:39] <Jasmine-nrlp3> StacyBrodzik-Ops-- sorry, been trying to enjoy the view while it lasts.  Appears we're getting images A-OK
[GMT 09/22/05 21:07:15] <JimMoore> BradSmull-NRL, Indeed, bad news is track keeps coming east at landfall with each forecast cycle-
[GMT 09/22/05 21:07:46] <BradSmull-NRL> Jim--presumably timing of landfall is shifting earlier as well?
[GMT 09/22/05 21:08:31] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Wen-Chau, if you're there, Renee really needs to find out where you're staying in Tampa.  Media people and NCAR PR people want to get hold of you...
[GMT 09/22/05 21:08:36] <JimMoore> BradSmull-NRL, Landfall is about 3-4am central time
[GMT 09/22/05 21:09:00] <DaveJorgensen-n43> thanks Jim
[GMT 09/22/05 21:09:24] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Does 7pm sound good for a debrief for everyone? We won't wait for 42.
[GMT 09/22/05 21:09:38] <BradSmull-NRL> Still on Saturday eh Jim? A bit surprising given that the storm doesn't have nearly so far to go
[GMT 09/22/05 21:10:19] <JimMoore> BradSmull-NRL, Well it has slowed to 9 mph and official track hasn't recurved it much yet
[GMT 09/22/05 21:10:30] <BradSmull-NRL> Sounds good to us Jim. Gettng some good bumps as we thread through cells
[GMT 09/22/05 21:10:48] <JimMoore> Jasmine-nrlp3, Tell your Navy buds they did a fine job picking thru the cells
[GMT 09/22/05 21:10:56] <BradSmull-NRL> Ahhh... well so science will continue tomorrow... a good thing amidst a bad situation
[GMT 09/22/05 21:11:08] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, OK Spread the word 7pm debrief.
[GMT 09/22/05 21:11:14] <DaveJorgensen-n43> We're getting some good bumps too Brad as we go through the last band near 87.5W due E of center
[GMT 09/22/05 21:11:20] <Jasmine-nrlp3> JimMoore-- we're not done yet!  But yes, they're doing a great job.
[GMT 09/22/05 21:11:41] <GregStossmeister-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, 7pm debrief tonight please tell everyone.
[GMT 09/22/05 21:11:58] <BradSmull-NRL> Yes Dave--in general our exit has been smoother than our entry--hope same holds for you guys
[GMT 09/22/05 21:12:09] <DaveJorgensen-n43> OK will do Greg, we just finished out last end point, now RTB officially
[GMT 09/22/05 21:13:08] <GregStossmeister-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, You still seem awefully far out from Tampa can you confirm you'll be on the ground by 6:30?
[GMT 09/22/05 21:13:10] <JimMoore> Jasmine-nrlp3, Should be some stratiform now for 100 miles or so
[GMT 09/22/05 21:13:13] <BradSmull-NRL> ChrisBurghart-Boulder, I stay in Residence Inn, Westshore, Tampa.  I will be back tonigh

[GMT 09/22/05 21:14:43] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> WenChau: thx.  I'll pass the info to Renee.
[GMT 09/22/05 21:15:04] <JimMoore> Jasmine-nrlp3, Don't let the aircraft get too far north --  more mess up that way
[GMT 09/22/05 21:15:15] <GregStossmeister-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, OK - I don't believe it but I'll take your word for it.
[GMT 09/22/05 21:15:19] <WenChau> ChrisBurghart-Boulder, I will have a mission tomorrow morning ~10:30 takeoff. I will be on the plane one hour before takeoff.
[GMT 09/22/05 21:15:35] <Jasmine-nrlp3> JimMoore-- ok, thanks for keeping an eye on us
[GMT 09/22/05 21:15:48] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Greg, we may pick up some more airspeed as we climb so ETA may be shaved a bit
[GMT 09/22/05 21:16:00] <DaveJorgensen-n43> I'll keep you updated Greg as we mosey on home
[GMT 09/22/05 21:16:02] <ShuyiChen-opc> Brad & Dave,  the distinction between Cat 5 and 4 is 136 kts vs 135 kts!
[GMT 09/22/05 21:16:25] <JimMoore> Jasmine-nrlp3, Next cells at centered at 27/84 but that is south of suggested track
[GMT 09/22/05 21:16:40] <ShuyiChen-opc> NHC has Rita as a Cat 4 now and keep it as Cat 4 until landfall.

[GMT 09/22/05 22:38:10] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Yes, still here.

[GMT 09/22/05 22:38:52] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> OK, looks like I did my final boneheaded thing for the day . . . we stopped getting 42 1hz data for awhile so i thought I applied the kludge
[GMT 09/22/05 22:39:22] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> I saw the kluge there and undid it, since 1Hz wasn't flowing.
[GMT 09/22/05 22:39:46] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> so where's the noaa_42 dir?? i just made an empty one
[GMT 09/22/05 22:41:09] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> i have all of the noaa_42 data on backup up to but not including today and can put that back in there
[GMT 09/22/05 22:41:28] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Oops, I misspoke.  Kluge is in place because no 1Hz is coming in.  I moved noaa_42 to noaa_42.real this time.  Just to confuse you.. :-)
[GMT 09/22/05 22:41:38] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Sorry.
[GMT 09/22/05 22:41:44] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> thank god!!!!
[GMT 09/22/05 22:41:49] <pchang_n42> 1hz data should be coming now
[GMT 09/22/05 22:42:13] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> ok all the kludge and unkludge is yours for the rest of today :-)
[GMT 09/22/05 22:42:46] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> I guess I'll unkluge and leave it that way if 42's 1Hz is coming in.  Just a sec.
[GMT 09/22/05 22:44:01] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> where'd noaa_42.real go??
[GMT 09/22/05 22:44:32] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> I removed your empty noaa_42 and moved noaa_42.real to noaa_42
[GMT 09/22/05 22:45:06] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> i think we crossed wires again because I still show a link
[GMT 09/22/05 22:46:12] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> I just looked and you're right.  I ended up just moving noaa_42.real into the LF directory...  I'll fix *that* now.

[GMT 09/22/05 22:52:47] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> ok chris -- it's all yours....   
[GMT 09/22/05 22:53:22] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Thanks for catching my directory/link screw-up.  I would have missed it.
[GMT 09/22/05 22:54:15] <mblack> JohnGamache-hrd, we did 2 Doppler legs but  communications have been out all day 
[GMT 09/22/05 23:00:36] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> ChrisBurghart-Boulder, no problem; I was just glad we got it all back together; I'm listening to the brief now and then heading home; see you tomorrow
[GMT 09/22/05 23:02:18] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> StacyBrodzik-Ops: I assume they're flying tomorrow.  I'll be flying myself tomorrow morning, in our new Gulfstream V.  I'll probably chat from there.
