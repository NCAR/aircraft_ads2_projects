[08/17/05 20:25:15] <anstett-tampa> yes I'm here.
[08/17/05 20:26:25] <ChrisBurghart-ops> I'm just surprised that there were 9 images available.  I have a process running that should get rid of images older than ~30 minutes, and I've only put one image in the queue today.

[08/17/05 20:27:41] <anstett-tampa> I just used pqmon to tell me how many products were in the q.  Before it connected to rainex3 there were 15 images in the q, now there are 25 images.  I'll see if I can find out what they are.

[08/17/05 21:01:56] <ChrisBurghart-ops> science3-nrlp3: Sorry, I was away for a bit.  The clouds you see offshore near Tampa in the image had no associated precip in NWS radar, so it makes sense that the only radar echo you see is ground clutter.

[08/17/05 21:16:41] <science3-nrlp3> but i think we can try

[08/17/05 21:30:17] <science3-nrlp3> and science2 is having issues getting back into chat
[08/17/05 21:30:57] <science3-nrlp3> science2 is the communications station
[08/17/05 21:32:53] <science3-nrlp3> we received the image at 21:28, sent at 21:17 correct?
[08/17/05 21:33:21] <science3-nrlp3> scratch that...the clock on this station is messed up
[08/17/05 21:33:28] <science3-nrlp3> but it was 11 minutes
[08/17/05 21:34:05] <ChrisBurghart-ops> Yep, 11 minutes from 21:17 to 21:28
