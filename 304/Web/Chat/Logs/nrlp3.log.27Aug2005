[GMT 08/27/05 17:00:05] <Jasmine-ops> this is similar (albeit north) of the previous pass.  There are cells just offshore of Naples, and we are getting you between those cells and the outermost rainband
[GMT 08/27/05 17:00:40] <Jasmine-ops> the strongest cells in the rainband are south of 25.5N and east of 82W
[GMT 08/27/05 17:01:24] <Jasmine-ops> We'll keep an eye out to see if we should change any waypoints along your journey, and adjust track as needed
[GMT 08/27/05 17:01:59] <Deanna-nrlp3> thanks much ma'am
[GMT 08/27/05 17:02:46] <Jasmine-ops> Some of the rainband cells are not translating as far to the west as the rest of the precip, so make sure and keep them to your right
[GMT 08/27/05 17:03:25] <Jasmine-ops> deanna--confirm that you guys don't have plans to drop any sondes on this pass
[GMT 08/27/05 17:04:28] <Deanna-nrlp3> yes, the order has been passed to cease sondes
[GMT 08/27/05 17:04:50] <Jasmine-ops> excellent, thanks!
[GMT 08/27/05 17:05:18] <Cai-NRLp3> a total of 9 soudes have been dropped

[GMT 08/27/05 17:14:57] <JimMoore-ops> DOn't hesitate to adjust track if cells are getting too close.
[GMT 08/27/05 17:15:37] <JimMoore-ops> Your track should bring you east of stronger convection and west of weaker cells near land

[GMT 08/27/05 17:36:50] <Jasmine-ops> those cells to the left of were right on top of an old way point

[GMT 08/27/05 17:41:15] <Jasmine-ops> may have to adjust in a while to plan meeting up with 43, but this will at least keep you safe

[GMT 08/27/05 17:53:04] <Jasmine-ops> sorry, could barely see that on radar
[GMT 08/27/05 17:53:21] <Cai-nrlp3> The southern limit is ~23.5N for NRL
[GMT 08/27/05 17:54:26] <Deanna-nrlp3> no worries, but be advised that the furthest south we can go is 23.5N
[GMT 08/27/05 17:54:46] <Deanna-nrlp3> ah, there we go
[GMT 08/27/05 17:56:29] <Deanna-nrlp3> we're turning for our next point, but having to adjust to avoid a cell
[GMT 08/27/05 17:56:32] <Jasmine-ops> after 24N/81.75 waypoint, just head south on that longitude and turn around before you reach 23.5/81.75
[GMT 08/27/05 17:56:49] <Jasmine-ops> sorry, learning as we go
[GMT 08/27/05 17:57:06] <Deanna-nrlp3> no worries :)
[GMT 08/27/05 17:57:50] <Deanna-nrlp3> how does this match up with meeting up with 43?
[GMT 08/27/05 17:58:15] <Jasmine-ops> that's just a trajectory for now in a safe zone, we'll get you those waypoints once we know when 43 will be in place
[GMT 08/27/05 17:58:29] <Deanna-nrlp3> gotcha
[GMT 08/27/05 17:59:22] <Deanna-nrlp3> we're having to modify a bit as well due to the current trajectory takes us too close to key west's airport
[GMT 08/27/05 17:59:40] <Jasmine-ops> Ok, waypoints to meet up with N43 are: 24N/82.5W, 25N/83W, 25.5N/84W, 25.7N/85W
[GMT 08/27/05 18:00:04] <Cai-nrlp3> NRL will go to 23.5N/82W to avoid Key West airport
[GMT 08/27/05 18:00:08] <Jasmine-ops> give you a time in a second, sometime just after 1833

[GMT 08/27/05 18:20:35] <Deanna-nrlp3> what should our ETAs be?
[GMT 08/27/05 18:21:35] <Jasmine-ops> you don't have to be extremely precise on this pass
[GMT 08/27/05 18:21:44] <Deanna-nrlp3> for the last two legs, each should be 10-15mins according to our nav
[GMT 08/27/05 18:22:03] <Deanna-nrlp3> so just do the best we can, in other words?
[GMT 08/27/05 18:22:03] <Jasmine-ops> we're not doing quad-doppler, so keep to what you need

[GMT 08/27/05 18:59:01] <Jasmine-ops> how's it going up there?
[GMT 08/27/05 18:59:09] <Jasmine-ops> is the crew ok with our nav so far?
[GMT 08/27/05 19:00:01] <Deanna-nrlp3> i think so, we're doing great up here
[GMT 08/27/05 19:00:01] <Deanna-nrlp3> really really minor bumps
[GMT 08/27/05 19:00:01] <Deanna-nrlp3> but i guess we're in the rain now
[GMT 08/27/05 19:01:10] <Jasmine-ops> yes, strong cells appear to your W, just so you know, ~40 dbz
[GMT 08/27/05 19:01:11] <Deanna-nrlp3> our nav's doing awesome, he hasn't had any complaints so far except for the cuba thing...and that was easily fixable
[GMT 08/27/05 19:02:02] <Jasmine-ops> good to hear!
[GMT 08/27/05 19:02:30] <Deanna-nrlp3> can you give a rough location of those cells?
[GMT 08/27/05 19:03:00] <Jasmine-ops> 84/25.5
[GMT 08/27/05 19:03:11] <Jasmine-ops> basically right out your left hand window
[GMT 08/27/05 19:03:41] <Jasmine-ops> current heading should squeek you by
[GMT 08/27/05 19:04:49] <Jasmine-ops> maybe adjust slightly north if you need, 43 is out of pattern now
[GMT 08/27/05 19:05:12] <Deanna-nrlp3> can't see anything, too cloudy/rainy
[GMT 08/27/05 19:06:18] <Jasmine-ops> ok, might just want to pass along a slightly more northern trajectory to avoid anything too heavy
[GMT 08/27/05 19:06:53] <Jasmine-ops> ...if necessary
[GMT 08/27/05 19:07:48] <Jasmine-ops> by the looks on Zeb, you should be just about out of it
[GMT 08/27/05 19:07:54] <Deanna-nrlp3> i think they'll figure it out
[GMT 08/27/05 19:08:22] <Jasmine-ops> ok
[GMT 08/27/05 19:08:58] <Deanna-nrlp3> this last image looks nice :)
[GMT 08/27/05 19:09:16] <Jasmine-ops> stacy is glad you're happy.

[GMT 08/27/05 19:21:13] <houze__> deanna: you could shift your current track 0.3 deg norht if that woud be more comfortable
[GMT 08/27/05 19:23:20] <Deanna-nrlp3> i think we're good for now, considering we're a tiny bit north of the track anyway...but i gave the nav the heads up
[GMT 08/27/05 19:23:55] <Deanna-nrlp3> is there reason for concern?
[GMT 08/27/05 19:24:31] <Jasmine-ops> you're heading back into the heavier precip that you punched out of not too long ago
[GMT 08/27/05 19:25:06] <Jasmine-ops> your current heading has you going more directly through it than you did before
[GMT 08/27/05 19:25:31] <Jasmine-ops> dbz values of f~35-37
[GMT 08/27/05 19:26:09] <Deanna-nrlp3> can we get a weather update at mcdill?
[GMT 08/27/05 19:26:38] <Jasmine-ops> going even 0.1 degree N will get you out of it
[GMT 08/27/05 19:26:41] <Jasmine-ops> stand by
[GMT 08/27/05 19:26:47] <Jasmine-ops> ...on weather update at McDill
[GMT 08/27/05 19:28:25] <Deanna-nrlp3> ok, i guess they're handling it in &rianex
[GMT 08/27/05 19:30:33] <Deanna-nrlp3> track has been shifted .1 degree north to avoid the precip
[GMT 08/27/05 19:30:42] <Deanna-nrlp3> thanks jas
[GMT 08/27/05 19:31:42] <Jasmine-ops> ok, hope the flight is smoother.  the rest of the trajectory looks similar

[GMT 08/27/05 19:50:32] <MikeDaniels-home> Can someone ask Tim Lim to get on chat in &dropsonde -- thanks.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:50:41] <MikeDaniels-home> he's on the nrlp3

[GMT 08/27/05 19:58:24] <Jasmine-ops> Deanna--you will want to shift your next point to the east to 24N/82.2W
[GMT 08/27/05 19:58:39] <Jasmine-ops> some of that convection is spiraling to the old waypoint
[GMT 08/27/05 19:59:22] <Jasmine-ops> this will be the last point, you can then reverse track.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:59:38] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Jasmine--are you routinely animating our LF's in a way that allows you to track/gauge echo motion?
[GMT 08/27/05 20:00:41] <Jasmine-ops> I've been looking at the 88D radar to coordinate with NRL, haven't done much with your LF data as of yet
[GMT 08/27/05 20:00:49] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Peak FL winds this pass 40m/s

[GMT 08/27/05 20:02:38] <Jasmine-ops> after your turnaround at 24N/82.2W, you will head straight north to 25N/82.2W
[GMT 08/27/05 20:02:44] <Jasmine-ops> that's point #2
[GMT 08/27/05 20:03:48] BradSmull-n43 (smull@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &NRLP3.
[GMT 08/27/05 20:04:13] <BradSmull-n43> Sorry Jasmine, missed your response. Will just talk to you in MIA
[GMT 08/27/05 20:04:24] <Jasmine-ops> points 3&4 are: 25.7/83  26.3/84.4
[GMT 08/27/05 20:04:32] <Jasmine-ops> 4 is your last point, you can then return to Tampa
[GMT 08/27/05 20:08:02] <Jasmine-ops> so to have them all in one place:  24N/82.2W, 25N/82.2W, 25.7N/83W, 26.3N/84.4W, then return home
[GMT 08/27/05 20:08:10] <Deanna-nrlp3> gotcha, thanks! :)

[GMT 08/27/05 20:39:27] <BradSmull-n43rf> Nav calls N43's ETA at MCF  2130, though I suspect we may improve on that a bit
