[GMT 08/29/05 00:23:08] <BradSmull-n43rf> That would be welcome, Bob--it's been a long day for all of us--both Ops and Air. Is Stacy OK with that?
[GMT 08/29/05 00:23:25] <BradSmull-n43rf> (Long but *extremely* productive)
[GMT 08/29/05 00:23:32] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> Brad: I'm good with that.  Just let me know once the transfer is made
[GMT 08/29/05 00:24:19] <BobHouze-Ops> brad: I hope you saw my earlier comment on the overall success of the mission

[GMT 08/29/05 00:26:39] <BradSmull-n43rf> OK Stacy--thanks
[GMT 08/29/05 00:26:43] <N43-Sta2> nope we're good -- thanks
[GMT 08/29/05 00:26:53] <N43-Sta2> have a great evening and we'll talk tomorrow at 11 AM

[GMT 08/29/05 00:28:19] <BradSmull-n43rf> Yes Bob, very successful in hindsight. But major deviations from the ops plan cause stress up here. Let's debrief privately, ok?
[GMT 08/29/05 00:29:13] <BradSmull-n43rf> These outer bands are ROUGH
[GMT 08/29/05 00:29:26] <BradSmull-n43rf> We just had our biggest bump of the day
[GMT 08/29/05 00:29:52] <GregStossmeister-ops> How big?
[GMT 08/29/05 00:30:17] <Rob-N43> 9 m/s updraft
[GMT 08/29/05 00:31:04] <GregStossmeister-ops> That's just Katrina saying goodnight.
[GMT 08/29/05 00:31:22] <Rob-N43> a goodnight kiss....
[GMT 08/29/05 00:32:43] <BradSmull-n43rf> Greg- When I said *biggest* I should have said *sharpest*
[GMT 08/29/05 00:32:53] <BradSmull-n43rf> 12 m/s can be relatively smooth if you ramp up/down slowly....
[GMT 08/29/05 00:32:57] <BradSmull-n43rf> and we saw 12 earlier

[GMT 08/29/05 00:40:37] <GregStossmeister-ops> Brad - I know what you mean quick ups and down are more painful than the gradual rise and fall.
[GMT 08/29/05 00:41:15] <BradSmull-n43rf> Exactly. Btw, welcome Greg!!!!!  Wanted to say that earlier, but it's been a *bit* busy up here...
[GMT 08/29/05 00:42:17] <GregStossmeister-ops> Brad - Thanks very much - I understand you had other things on your mind today.
[GMT 08/29/05 00:42:36] <BradSmull-n43rf> Yep, but we got it done, and NRL got home safe. Those were my main concerns.
[GMT 08/29/05 00:43:18] <GregStossmeister-ops> Brad: They collected some fantastic data even though it was somewhat unexpected.
[GMT 08/29/05 00:43:55] <GregStossmeister-ops> Brad - Maybe unplanned would be a better word.
[GMT 08/29/05 00:44:01] <BradSmull-n43rf> Great!!!!  There's still room for serendipity. It's just that when, with no prior announcement, my Nav gave me a location for NRL that was *INSIDE* the rainband, I felt like I was in a nightmare
[GMT 08/29/05 00:44:48] <BradSmull-n43rf> Since that was exacdtly where we had all agreed prior we wouldn't put them. But this can come up in debrief. This case worked fine, for which I'm grateful, but my concern now is about future operations.
[GMT 08/29/05 00:45:02] <GregStossmeister-ops> Yep - we have the advantage of seeing the tracks and the radar together
[GMT 08/29/05 00:45:53] <GregStossmeister-ops> You know how it is when you are following a feature and something else develops next to you - that's pretty much what happenned.
[GMT 08/29/05 00:45:53] <BradSmull-n43rf> Ahhhh, there WAS no radar for NRL's initial crossing of the rainband--that's my point
[GMT 08/29/05 00:47:18] <GregStossmeister-ops> I'm sure we'll talk in great detail about it tomorrow.

We realized the situation about the same time as you. We also realized that they had a clear path. We knew from the get go that we might have to be creatgive when we finally saw what was out there. You weere required to go out over 100 nm. So we thought you could pick them up with you on the outsi
[GMT 08/29/05 00:58:56] <houze_ops> de. this happened too fast to give you a heads up. We also didn't realize gthat we were expectedt o guide them from here. We thought you would pick them up. Alls well that ends well
