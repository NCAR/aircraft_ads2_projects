[GMT 09/08/05 15:49:24] <ads-nrlp3> Okay.  It camw up pretty quickly.  We shutdown the ACtracker program and brought it up from the start.
[GMT 09/08/05 15:50:20] <anstett-jeffco> You can just hit stop, wait a minute or so, then hit start instead of closing ACtracker window.
[GMT 09/08/05 16:24:19] <ads-nrlp3> Janet, we are going to want to run the system until 1430 our time.  I'm hoping you will be done by then.
[GMT 09/08/05 16:25:18] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Janet, are you still looking at LDM issues?  Is there anything I can help with?
[GMT 09/08/05 16:29:27] <anstett-jeffco> Chris, On reestablishing the satcomm link on the NRL, I'm stopping the LDM for two minutes to allow chat to reconnect faster.  I'm also looking at issues on malbec with expiring of images.  It appears that the pqexpire command does not work correctly when put in the config file.  If I run the same command from the command line, then it works.  The process does show up in the process list, but doesn't really appear to run.
[GMT 09/08/05 16:30:24] <anstett-jeffco> ads - I will be done with the link shortly.  I'll let you know when I'm logged off the link.
[GMT 09/08/05 16:30:30] ads-nrlp3 (ads@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Ping timeout
[GMT 09/08/05 16:33:32] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> It almost looks like pqexpire (in the check-on-a-regular-basis mode) doesn't remove anything.  I'm going to send email to Unidata and ask if they know what pqexpire *really* does.
[GMT 09/08/05 16:35:50] <anstett-jeffco> When I checked malbec yesterday, there were over 1000 products in the queue.  I restarted the ldm and pqexpire was running, but it only expired the images when I ran pqexpire from the command line.  The queue went from over 1000 images to 2!  It appears that pqexpire does work in a check-on-a-regular-basis mode but just not from the config file for some reason.
[GMT 09/08/05 16:37:22] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> So when you start pqexpire by hand, it cleans the queue of old images and continues to keep it clean, or just cleans things once when you first start it?
[GMT 09/08/05 16:38:18] <anstett-jeffco> I think it was keeping the queue clean, but I'll have to check that again to make sure.  I'll start it again on malbec and let you know.
[GMT 09/08/05 16:40:12] <anstett-jeffco> I just started it on malbec from the command line and know there are 5 products in the queue, 4 data files and 1 composite image.

[GMT 09/08/05 20:05:38] <anstett-jeffco> Can you do the following in a terminal window: ps -ef | grep ldm   Tell me if you see any ldm processes running.
[GMT 09/08/05 20:06:46] <anstett-jeffco> Actually the LDM is running because I just saw that it connected to malbec here.
[GMT 09/08/05 20:09:40] <ads-nrlp3> tHERE ARE A BUNCH OF LDM PROCESSES RUNNING.
[GMT 09/08/05 20:10:17] <anstett-jeffco> If I can't get back in before you shut down, then we'll just go with it as it is now.
[GMT 09/08/05 20:10:30] <ads-nrlp3> It looks like there are 6 ldm precesses running.
[GMT 09/08/05 20:10:51] <anstett-jeffco> That's good.
[GMT 09/08/05 20:12:06] <ads-nrlp3> OK, it seems to be working.  We have about 15 minutes before I need to shutdown,
[GMT 09/08/05 20:14:54] <anstett-jeffco> Try this:  grep "Starting" ~ldm/logs/ldmd.log     I just need to know the times in the last couple of lines that show up.
