[GMT 08/28/05 17:15:41] <houze_ops> Brad & Rob: Wen & I have discussed the option of both planes working the outside of the rainband. We think it would work best as follows: When 43 gets to E point of W-E leg of 2nd fig 4 line up outside rainband and fly downwind. NRL will follow same track in trail separated ~70 nm behind 43. When 43 has flown 140 nm, both a/c reverse track. Both a/c keep flying reverse tracks outside band as time allows. Understood? 
[GMT 08/28/05 17:15:46] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Stacy & Bob - Succeeded in scp'ing a Zebra image, so that should work.

[GMT 08/28/05 17:36:58] <BobHouze-Ops> Brad & Rob:  After the first coordination with NRL in the NE sector, can you rotate the next set of fig 4s counterclockwise by 45 degrees, so that instead of N-to-S you go NW-to-SE?  This would allow a second coordination with NR in the SE sector.
[GMT 08/28/05 17:36:59] <n43_RAMS> is lf getting through?
[GMT 08/28/05 17:37:11] <Jasmine-ops> yes, LF is getting here!!
[GMT 08/28/05 17:37:17] <BradSmull-NOAA43> LF shows only one more (minor) band between present location (26deg 48min  87deg 59min) and eyewall. Eyewall appearance remains closed and perfectly circular

[GMT 08/28/05 17:39:08] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Bob - Barry sounds lukewarm, but the idea is planted. Let us get through this first pass and we'll know better what we're dealing with.
[GMT 08/28/05 17:39:18] <Rob> Barry (FD) says he is open to the idea...it will depend on the conditions as we're out here and what CARCAH says

[GMT 08/28/05 17:50:16] <ShuyiChen-opc> R & B, we're seeing them on floator img
[GMT 08/28/05 17:50:16] <N43-Rob> can see some evidence of clouds roping in from eyewall
[GMT 08/28/05 17:50:57] <BobHouze-Ops> On high res sat it looks basically like you have described it. Can even see the low broken clouds
[GMT 08/28/05 17:51:09] <N43-Rob> yes
[GMT 08/28/05 17:51:16] <N43-Rob> any evidence of mesovortices?

[GMT 08/28/05 18:03:44] <marks_> Rob How was the pass through? Was Brad seeing what Sim talked about in teh conference call?
[GMT 08/28/05 18:04:14] <N43-Rob> he may have been
[GMT 08/28/05 18:04:21] <BradSmull-NOAA43> I didn't notice any marked convective-scsale structure Frank, but let's await John G.'s analysis
[GMT 08/28/05 18:04:34] <N43-Rob> there was spiraling clouds like he mentioned
[GMT 08/28/05 18:04:48] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Yes--corkscrewing tower on W side was kinda notable
[GMT 08/28/05 18:04:53] <N43-Rob> i asked barry before flight if we could target features like that and he said no
[GMT 08/28/05 18:05:02] <BradSmull-NOAA43> But that was visual--not anything I could pick-out on radar
[GMT 08/28/05 18:05:11] <BradSmull-NOAA43> THANK YOU BARRY
[GMT 08/28/05 18:05:34] <N43-Rob> john was going to try to do an analysis after each pass and send it on each successive downwind leg
[GMT 08/28/05 18:06:00] <BradSmull-NOAA43> John is a very busy guy with all the sondes he's got to send... ideally we need more staff up here

[GMT 08/28/05 18:24:36] <BradSmull-n43> This downwind/e-bound run is going to graze/tangent to a fairly intense outer rainband
[GMT 08/28/05 18:25:17] <BobHouze-Ops> brad: would it be good to scan one side with the tail?
[GMT 08/28/05 18:29:21] <BradSmull-n43> Bob... Rob and I discussed this before, and we're in agreement that the cost/benefit ratio isn't too favorable. We've got good echo (and hence circulation) on both sides of track since this track crossed the band
[GMT 08/28/05 18:30:07] <BradSmull-n43> So if one scans one side only, the question is when to switch.  In supercells I have no problem, but here I think 'KISS' applies....
[GMT 08/28/05 18:31:02] <BradSmull-n43> Sorry - know my previous comment about "tangent track" was misleading. We have indeed crossed this band, tho obliquely
[GMT 08/28/05 18:32:54] <BobHouze-Ops> brad: Ok on the 2 sides. It was just a suggestion.

[GMT 08/28/05 18:39:56] <BradSmull-n43> Bob - FD is reluctant to do any "upwind" work w/ 43 as required for reciproocal passes. There are other things we *might* be able to do to get creative, since we have option to cross eye region.

[GMT 08/28/05 21:51:00] <BradSmull-NOAA43> This is why we need to debrief putting them on W side.
[GMT 08/28/05 21:51:07] <BobHouze-Ops> so they should be ok from here on
[GMT 08/28/05 21:51:17] <BradSmull-NOAA43> If you say so--that's great.
[GMT 08/28/05 21:52:00] <BradSmull-NOAA43> John Gamache keeps warning me to be wary of highly convective outer-most bands, so that's my underlying concern

[GMT 08/28/05 21:53:52] <BobHouze-Ops> brad if you have voice contact with nrl, they can start heading to their 28.4/89 point any time now
[GMT 08/28/05 21:54:21] <BradSmull-NOAA43> OK -waiting for answer to previous question when you can please
[GMT 08/28/05 21:55:10] <BobHouze-Ops> Brad: if possible it would be better to wait a little longer till we get them headed east
[GMT 08/28/05 21:55:55] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> Brad: with the nrl comm drop, we don't have a position on them since 2146
[GMT 08/28/05 21:56:36] <BobHouze-Ops> brad: we are sending them back down your track we should keep them in a smooth pattern'
[GMT 08/28/05 21:57:17] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Bob, we're out of time. Wen says he's comfortable.

[GMT 08/28/05 23:13:21] <BobHouze-Ops> NRL & N43: Overall this has been a very good mission from a science perspective. You got Doppler data in rainbands on the southeast, east, northeast, and north sides of the system. We got dropsondes all along the rainbands and N43 got dense sonde coverage in the eyewall region. This is exactly the type of data we are trying to obtain. The rainbands we sampled were undergoing rapid evolution. So this data set combined with yesterday's should be opt
[GMT 08/28/05 23:13:21] <BobHouze-Ops> imal for use in connection with the model. Good work on both planes, and at the ops center.
[GMT 08/28/05 23:13:21] <JimMoore-ops> So question here is are there photos of this eye.  We are watching hi res loop of the eye ,  Wow!

[GMT 08/28/05 23:19:01] <Deanna-nrlp3> last sonde was away at 22:42, radar shut down at 23:07
[GMT 08/28/05 23:19:02] <BobHouze-Ops> brad: we are talking about it
[GMT 08/28/05 23:19:12] <BradSmull-NOAA43> OK, thx
[GMT 08/28/05 23:20:17] <Deanna-nrlp3> 16 sondes were dropped in total
[GMT 08/28/05 23:20:38] <BobHouze-Ops> brad: maybe you could have a 43 debrief post flight, and you can bring their comments to the 11 am debrief tomorrow
[GMT 08/28/05 23:21:41] <BradSmull-NOAA43> A real debrief is interactive. What you're proposing is a report. Your decision.
[GMT 08/28/05 23:22:13] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Eyewall is electrified this pass.
[GMT 08/28/05 23:22:28] <Rob-N43> appears open on SW side too
[GMT 08/28/05 23:22:41] <Deanna-nrlp3> oh, and despite the iridup being down for 12 minutes, chat was down for 38 minutes
[GMT 08/28/05 23:23:00] <ShuyiChen-opc> Rob, we saw the open on the 88D as well.
[GMT 08/28/05 23:23:07] <Rob-N43> ok
[GMT 08/28/05 23:23:11] <Deanna-nrlp3> despite the *iridium being down...
[GMT 08/28/05 23:23:40] <Deanna-nrlp3> ops, is tomorrow a down day for NRL?
[GMT 08/28/05 23:24:57] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Ansel Adams never imagined this:  Sunset over Eyewall
[GMT 08/28/05 23:25:00] <Jasmine_ops> Deanna--stand by, they're figuring out about the debrief right now.  I'll make sure they answer
[GMT 08/28/05 23:25:29] <BradSmull-NOAA43> But he should have... it's breathtaking
[GMT 08/28/05 23:25:44] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Bob: At least some of our flight deck crew says they could be present tomorrow at 11. 
[GMT 08/28/05 23:26:17] <BobHouze-Ops> brad: Great, we will do it at 11 am tomorrow.
[GMT 08/28/05 23:26:32] <Deanna-nrlp3> hope you got a great picture!
[GMT 08/28/05 23:26:37] <Rob-N43> amazing view out the left window here
[GMT 08/28/05 23:26:47] <Deanna-nrlp3> debrief is at 11am tomorrow morning, correct?
[GMT 08/28/05 23:26:58] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> Deanna, that is correct
[GMT 08/28/05 23:27:13] <Deanna-nrlp3> answer in regards to down day for NRL tomorrow?
[GMT 08/28/05 23:27:14] <BobHouze-Ops> Deanna: Tomorrow should absolutely be a down day for NRL and related EOL
[GMT 08/28/05 23:27:32] <Rob-N43> and the wind center fixes are not aligned what the low-level clouds would suggest
[GMT 08/28/05 23:27:39] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Is NRL flight deck crew available for debrief tomorrow?
[GMT 08/28/05 23:28:06] <BobHouze-Ops> brad et al: anyone can call into the 11 am debrief & briefing
[GMT 08/28/05 23:31:14] <Deanna-nrlp3> i asked the nav...he said they should be able to call in tomorrow for the debrief
[GMT 08/28/05 23:31:27] <BobHouze-Ops> deanna: thanks

[GMT 08/28/05 23:36:09] <BobHouze-Ops> deanna: how was the ride across the band at 86 west?
[GMT 08/28/05 23:36:15] <BobHouze-Ops> any bumps there?
[GMT 08/28/05 23:37:15] <Deanna-nrlp3> no, we were fine....very very minor at best
[GMT 08/28/05 23:37:39] <JimMoore-ops> Brad, IS it dark in the eye now?  any lightning? and is this your last fix?
[GMT 08/28/05 23:37:43] <BobHouze-Ops> deanna: good, that's what I expected

[GMT 08/28/05 23:38:16] <Deanna-nrlp3> we did spend a bit of time in the boundary layer for a bit, flying at about 1000ft....that was kinda fun :)
[GMT 08/28/05 23:38:56] <BobHouze-Ops> deanna: what part of the flight are you talking about?
[GMT 08/28/05 23:39:36] <Deanna-nrlp3> around 22:53 we were flying at 1000ft for a ways
[GMT 08/28/05 23:39:41] <Deanna-nrlp3> during the ferry
[GMT 08/28/05 23:39:51] <BobHouze-Ops> ok

[GMT 08/28/05 23:41:50] <terry_n43> is lf data back?
[GMT 08/28/05 23:41:56] <Jasmine_ops> LF is back
[GMT 08/28/05 23:42:00] <Jasmine_ops> Thanks Terry
[GMT 08/28/05 23:42:03] <terry_n43> thnx
[GMT 08/28/05 23:42:16] <Rob-N43> ok i typed this earlier but it didn't get through
[GMT 08/28/05 23:42:22] <Rob-N43> we are orbiting in the eye now
[GMT 08/28/05 23:42:44] <Rob-N43> we have done a complete circumnavigation -- 2 of them
[GMT 08/28/05 23:42:57] <Rob-N43> we flew as close to the inner edge of the eyewall as possible
[GMT 08/28/05 23:43:07] <Rob-N43> and flew straight and level as much as possible
[GMT 08/28/05 23:43:14] <Rob-N43> to map out the inner edge of the eyewall with the TA radar
[GMT 08/28/05 23:43:29] <Rob-N43> we have been on average about 10 km from the inner edge
[GMT 08/28/05 23:43:42] <Rob-N43> there have been multiple swirls in the low-level clouds of varying sizes
[GMT 08/28/05 23:43:49] <Deanna-nrlp3> we're preparing for landing
[GMT 08/28/05 23:43:56] <Rob-N43> the largest swirl I estimate has not been coinciding with the location of the wind center
[GMT 08/28/05 23:44:12] <Rob-N43> but it indicates a complex structure in the eye
[GMT 08/28/05 23:44:18] N42_MARS (N42_MARS@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Quit: Leaving
[GMT 08/28/05 23:44:33] <Rob-N43> are any of these features visible in the hi-res super-rapid scan imagery?
[GMT 08/28/05 23:46:03] <Deanna-nrlp3> what is the eta of n43 in tampa?
[GMT 08/28/05 23:46:27] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Deanna: We're probably about 2 hours out, maybe a bit less
[GMT 08/28/05 23:46:32] <GregStossmeister-ops> Rob-N43, Yes we see these - especially the larger elliptal swirl you mention
[GMT 08/28/05 23:46:36] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Will update you once we punch out of the eye
[GMT 08/28/05 23:46:48] <Rob-N43> ok thanks
[GMT 08/28/05 23:46:51] <Deanna-nrlp3> touchdown
[GMT 08/28/05 23:46:52] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Tracking 045 for exit
[GMT 08/28/05 23:48:11] <GregStossmeister-ops> Rob-N43, The hole in the eyewall reflectivity to the SW also is apparent in the cloud tops - they seem to have lowered in that section as well.
[GMT 08/28/05 23:48:18] <Deanna-nrlp3> mike bell is wondering if there is elevated theta e in the eye
[GMT 08/28/05 23:49:20] <Rob-N43> can't see, that's not included in our standard graphical output
[GMT 08/28/05 23:49:32] <Rob-N43> but we can obviously find out post-flight
[GMT 08/28/05 23:50:06] <Deanna-nrlp3> thanks will check it out later - bell
[GMT 08/28/05 23:50:18] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Exiting at 8kft. Max FL wind near 155 kt
[GMT 08/28/05 23:50:23] <Deanna-nrlp3> bradi:  what should we do about the data transfer issue?  can you handle it or should i wait at the nanger?
[GMT 08/28/05 23:50:27] <Deanna-nrlp3> at the *hanger
[GMT 08/28/05 23:50:42] <Rob-N43> thanks greg -- could that be reflectiing some SW shear impacting system? or something else?
[GMT 08/28/05 23:50:48] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Deanna: If you do yours, I can do ours--deal?
[GMT 08/28/05 23:51:18] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Just keep your cellphone handy in case I get bogged down, esp. with dropsonde data
[GMT 08/28/05 23:51:54] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> Deanna & Brad: Can you send me an email after you've completed your data transfer??
[GMT 08/28/05 23:52:06] <JimMoore-ops> Brad, Rob,  central pressure reading??
[GMT 08/28/05 23:52:19] <Rob-N43> extrap < 900
[GMT 08/28/05 23:52:27] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Jim: Last drop showed 904
[GMT 08/28/05 23:52:49] <Rob-N43> the extrap has been consistently low by about 5 mb
[GMT 08/28/05 23:53:10] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Tho  as Rob has pointed out, visually speaking, the wind center we located at 10 kft did not necessarily conincide with the visual center(s) of circulationin clouds below

[GMT 08/28/05 23:53:49] <GregStossmeister-ops> Rob-N43, Lower tops are only apparent in elongated ring around eyewall - doesn't look like shear really
[GMT 08/28/05 23:53:55] <Rob-N43> ok
[GMT 08/28/05 23:54:44] <JimMoore-ops> Thanks--impressions here are this is an excellent RAINEX case
[GMT 08/28/05 23:55:06] <JimMoore-ops> Please encourage anyone with comments to bring them to the conference call
[GMT 08/28/05 23:55:12] <Rob-N43> that's great especially since we did this on a NHC-tasked mission
[GMT 08/28/05 23:55:23] <JimMoore-ops> This is how we learn to do it better
[GMT 08/28/05 23:56:29] <JimMoore-ops> SO as a humorous aside, we have now TD 13 at 45W and another wave about 5 degrees off Africa
[GMT 08/28/05 23:56:41] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Sonde into S eyewall got 138 kt at height of 20 m
