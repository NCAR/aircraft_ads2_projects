[GMT 09/24/05 00:02:17] <Jasmine-ops> Deanna-nrlp3, how was that eye?
[GMT 09/24/05 00:03:09] <Deanna-nrlp3> Jasmine-ops-- it was pretty nice, the northern part was significantly more photogenice then the southern part (because there wasn't much of a southern eyewall)
[GMT 09/24/05 00:03:54] <Jasmine-ops> Deanna-nrlp3, I bet.  Did ELDORA see any inward tilt of the eyewall, or was it all pretty outward?
[GMT 09/24/05 00:05:01] <Deanna-nrlp3> Jasmine-ops-- interesting, actually...there was one part of the eyewall that was inward tilting at low levels, outward tilting at high levels
[GMT 09/24/05 00:05:14] <Deanna-nrlp3> like >
[GMT 09/24/05 00:05:17] <Jasmine-ops> Deanna-nrlp3, hmmm...just as I suspected....
[GMT 09/24/05 00:05:23] <Jasmine-ops> hey, nice graphic...  ;-)
[GMT 09/24/05 00:05:35] <Deanna-nrlp3> hehe, i thought it was pretty clever
[GMT 09/24/05 00:06:04] <Deanna-nrlp3> but yeah, the rest of the eyewall had a pretty killer outward slant, especially when we were doing that outer orbit
[GMT 09/24/05 00:06:25] <Deanna-nrlp3> the southern eyewal had some low level messy stuff
[GMT 09/24/05 00:06:54] <Jasmine-ops> sweet...gotta say, I'm jealous!
[GMT 09/24/05 00:07:05] <Jasmine-ops> but glad at least one of us got to see it
[GMT 09/24/05 00:07:50] <Deanna-nrlp3> we'll have to swap stories for sure
[GMT 09/24/05 00:08:07] <Deanna-nrlp3> you got Rita when she wasn't a big bowl of oatmeal :)
[GMT 09/24/05 00:08:24] <Jasmine-ops> I like oatmeal...yummy
