[GMT 08/25/05 14:52:13] <RRogers> I got in late to this discussion, but has there been any discussion of targets for coordination?  Are we still thinking to target the NE side?

[GMT 08/25/05 15:04:08] <BradSmull-n43> Bob --LF *may* be attenuated by it, but I don't see much evidence of anything beyond the band currently on our 100 km ring (i.e. along ~ 77.2W), at least in E quadrant
[GMT 08/25/05 15:05:14] <BobHouze-Ops> Brad: To your east it's problematic. To your north is good. A lot of the pattern is out of LF range

[GMT 08/25/05 16:11:19] <houze_ops> we have  no new info. T/O is between 1400-1430 local
[GMT 08/25/05 16:11:56] <houze_ops> that is a best estimate based on repairs
[GMT 08/25/05 16:11:57] <BradSmull-n43rf> 43's revised ETA at easternmost point is 1830 Z; suspect NRL not available that early?  Alternatively, could meet-up on N side at end of downwind leg ~1850.
[GMT 08/25/05 16:12:50] <houze_ops> ok we will think in terms of north side

[GMT 08/25/05 16:52:14] <RRogers> that'll be the last radial leg 
[GMT 08/25/05 16:52:26] <BradSmull-n43> No. We have fixes at both 18Z and 21Z, so more figure-4's will be required
[GMT 08/25/05 16:53:23] <BobHouze-Ops> ??
[GMT 08/25/05 16:53:31] <BradSmull-n43> Stand by-we're inquiring.
[GMT 08/25/05 16:53:32] <RRogers> sorry bob stand by
[GMT 08/25/05 16:56:18] <RRogers> depending on how much time is remaining before the final fix, we may do another pass that may become a figure 4
[GMT 08/25/05 16:56:33] <RRogers> i'd like to use the time before the final fix to do the rainband work with the NRL
[GMT 08/25/05 16:56:42] <RRogers> and the flight director has said we can do that
[GMT 08/25/05 16:56:56] <RRogers> we'll be east of the center at about 1830 UTC
[GMT 08/25/05 16:57:13] <RRogers> so it kind of depends on when NRL can get off and we can begin our coordination
[GMT 08/25/05 16:57:15] <BobHouze-Ops> Rob: can you keep us abreast of upcoming legs in case we are able to get nrl in the air in time to do anything?
[GMT 08/25/05 16:57:26] <RRogers> brad do you agree with that?
[GMT 08/25/05 16:57:40] <RRogers> bob -- sure
[GMT 08/25/05 16:57:47] <BobHouze-Ops> thx

[GMT 08/25/05 16:59:51] <RRogers> at the end of this leg, when we're about 80 nm SE of center, we'll then proceed north to a point E of the center

[GMT 08/25/05 17:00:14] <RRogers> at that point we should have time to begin rainband work if possible
[GMT 08/25/05 17:00:35] <RRogers> i.e. if NRL is there
[GMT 08/25/05 17:00:52] <jimm> amy word on 587?
[GMT 08/25/05 17:01:34] <jimm> all quiet on that front?
[GMT 08/25/05 17:01:49] <science2-nrlp3> It would be nice to know the window when NRL needs to be in position assuming we can fly. It looks like we MAY BE able to fly with working ELDORA in the next 2 hours. The rotodome repair is done and under testing now.

[GMT 08/25/05 17:06:45] <BradSmull-n43> To my eye, structure on NE side looks less well organized than earlier, tho may be function of our greater range

[GMT 08/25/05 17:08:37] <jimm> Something to consider - if this storm reaches hurricane strength in the Gulf, we may have to accommodate the Jeb Bush on a flight.
[GMT 08/25/05 17:08:52] <jimm> you can count on him requiring up to four seats. 
[GMT 08/25/05 17:08:54] <BradSmull-n43> Estimate arriving E of center (*approximately* 26.2 N  78.3 W ) around 1800 UTC
[GMT 08/25/05 17:09:27] <jimm> please keep this in your thoughts while flight planning RAINEX mission.  also, a penetration would be absolutely required.
[GMT 08/25/05 17:09:38] <jimm> Thoughts?
[GMT 08/25/05 17:09:38] <BobHouze-Ops> brad: my quick eyeball estimate is that what I'm seeing is a bit beyond your range and it a lot of it is over land
[GMT 08/25/05 17:10:38] <BradSmull-n43> Bob- Up until now we've been talking coordination w/ NRL in **NE** quadrant over water, correct?
[GMT 08/25/05 17:11:53] <BobHouze-Ops> yes. I'm watching the stuff to the nw because it could affect their transit across and because it is a signal that the storm continues to get more organized, to my untrained eye.
[GMT 08/25/05 17:12:32] <BradSmull-n43> Understood. Hopefully they can/will deviate N around storm as necessary on their outbound ferry.

[GMT 08/25/05 17:16:55] <BobHouze-Ops> The estimate of the point on the east side at 1800UTC--
[GMT 08/25/05 17:16:59] <RRogers> MIA 88D long-range radar shows a N-S line about 100 km E of center that may be promising
[GMT 08/25/05 17:17:12] <BobHouze-Ops> what happens after that--ANother figure 4 ??
[GMT 08/25/05 17:17:52] <BobHouze-Ops> Indeed ROb, as you see, it wraps all the way around to near
[GMT 08/25/05 17:18:15] <BobHouze-Ops> Havana--  Even Bob agrees this is a major rainband-
[GMT 08/25/05 17:18:43] <RRogers> yes it's pretty impressive

[GMT 08/25/05 17:24:54] <RRogers> some values are higher but that may be contaminated by high rain rates

[GMT 08/25/05 20:50:37] <BradSmull-n43> thanks Deanna--we were offline when that msg was sent, apparently
[GMT 08/25/05 20:51:02] <DeannaHence-tampa> yeah....jim said to give him or bob a call when you land and they'll join the call from the apartment
[GMT 08/25/05 20:51:03] <BradSmull-n43> our ETA MacDill is 5:10pm or so
[GMT 08/25/05 20:51:06] <DeannaHence-tampa> but they need to get off the keys
[GMT 08/25/05 20:51:09] <DeannaHence-tampa> ok
[GMT 08/25/05 20:51:13] <DeannaHence-tampa> see you when you land
[GMT 08/25/05 20:51:50] <BradSmull-n43> Yeppers
[GMT 08/25/05 20:55:04] <DeannaHence-tampa> i guess we'll have to pull the data off when y'all land, unless you have another file transfer method in mind?

[GMT 08/25/05 20:59:07] <BradSmull-n43> If you lead me through it, it'll help ensure that I can do it in your absence at some later date (i.e. if you get evacuated!)
[GMT 08/25/05 20:59:33] <DeannaHence-tampa> will do :)
