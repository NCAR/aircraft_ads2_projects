[GMT 09/26/05 15:35:10] <marks-hrd> Pete SED chat is not working.
[GMT 09/26/05 15:50:02] <pete-43RF> Frank- OK I'll ask Terry about it. I can see Paul C and others log on and off but no traffic.
[GMT 09/26/05 15:51:23] <pete-43RF> Just left west boundary of Loop current. Headed for eddy center, which appears from the buoys to be about a deg west of the center of our pattern.
[GMT 09/26/05 15:52:43] <pete-43RF> All 12 AXBTs working perfectly. SSTs = 28.7, MLDs in Loop Current were 90 m, west of Loop Current are now 50m.
[GMT 09/26/05 15:52:54] <marks-hrd> OK Nick is coming over after lunch to chat with you. Mark says he needs your accomplishments ASAP (he is sitting in my ffice).
[GMT 09/26/05 15:55:29] <pete-43RF> I'll take some of my play time today to work on the accomplishments.
[GMT 09/26/05 15:56:28] <pete-43RF> Terry said they have a new sed network. Instead of Camille.com, go to hotcupojava.com for sed.
[GMT 09/26/05 15:57:29] <pete-43RF> Earthquake in Peru today- major trauma for Ada this am. But Lima ok- only cracked walls. Familly ok.
[GMT 09/26/05 15:59:36] <marks-hrd> I need IP address for hotcupofjava
[GMT 09/26/05 16:00:55] <marks-hrd> also port to connect to.
[GMT 09/26/05 16:01:14] <terry-n43> marks-hrd, Hi Frank, I think you can just type in hotcupojava.com with port <Sanitized>, or the ip is <Sanitized>
[GMT 09/26/05 16:01:43] <terry-n43> password is same as the #sed channel on the camille server
[GMT 09/26/05 16:02:22] <terry-n43> ops.. the ip i just gave you is for camille... don't use 67.79..etc
[GMT 09/26/05 16:02:32] <terry-n43> just type in <Sanitized>
[GMT 09/26/05 16:02:37] <marks-hrd> Thanks Terry I will try <Sanitized>
[GMT 09/26/05 16:03:07] <pete-43RF> Its <Sanitized>
