[GMT 09/21/05 10:34:48] <BradSmull-AOC> Hi Bob--yes, we're looking at that
[GMT 09/21/05 10:35:17] <BradSmull-AOC> The short range view makes the outermost band look very intense, at least on the east side...not sure what we'll find in N quadrant (which we would approach from Tampa) though

[GMT 09/21/05 10:37:59] <BradSmull-AOC> Well, that's what we're *hoping*. But range effects are range effects.....   We're anxious to see the first fiew GOES Vis images which may give some indication of convective intensity on N/NW quadrants
[GMT 09/21/05 10:38:06] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-AOC, no need to change IP just yet. Just be aware of the structure and that we might want to change to the northern point as the IP
[GMT 09/21/05 10:38:17] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-AOC, agree re GOES

[GMT 09/21/05 13:25:10] <DaveJorgensen-N43> I'd still like to ferry west a bit on the way to the IP to get an LF look at the north and west sides
[GMT 09/21/05 13:25:51] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-N43, that's  ok but we don't want to delay NRL any more than we have to 
[GMT 09/21/05 13:26:35] <DaveJorgensen-N43> I concur
[GMT 09/21/05 13:26:48] <DaveJorgensen-N43> we won't take more than 15-20 min to do this
[GMT 09/21/05 13:27:11] <DaveJorgensen-N43> we'll probably go SW from TPA to 84.6W or so then S to IP

[GMT 09/21/05 13:30:57] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-N43, the main thing we need to get from your ferry track is knowledge of where the soft spots are for NRL to get to the IP. So we will try to have them follow your track out to the IP
[GMT 09/21/05 13:31:36] <DaveJorgensen-N43> I concur
[GMT 09/21/05 13:32:03] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-N43, at what latitude will you reach 84.6W
[GMT 09/21/05 13:32:20] <DaveJorgensen-N43> I'll let you know what the Tail radar sees as we cross the main outer band (i.e., stratiform or convective)
[GMT 09/21/05 13:32:45] <DaveJorgensen-N43> I'll have to check with the Nav for the exact outbound track - I asked for a SW track from here
[GMT 09/21/05 13:32:46] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-N43, the tail radar info will be super helpful
[GMT 09/21/05 13:33:18] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-N43, ok We   will need to give that point to NRL sometime before they take off
[GMT 09/21/05 13:33:34] <DaveJorgensen-N43> OK
[GMT 09/21/05 13:34:48] <DaveJorgensen-N43> The ferry track can sometimes be convoluted as ATC gets involved with vectoring the aircraft via VOR intersections

[GMT 09/21/05 14:38:58] <Rogers-n43> was there a 10 AM EDT TRMM overpass?  If so, have you seen it yet?
[GMT 09/21/05 14:39:30] <BobHouze-Ops> Rogers-n43, the eye seems most active on its NW-W side in vis
[GMT 09/21/05 14:39:48] <ShuyiChen-opc> Rob, the eye is shinking and outflow is expending on IR - classical intensification stage!
[GMT 09/21/05 14:40:14] <Rogers-n43> Bob&Shuyi -- yes it looks like it's about 25-30 nm diameter now
[GMT 09/21/05 14:40:16] <ShuyiChen-opc> shrinking

[GMT 09/21/05 14:40:51] <DaveJorgenen-N43> Ops - TA sweeps as we went through outer band was fairly stratiform as we avoided the higher dbz cells
[GMT 09/21/05 14:42:02] <DaveJorgenen-N43> N43 descending from ferry altitude to 12k ft
[GMT 09/21/05 14:42:07] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Rogers-n43, TRMM pass is in - shows nice eyewall wrapped from E-N-W-SW. we're going to try and send you the image standby

[GMT 09/21/05 14:43:54] <Rogers-n43> great, thx Bob
[GMT 09/21/05 14:44:06] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgenen-N43, Rogers-n43 it is a very complete image this time
[GMT 09/21/05 14:44:25] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Rogers-n43, Image time is 09Z today not 14Z.
[GMT 09/21/05 14:44:34] <DaveJorgenen-N43> Ops what is the URL for the TRMM imagery?

[GMT 09/21/05 14:45:44] <Rogers-n43> Greg, ok.  So we've seen that one already right?
[GMT 09/21/05 14:46:22] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgenen-N43, <Sanitized>/NRL/other_images
[GMT 09/21/05 14:46:33] <DaveJorgenen-N43> Ops - were approaching the inner band - seems very stgratiform on LF max dbz only about 30-35
[GMT 09/21/05 14:46:37] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgenen-N43, it's not there yet
[GMT 09/21/05 14:46:43] <DaveJorgenen-N43> thansk
[GMT 09/21/05 14:46:46] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Rogers-n43, The next TRMM pass is at 1540 today so you need to wait a bit - not sure how good the geometry will be.
[GMT 09/21/05 14:47:32] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgenen-N43, the trmm image is for 0940--so it's not extremely current
[GMT 09/21/05 14:48:02] <DaveJorgenen-N43> yes, we saw this image before we departed
[GMT 09/21/05 14:48:43] <Rogers-n43> ok thx greg
[GMT 09/21/05 14:48:59] <Rogers-n43> how about ssm/i?  anything more current there?
[GMT 09/21/05 14:49:08] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Rogers-n43, I'll keep an eye out for the next one.
[GMT 09/21/05 14:49:12] <DaveJorgenen-N43> there are two inner rainbands NE of the eye - we're entering the outer one near 25.14N 84.28W
[GMT 09/21/05 14:49:15] <ShuyiChen-opc> Rob&Dave, the 0940Z TMI you saw showed the concentric inner eyewall and also indicate the 2ndary "eyewall" ring were to form.
[GMT 09/21/05 14:49:30] <DaveJorgenen-N43> I concur Shuyi
[GMT 09/21/05 14:49:45] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Ops--did you see my question about current storm center location?
[GMT 09/21/05 14:50:19] <DaveJorgenen-N43> Ops - the innermost "inner" band is perhaps 10 nm inside of the band we're passing through
[GMT 09/21/05 14:50:20] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Rogers-n43, Latest SSM/I at 1247Z - Did you see that one also?
[GMT 09/21/05 14:50:24] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, my estimate is 24.2/85.7
[GMT 09/21/05 14:50:52] <DaveJorgenen-N43> Ops - this inner band is about as stratiform as they get - so smooth that we're having a hard time keeping awake
[GMT 09/21/05 14:51:04] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- thanks, I'll pass that along to our nav
[GMT 09/21/05 14:51:08] <DaveJorgenen-N43> bright band to 40 dBZ however
[GMT 09/21/05 14:51:13] <ShuyiChen-opc> model forecast that the 2ndary eyewall should gradually establish during the day. Let me know if you see that on LF.
[GMT 09/21/05 14:51:27] <Rogers-n43> shuyi -- ok we will
[GMT 09/21/05 14:51:34] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, that estimate is based on the lf image
[GMT 09/21/05 14:51:54] <DaveJorgenen-N43> Ops we see pieces of outer eyewall/inner band but highly stratiform
[GMT 09/21/05 14:52:08] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgenen-N43, is there any coffee to keep you awake in all that SF?
[GMT 09/21/05 14:52:28] Action: ChrisBurghart-Boulder is back (gone 16:32:09)
[GMT 09/21/05 14:52:48] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Rogers-n43, SSM/I at 1247 shows eyewall even more completely wrapped around Strong Rainband around to SE about 80-90 nm.
[GMT 09/21/05 14:52:57] <DaveJorgenen-N43> I have Mike Black to keep me awake
[GMT 09/21/05 14:53:07] <ShuyiChen-opc> Good!
[GMT 09/21/05 14:53:07] <Rogers-n43> Greg -- ok great.  Can you put that on the web too please?
[GMT 09/21/05 14:53:07] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgenen-N43, even better
[GMT 09/21/05 14:53:10] <DaveJorgenen-N43> Ops no secondary tangential wind max in this band so I don't think its an "outer eyewall"
[GMT 09/21/05 14:53:19] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- ok, thanks
[GMT 09/21/05 14:54:09] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Rogers-n43, Standby we're sending you the SSM/I image.
[GMT 09/21/05 14:54:10] <terry-n43> I'll just turn off the radar's... that'll wake Dave up!
[GMT 09/21/05 14:54:18] <Rogers-n43> ok thx greg
[GMT 09/21/05 14:54:23] <DaveJorgenen-N43> we're through the band now - LF presentation doesn't show it to be concentric about eye so its not a double eye structure yet
[GMT 09/21/05 14:54:38] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgenen-N43,you're probably a bit far out to see a 2nd wind max
[GMT 09/21/05 14:55:13] <DaveJorgenen-N43> Ops - we're entering the innermost of the two bands now 24.79N 84.45W
[GMT 09/21/05 14:55:38] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- can you tell me what the file name is on the SSM/I image?
[GMT 09/21/05 14:56:11] <DaveJorgenen-N43> Ops - some small embedded cells on TA but still highly stratiform
[GMT 09/21/05 14:56:12] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, It's the only one that starts with ssmi
[GMT 09/21/05 14:56:55] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GaryGranger-Boulder-- ok.  must not have been there when I refreshed
[GMT 09/21/05 14:57:04] <Rogers-n43> ops -- can you send a url for the ssmi image please?
[GMT 09/21/05 14:57:29] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgenen-N43, I think the 2nd eyewall will be a little closer to the eyewall, just inside your IP perhaps

[GMT 09/21/05 14:58:59] <ShuyiChen-opc> Dave&Rob: we've been trying to anwser the question of "is the rainband lead the 2ndary wind max or vis versa"? Hope we'll find something to shed some light on that today. 
[GMT 09/21/05 14:59:34] <DaveJorgenen-N43> bit more bumpy in this band
[GMT 09/21/05 14:59:35] <Jasmine-nrlp3> NRL has taken off
[GMT 09/21/05 15:00:07] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgenen-N43, how bumpy in m/s?
[GMT 09/21/05 15:00:31] <DaveJorgenen-N43> 70 knot winds at 700 mb about 65 nm from the eye center
[GMT 09/21/05 15:00:56] <Rogers-n43> TA is showing low-level outflow from the storm on inner edge of this band and low-level inflow to the storm on outer edge of band
[GMT 09/21/05 15:01:09] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- just to repeat, we took of at 1500 UTC
[GMT 09/21/05 15:01:24] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, Thx Jasmine.
[GMT 09/21/05 15:01:43] <DaveJorgenen-N43> winds are dropping off as we exit the band on the way to the eye
[GMT 09/21/05 15:01:43] <BobHouze-Ops> Rogers-n43, thanks for that observation
[GMT 09/21/05 15:01:54] <DaveJorgenen-N43> now down to 60 knots

[GMT 09/21/05 15:02:32] <JessicaKoury-Ops> terry-n43, yes, both data streams are good
[GMT 09/21/05 15:03:08] <DaveJorgenen-N43> two more weak bands on LF between us and the eyewall on about 10 nm out from the eyewall another 25 nm from the eyewall

[GMT 09/21/05 15:26:02] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Another band is showing up at about 24.5, 83.0 oriented N-S probably wrapping NNW - you may run into it on that track
[GMT 09/21/05 15:26:50] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> out of eyewall now only weak bands to our W
[GMT 09/21/05 15:27:03] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Better track for you would be to head west first then south - things are more stratiform on the north end of the outer band.
[GMT 09/21/05 15:27:29] <BradSmull-NRL> Understood, Greg--from what DaveJ has reported none of these bands are particularly severe turbulence-wise...right?
[GMT 09/21/05 15:27:51] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> that is correct Brad
[GMT 09/21/05 15:28:09] <GregStossmeister-Ops> That's correct you should follow their track in.
[GMT 09/21/05 15:28:30] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> even the eyewall wasn't that bumpy compared to some MCSs we've flown
[GMT 09/21/05 15:28:59] <BradSmull-NRL> Thx Greg--that info is coming a bit late, but we will turn that direction (which is now somewhat north of west)

[GMT 09/21/05 15:29:07] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, I meant you should follow 43's track to the IP.
[GMT 09/21/05 15:29:46] <BradSmull-NRL> Greg--we don't really have "their track", so a general latitude is good. I think we're clear. Now turning to track 310
[GMT 09/21/05 15:29:49] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> bands on W side very weak - lots of enhanced stratiform looking reflectivity to the N of the eye

[GMT 09/21/05 15:31:17] <ShuyiChen-opc> Dave: it's typical for the downwind side of the bands to be more stratiform on the W, is that right?
[GMT 09/21/05 15:31:23] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Our eyewall drop on E side showed 160 knots max winds 500 feet about surface
[GMT 09/21/05 15:31:32] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> that is correct Shuyi
[GMT 09/21/05 15:31:36] <BradSmull-NRL> Thx Greg

[GMT 09/21/05 15:32:48] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> I long for the days of 1500 ft altitude penetrations!
[GMT 09/21/05 15:33:16] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Brad we would suggest you move your IP toward the west approximately 10 nm to keep up with the storm.

[GMT 09/21/05 15:34:09] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> we dropped 2 in the eyewall Shuyi, the first had the 160 knots wind max 500 ft above the sfc, 105 knots at splash Mike is still processing the 2nd eyewall drop
[GMT 09/21/05 15:34:44] <BradSmull-NRL> GregStossmeister-Ops, appears we have to get W to 85 or even 86 W to drop south and avoid intense precip

[GMT 09/21/05 15:36:31] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, You should be free of it by around 85 - don't track too far west or you'll be out of position.

[GMT 09/21/05 15:38:05] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, 86 is too far.

[GMT 09/21/05 16:19:31] <BradSmull-NRL> We are on coordinated upwind track, but see no firm evidence of a "band" between us & 43 in this sector
[GMT 09/21/05 16:19:37] <BobHouze-Ops> Rogers-n43, we gave you 60 nm legs and reverse track. coordinate with nrl.
[GMT 09/21/05 16:20:29] <BobHouze-Ops> Rogers-n43, we could give you a point if you need it 
[GMT 09/21/05 16:21:34] <JessicaKoury-Ops> terry_n43, we seem to have lost the 1Hz stream (but we are still receiving LF data)
[GMT 09/21/05 16:21:43] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops--it wouldn't hurt to pass along an endpoint to us as well
[GMT 09/21/05 16:22:05] <BobHouze-Ops> Rogers-n43, a suggested point B is 24.8/84.8
[GMT 09/21/05 16:22:20] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Bob, is that point B for NRL or 43?

[GMT 09/21/05 16:29:57] <Rogers-n43> ok Bob
[GMT 09/21/05 16:30:22] <BradSmull-NRL> Correction, we see now--43 is behind us. Navs will need to work on coordination for reverse leg
[GMT 09/21/05 16:30:36] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, On the current track we do not see that seperation.
[GMT 09/21/05 16:30:53] <BradSmull-NRL> Our understanding is that N43 needs to be displace radially inward on downwind track
[GMT 09/21/05 16:31:06] <BradSmull-NRL> And that we are at an appropriate radial distance from the storm

[GMT 09/21/05 16:31:41] <BobHouze-Ops> Rogers-n43, for your upwind leg we suggest going downwind from point 2-24.8/84.8 to point 1-25.2/85.7-
[GMT 09/21/05 16:31:48] <BradSmull-NRL> NRL is nearing turn-around point

[GMT 09/21/05 16:32:12] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, if you reverse track you are ok
[GMT 09/21/05 16:32:37] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, 43 will go inside of band on the reverse track
[GMT 09/21/05 16:32:43] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Ops - we're on the wrong band, my chat's been down for 40 min, we will move inward for downwind run with NRL

[GMT 09/21/05 16:48:50] <Rogers-n43> we'll do a drop at that point and a drop at the midpoint too ok?

[GMT 09/21/05 17:06:36] <BobHouze-Ops> Rogers-n43, if you go to point 3 you will cross the correct band and then be on the inside of the correct band
[GMT 09/21/05 17:06:42] <Deanna-ops> BradSmull-NRL, no I didn't ask...sorry
[GMT 09/21/05 17:07:07] <BobHouze-Ops>  Rogers-n43 nrl will be on the outside of the band 
[GMT 09/21/05 17:07:16] <Rogers-n43> bob -- ok thx
[GMT 09/21/05 17:07:18] <BradSmull-NRL> Altitudes are critical for separation/safety
[GMT 09/21/05 17:07:22] <DaveJorgensen-n43> will we go downwind from there?
[GMT 09/21/05 17:07:49] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- we're at point D and are turning now to head to point C
[GMT 09/21/05 17:08:03] <ShuyiChen-opc> Brad: I think AF usually at 10,000 ft.
[GMT 09/21/05 17:08:04] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, 43 will go upwind back to point 1
[GMT 09/21/05 17:08:26] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, 43 will go upwind back to point 1 after getting to point 3

[GMT 09/21/05 17:08:53] <BradSmull-NRL> Thx Shuyi--but I'm sure Carl would prefer confirmation of that for today
[GMT 09/21/05 17:09:15] <Rogers-n43> Ops -- turning downwind to get to pt 3
[GMT 09/21/05 17:09:20] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, repeat point 3 is 24.5/86.5 and point 1 is 25.2/85.7

[GMT 09/21/05 17:21:58] <Rogers-n43> do you want to tell us how long to make the legs?
[GMT 09/21/05 17:22:08] <BobHouze-Ops> Rogers-n43, 60 nm would be good
[GMT 09/21/05 17:22:13] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- ok, wonderful
[GMT 09/21/05 17:22:15] <Rogers-n43> Bob, ok
[GMT 09/21/05 17:22:44] <BobHouze-Ops> Rogers-n43, there are a lot of small banded features running NE-SW. Any of them will work
[GMT 09/21/05 17:22:46] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, Thx.
[GMT 09/21/05 17:23:05] <Rogers-n43> Bob -- ok
[GMT 09/21/05 17:23:06] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, we are asking 43 to line up with you and do 60 nm legs
[GMT 09/21/05 17:23:11] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- thanks for checking on us!
[GMT 09/21/05 17:23:31] <Rogers-n43> Ops -- we're going to go to that pt 1 you had given
[GMT 09/21/05 17:23:39] <Rogers-n43> then reverse track and head downwind
[GMT 09/21/05 17:23:44] <Rogers-n43> for a 60-nm length leg
[GMT 09/21/05 17:23:47] <Rogers-n43> how does that sound?
[GMT 09/21/05 17:23:59] <BobHouze-Ops> Rogers-n43, ok that's good

[GMT 09/21/05 17:24:23] <BobHouze-Ops> Rogers-n43, just keep nrl outside of you whatever track you take
[GMT 09/21/05 17:24:33] <Rogers-n43> Bob -- ok
[GMT 09/21/05 17:24:45] <BobHouze-Ops> Rogers-n43, you are in pretty good coord with them at the moment
[GMT 09/21/05 17:24:47] <BradSmull-NRL> Ops--now that we're well coordinated w/ N43, suggest we stick with this quadrant for a little while
[GMT 09/21/05 17:25:12] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, I agree. 43 should coord directly with you
[GMT 09/21/05 17:25:14] <Rogers-n43> Bob -- great....dave says a zeb image shows great tracks
[GMT 09/21/05 17:25:53] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Rogers-n43, Jasmine-nrlp3 BradSmull-NRL Just  to give you a heads up that in about 45 minutes we will want to move you to the SW of the storm center and set up the same kind of coordinated patterns.
[GMT 09/21/05 17:25:57] <Rogers-n43> Ops -- so after we reverse track and come back downwind for 60 nm, should we reverse track again and come upwind for anoher 60 nm?
[GMT 09/21/05 17:26:38] <BradSmull-NRL> GregStossmeister-Ops, OK, so that assumes one more complete upwind/downwind cycle. Good.
[GMT 09/21/05 17:26:46] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Rogers-n43, Yes -that's right Rob.
[GMT 09/21/05 17:26:49] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Ops - band to our left is getting stronger reflectivity now - narrow ribbon of 40 dbz
[GMT 09/21/05 17:27:16] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Yes - correct. We are trying to spend just under an hour in each quadrant.
[GMT 09/21/05 17:27:19] <Rogers-n43> Ops -- ok, so we'll turn downwind, go 60 nm, then turn upwind, repeat
[GMT 09/21/05 17:27:19] <DaveJorgensen-n43> overshooting tops on TA to a few km above the bright band
[GMT 09/21/05 17:28:06] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Rogers-n43, Sounds good Rob.
[GMT 09/21/05 17:28:15] <Rogers-n43> Greg -- ok
[GMT 09/21/05 17:29:53] <Rogers-n43> ops -- turning right 20 degrees, concurrent with NRL
[GMT 09/21/05 17:30:21] <BradSmull-NRL> Good coordination!
[GMT 09/21/05 17:30:23] <BobHouze-Ops> Rogers-n43, good move
[GMT 09/21/05 17:32:38] <DaveJorgensen-n43> we will try to coordinate our turns so that the two AC will match up on the mid-point of the downwind leg
[GMT 09/21/05 17:33:05] <BradSmull-NRL> NRL is approaching our NE-most point, planning 90/270 in 2-3 minutes
[GMT 09/21/05 17:33:24] <Rogers-n43> N43 will do same thing at same time
[GMT 09/21/05 17:33:35] <Rogers-n43> should match up as dave indicated
[GMT 09/21/05 17:33:58] <BradSmull-NRL> NRL turning to begin downwind leg
[GMT 09/21/05 17:34:00] <DaveJorgensen-n43> we'll turn too
[GMT 09/21/05 17:34:15] <Rogers-n43> once we finish turn we will do a RAINEX drop
[GMT 09/21/05 17:34:36] <Jasmine-nrlp3> We just dropped sonde at our endpoint
[GMT 09/21/05 17:34:42] <BradSmull-NRL> In this case, copy-catting is a -good- thing
[GMT 09/21/05 17:35:07] <BradSmull-NRL> Just to confirm that we will drop every 7 min on the downwind leg
[GMT 09/21/05 17:35:18] <Rogers-n43> we will too
[GMT 09/21/05 17:35:36] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Yes I think that is Shuyi's plan.
[GMT 09/21/05 17:36:43] <BradSmull-NRL> GregStossmeister-Ops, Thanks
[GMT 09/21/05 17:37:13] <DaveJorgensen-n43> we're rolling out on track 230 for the downwind run on the inside of band
[GMT 09/21/05 17:37:52] <Rogers-n43> RAINEX drop away
[GMT 09/21/05 17:38:21] <BradSmull-NRL> NRL is still in our 90/270 turn
[GMT 09/21/05 17:39:38] <DaveJorgensen-n43> that's OK Brad, we'll meet on the downwind end
[GMT 09/21/05 17:39:56] <BradSmull-NRL> Understood, Dave
[GMT 09/21/05 17:40:23] <BradSmull-NRL> NRL now rolling out on our track of 220
[GMT 09/21/05 17:41:31] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Brad - we're also just rolling out to start our leg, we did an orbit to wait a bit for you
[GMT 09/21/05 17:43:19] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- to confirm, after this reverse track, we'll next be working the SW quadrant, correct?
[GMT 09/21/05 17:45:40] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine- Which point are you talking about reversing at? Wwe would like you to make the current downwind pass, a return upwind and then move downwind to the SW.
[GMT 09/21/05 17:46:32] <DaveJorgensen-n43> That's our plan too Greg
[GMT 09/21/05 17:46:34] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- ok, so we understand, you want one more cycle of this NW quadrant, right?
[GMT 09/21/05 17:46:41] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Rogers-n43, DaveJorgensen-n43 Are you on the same page with us - you'll do the current downwind pass, return upwind and then move downwind to the SW quadrant?
[GMT 09/21/05 17:46:48] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, Correct.
[GMT 09/21/05 17:46:54] <BradSmull-NRL> GregStossmeister-Ops, sounds great--coordination is good, would be a shame to interrupt it prematurely
[GMT 09/21/05 17:46:59] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops--thanks, we just wanted to check

[GMT 09/21/05 17:48:44] <ShuyiChen-opc> Jasmine: how many dropped so far?
[GMT 09/21/05 17:48:50] <DaveJorgensen-n43> The band, however, is loosing its identity on the radar, just a mass of stratiform right now to our right

[GMT 09/21/05 17:53:32] <ShuyiChen-opc> Jasmine: it'd be ideal if we can have roughly same amont of sondes for each quadrant of the storm.
[GMT 09/21/05 17:53:41] <DaveJorgensen-n43> band is better defined the more we move to the SW
[GMT 09/21/05 17:53:53] <JessicaKoury-Ops> terry, we have stopped receiving LF data.
[GMT 09/21/05 17:54:33] <terry> yes, i know... I'm working it now
[GMT 09/21/05 17:54:35] <BradSmull-NRL> OK, nav has delayed turn in coordination w/ N43. Nav's are talking closely--excellent

[GMT 09/21/05 17:54:59] <Jasmine-nrlp3> ShuyiChen-opc-- ok, I'll relay that message
[GMT 09/21/05 17:55:16] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Brad - did you cross the band at near the mid point of the track? Are tracks are pretty close now
[GMT 09/21/05 17:55:17] <terry> radar data is being captured & stored, but issues appear to be in the gateway
[GMT 09/21/05 17:55:36] <DaveJorgensen-n43> starting our 90/270
[GMT 09/21/05 17:55:57] <Jasmine-nrlp3> ShuyiChen-opc-- we are doing more cycles in this NW quadrant, so we will have more sondes.
[GMT 09/21/05 17:56:26] <BradSmull-NRL> DaveJorgensen-n43,  no, not exactly, though we may have wandered a bit farther away from it (in a radially-outward sense)
[GMT 09/21/05 17:57:07] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, DaveJorgensen-n43 On your reverse track you are starting right now, can you turn back down wind at the mid point of the legs you just did? Do you need us to suggest some points? We'd like to be in the SW quad by 2:20 ish.
[GMT 09/21/05 17:57:21] <ShuyiChen-opc> Jasmine: That's OK, just a rough number.
[GMT 09/21/05 17:57:39] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Greg - OK
[GMT 09/21/05 17:58:06] <Jasmine-nrlp3> ShuyiChen-opc-- ok, as long as we're all on the same page.  :)
[GMT 09/21/05 17:58:07] <BradSmull-NRL> GregStossmeister-Ops, We understand and concur--will reverse at 30 nm along this upwind leg
[GMT 09/21/05 17:58:29] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, DaveJorgensen-n43 Thanks guys - sounds good.
[GMT 09/21/05 17:58:38] <Jasmine-nrlp3> ShuyiChen-opc-- do you want us to drop at the next turn, and then assume 7 min drop after that?
[GMT 09/21/05 17:59:02] <BradSmull-NRL> Ops - We have some time, but points along our downwind extension into SW quadrant will be helpful at some point
[GMT 09/21/05 17:59:26] <DaveJorgensen-n43> we'll tell the NRL when to turn so we'll go coordinated to the SW
[GMT 09/21/05 17:59:53] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Ops I agree, pts would be nice to define our next SW track
[GMT 09/21/05 18:00:04] <JessicaKoury-Ops> terry, Is there a chance that we'll get LF data again, or is it a lost cause at this point?

[GMT 09/21/05 18:08:47] <terry-n43> yahoo!!!
[GMT 09/21/05 18:08:47] <BobHouze-Ops> terry-n43, another RAINEX kudo
[GMT 09/21/05 18:08:49] <Jasmine-nrlp3> terry-n43-- thanks, we really appreciate it on NRL  :)
[GMT 09/21/05 18:09:14] <terry-n43> sorry for the gap... Miss Piggy needed a talking to
[GMT 09/21/05 18:09:33] <terry-n43> but at least the data was still being recorded
[GMT 09/21/05 18:09:37] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Ops - band is still well defined to the N less defined to the W and SW
[GMT 09/21/05 18:09:40] <Rogers-n43> fyi....AF plan found a *surface* wind from a drop of 172 kt
[GMT 09/21/05 18:09:52] <Rogers-n43> but there is some question of the reliability of that drop
[GMT 09/21/05 18:10:06] <DaveJorgensen-n43> not sure how we'll do going to SW by radar
[GMT 09/21/05 18:10:54] <terry-n43> jasmine... i know that we're your eyes... so i'll do my best to keep bits flowing  :)
[GMT 09/21/05 18:11:12] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, do you mean patterns on radar are ill defined there?
[GMT 09/21/05 18:11:17] <BradSmull-NRL> OK Dave, understood--but at a minimum, let's have navs keep our tracks coordinated/parallel
[GMT 09/21/05 18:11:44] <Jasmine-nrlp3> terry-n43--thanks terry, you're the best!!!
[GMT 09/21/05 18:11:47] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, agreed
[GMT 09/21/05 18:12:07] <Rogers-n43> n43 turning 360 now, then 90-270 so nrl will catch up to us
[GMT 09/21/05 18:12:18] <DaveJorgensen-n43> yes Brad, we'll maintain parallel tracks but radar bands are not well defined and we both may wander a bit
[GMT 09/21/05 18:12:35] <DaveJorgensen-n43> we've started our 90/270 turn
[GMT 09/21/05 18:13:06] TrS (shepherd@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &RAINEX.
[GMT 09/21/05 18:13:44] <Jasmine-nrlp3> NRL turning in approx. 5 minutes
[GMT 09/21/05 18:13:53] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, BradSmull-NRL based on Terry's new image it looks like the bands continue around to the SW with the same curvature. The exact band your in may end but you can adjust to another one
[GMT 09/21/05 18:14:01] <BradSmull-NRL> Dave, we're about 4 min from our turn
[GMT 09/21/05 18:14:10] <BradSmull-NRL> So perhaps you will want to insert a single orbit--your choice
[GMT 09/21/05 18:14:17] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Ops - any guidance as to how far S we should go on our trek to SW?
[GMT 09/21/05 18:14:21] <Rogers-n43> that's what we're doing
[GMT 09/21/05 18:15:02] <BradSmull-NRL> Dave - Bob previously said roughly 23.5
[GMT 09/21/05 18:15:13] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, about 60 nm s of eye, give or take, we'll give you some new points
[GMT 09/21/05 18:15:15] <DaveJorgensen-n43> OK, sorry I missed that
[GMT 09/21/05 18:15:21] <DaveJorgensen-n43> thanks
[GMT 09/21/05 18:15:40] <BradSmull-NRL> No worries, and note that was approximate
[GMT 09/21/05 18:16:28] <DaveJorgensen-n43> we've started our 90/270 after doing an orbit to allow the NRL to catch up
[GMT 09/21/05 18:18:48] <Jasmine-nrlp3> sonde dropped at our endpoint
[GMT 09/21/05 18:19:37] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, BradSmull-NRL greg is typing in new points for each a/c. you will each have a sw point and a s point that continues your work on the southern extension of the same band you are working
[GMT 09/21/05 18:19:57] <ShuyiChen-opc> Thx, Jas.
[GMT 09/21/05 18:20:16] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- ok, we'll wait for those points
[GMT 09/21/05 18:20:21] <DaveJorgensen-n43> OK, Ops we await
[GMT 09/21/05 18:20:54] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, DaveJorgensen-n43 Suggested points for SW quadrant are: 43 (Pt.5) 23.9/86.8 Pt.6 23.7/86.2  NRL points are (Pt. E) 23.6/87.1 and Pt. F 23.2/86.2
[GMT 09/21/05 18:21:03] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Brad - NHC just put out an update calling Rita a "strong cat 4" 150 mph sfc winds
[GMT 09/21/05 18:21:13] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, BradSmull-NRL remember letters are for nrl, numbers are for 43
[GMT 09/21/05 18:21:25] <DaveJorgensen-n43> got it Ops, thanks
[GMT 09/21/05 18:21:33] <BradSmull-NRL> Greg- Thx, we copy;   Dave--Wow!
[GMT 09/21/05 18:21:37] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- copy the points
[GMT 09/21/05 18:22:07] <Rogers-n43> Bob -- just relayed that to the nav
[GMT 09/21/05 18:22:30] <BobHouze-Ops> Rogers-n43, ok
[GMT 09/21/05 18:23:24] ChrisBurghart-Boulder (burghart@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &RAINEX.
[GMT 09/21/05 18:23:33] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Ops we'll use the points for guidance but track along the band to get good Doppler coverage as we go
[GMT 09/21/05 18:23:53] <BradSmull-NRL> Yep Bob--we're following your points "by the letter"  ;-)
[GMT 09/21/05 18:24:22] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, that is exactly our intent--ppoints are for guidance
[GMT 09/21/05 18:25:13] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Ops - OK, we're all on the same page
[GMT 09/21/05 18:25:42] <GregStossmeister-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, Stil! It's amazing!
[GMT 09/21/05 18:26:20] <DaveJorgensen-n43> if we lose band definition we may just break off and go to your Pt. 6 and regroup for the upwind run
[GMT 09/21/05 18:29:08] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Ops - we got about 45 min more of band work till we have to break off and do the last fig 4
[GMT 09/21/05 18:30:39] <GregStossmeister-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, That's a lot less than we figured. Your figure 4 will only take an hour. Could you recheck that please?
[GMT 09/21/05 18:31:25] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Ops - OK stand by
[GMT 09/21/05 18:32:37] <BradSmull-NRL> Ops, it will take NRL 25 min to get to the southmost point. Then we will have 20 min coord. with 43 before they break for the figure 4. We may need a plan after that.
[GMT 09/21/05 18:32:51] <Rogers-n43> Ops - one alternative is to do a single pass instead of a figure-4
[GMT 09/21/05 18:33:02] <Rogers-n43> or shorten the radial legs from 50 nm to something less
[GMT 09/21/05 18:33:18] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL,Time does not add up -hang on.
[GMT 09/21/05 18:33:30] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Ops - we have to be in the "chocks" by 1800 which means on the ground by 1730
[GMT 09/21/05 18:33:34] <BobHouze-Ops> Rogers-n43, rob we don't understand. when do you have to sart the ferry back to arrive by 6
[GMT 09/21/05 18:34:06] <BobHouze-Ops> dave we were told 6 pm landing this morning
[GMT 09/21/05 18:34:06] <Rogers-n43> if we finish up on the north side of the storm, it will take about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours ferry time
[GMT 09/21/05 18:34:33] <DaveJorgensen-n43> no in "chocks" by 1800
[GMT 09/21/05 18:34:47] <DaveJorgensen-n43> need time for taxi etc
[GMT 09/21/05 18:35:15] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, ok, ok that's different than we were told but we will refigure things now. it would be nice to know
[GMT 09/21/05 18:37:41] <DaveJorgensen-n43> yep
[GMT 09/21/05 18:38:06] <DaveJorgensen-n43> 'band is losing definition but we're trying to follow the same radius of curvature
[GMT 09/21/05 18:38:55] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, Rogers-n43 we will just make the one pass in the sw, then one pass in the se quadrant, then 43 can enter the eye and either do one pass through the center. while 43 goes through the center nrl can continue to work on the east side of the storm
[GMT 09/21/05 18:39:09] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Rogers-n43, one pass in SW and SE meaning no upwind legs -just move downwind coordinated an parallel
[GMT 09/21/05 18:39:28] <Rogers-n43> Bob and Greg -- ok that's what I was going to recommend too
[GMT 09/21/05 18:39:32] <DaveJorgensen-n43> got it
[GMT 09/21/05 18:40:53] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- ok, we understand the plan
[GMT 09/21/05 18:40:57] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Brad - we're orbiting to wait for you at 23.72N 86.70W
[GMT 09/21/05 18:41:34] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- when we move to the SE, what kind of legs do you want NRL to do?
[GMT 09/21/05 18:41:52] <BradSmull-NRL> DaveJorgensen-n43, got it.
[GMT 09/21/05 18:41:53] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, Rogers-n43 the lf composite indicates that the same band you have been working extends on around to the east side in a general sense
[GMT 09/21/05 18:42:01] <Rogers-n43> Bob -- would you like the final figure-4 to be E-W, downwind to S-N?  Or would you like the figure-4 to be rotated by 45 degrees so it would go SE, NW, downwind to SW, NE?
[GMT 09/21/05 18:42:03] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Brad - when we resume our band parallel trek we
[GMT 09/21/05 18:42:22] <DaveJorgensen-n43> we'll just continue around to the E using radar for guidance
[GMT 09/21/05 18:42:57] <BradSmull-NRL> Thx Bob--very helpful perspective
[GMT 09/21/05 18:43:05] <Rogers-n43> Bob -- ok thanks
[GMT 09/21/05 18:43:48] <Rogers-n43> Bob -- on my question, that would mean 43 would come upwind at the end of its downwind leg in the SE quadrant
[GMT 09/21/05 18:44:23] <BradSmull-NRL> NRL is turning to track 110. Dave-sounds reasonable
[GMT 09/21/05 18:44:26] <BobHouze-Ops> Rogers-n43, greg is typing something for you
[GMT 09/21/05 18:44:51] <Rogers-n43> bob - ok 
[GMT 09/21/05 18:45:01] <BradSmull-NRL> N43 coming out toward SE quadrant could be good for NRL--would help NRL get home
[GMT 09/21/05 18:45:17] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Rogers-n43, Here's what we'd like for your final figure 4 - Wait until you reached the pt due East of Center fly west through the center and penetrate just west of the western eyewall, do a small downwind leg to the south then come back through the eye and exit north and home. Is that doable?
[GMT 09/21/05 18:45:45] <Rogers-n43> Greg -- so in other words it would be a shorter outbound leg to the west?
[GMT 09/21/05 18:46:00] <Rogers-n43> oh wait ok i see sorry
[GMT 09/21/05 18:46:35] jimm (jimm@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &RAINEX.
[GMT 09/21/05 18:46:48] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Rogers-n43, yes shorter outbound to the west, short down wind all just outside the eyewall then north through the center and home.
[GMT 09/21/05 18:46:51] <Rogers-n43> ok so my question still stands
[GMT 09/21/05 18:46:52] <Rogers-n43> ok
[GMT 09/21/05 18:47:04] <Rogers-n43> ok and what about drops?
[GMT 09/21/05 18:47:16] <Rogers-n43> i presume no HRD drop on the west turn point, just RAINEX drops right?
[GMT 09/21/05 18:47:19] <jimm> question about the end of 43's flight today?  aircraft must be in the chocks at 1800L.
[GMT 09/21/05 18:47:27] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- GregStossmeister-Ops--do you have an idea about what you'd like NRL to do once 43 breaks for their figure 4?
[GMT 09/21/05 18:48:07] <jimm> it's always been that way.
[GMT 09/21/05 18:48:51] <jimm> plane must be in the hangar and all crew members out of the hangar by 1900L.
[GMT 09/21/05 18:49:05] <jimm> what part of this don't you folks understand?
[GMT 09/21/05 18:49:09] <GregStossmeister-Ops> jimm-we did not understand that meant the aircraft had to actually land 30 min before that time - Sorry I missed that earlier. I understand now thank.
[GMT 09/21/05 18:49:18] <DaveJorgensen-n43> I understand it Jim
[GMT 09/21/05 18:49:19] <ShuyiChen-opc> Rob: use RAINEX sondes in the eyewall and ctr.
[GMT 09/21/05 18:49:28] <Rogers-n43> ok shuyi
[GMT 09/21/05 18:49:49] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Brad - we're moving radially outward about 10 miles to pick up the band again
[GMT 09/21/05 18:50:11] <ShuyiChen-opc> Rob: how many rainex sondes n43 dropped so far?
[GMT 09/21/05 18:50:39] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, we'd like nrl to do tracks along a band in the east-northeast sector. Will try to set you up based on 43's lf data. If successful you can do as many reverse tracks along it as is feasible while 43 is in their final fig. 4
[GMT 09/21/05 18:50:55] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Brad - the one we were tracking has completely lost its identity
[GMT 09/21/05 18:51:16] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- ok, I'll let Wen Chau know
[GMT 09/21/05 18:51:19] <Rogers-n43> shuyi -- 15 sondes
[GMT 09/21/05 18:51:30] <BradSmull-NRL> DaveJorgensen-n43, we see that
[GMT 09/21/05 18:52:07] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Brad - on the LF this band spirals nicely to the East side
[GMT 09/21/05 18:52:16] <jimm> word about 42, if you haven't heard.
[GMT 09/21/05 18:52:35] <jimm> FCF will take place at 1630L today, weather permitting.
[GMT 09/21/05 18:52:50] <GregStossmeister-Ops> jimm - FCF is a test flight?
[GMT 09/21/05 18:53:03] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- ok, we all understand.  Hopefully the LF will give us some insight (wink wink, Terry)
[GMT 09/21/05 18:53:06] <jimm> if successful, we will set up an 0930 takeoff for ocean winds tomorrow.
[GMT 09/21/05 18:53:28] <jimm> Functional Check Flight - sorry.
[GMT 09/21/05 18:53:42] <GregStossmeister-Ops> jimm Thanks Jim.
[GMT 09/21/05 18:53:44] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, it looks like you are about to snag another band that extends up to a point about 70 nm from storm center
[GMT 09/21/05 18:54:17] <Rogers-n43> RAINEX drop/BT combo away
[GMT 09/21/05 18:54:18] <DaveJorgensen-n43> yep
[GMT 09/21/05 18:54:29] <BradSmull-NRL> Ops, to confirm that NRL will continue downwind to NE of the center.
[GMT 09/21/05 18:54:37] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43, BradSmull-NRL , Rogers-n43 looks like you are getting set with a nice band to your left
[GMT 09/21/05 18:54:47] <DaveJorgensen-n43> yep
[GMT 09/21/05 18:54:55] <DaveJorgensen-n43> nice presentation on LF
[GMT 09/21/05 18:55:59] <BradSmull-NRL> OK Bob, but it can't (shouldn't) be to -everyone's- left....
[GMT 09/21/05 18:56:00] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, when you tuck up next to this band on your left you can continue to follow it up into the NE quadrant and do reverse tracks on it as long as it is well defined on your nose radar
[GMT 09/21/05 18:56:45] <DaveJorgensen-n43> once we get to the E side (ie the winds are 180) we'll go back through the center to perhaps 10 nm outside of western eyewall then a short downwind leg to S of eye then back through the eye exit to N and then RTB
[GMT 09/21/05 18:56:45] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, thanks for your correction. it's on 43's right and nrl's left
[GMT 09/21/05 18:57:00] <BradSmull-NRL> OPs, NRL can use a few points toward NE.
[GMT 09/21/05 18:57:21] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, we will start working on them now
[GMT 09/21/05 18:57:25] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Brad - can you just parallel 43 track?
[GMT 09/21/05 18:58:01] <BradSmull-NRL> Understood--LF presentation looks pretty clear, and yes Dave, I think we can parallel your track , at least until you break off for your Fig-4
[GMT 09/21/05 18:58:27] <DaveJorgensen-n43> OK Brad
[GMT 09/21/05 18:58:31] <ShuyiChen-opc> Rob: thx. We can use ~10-12 more rainex sondes for the last figure 4 (9 sondes) and the rest downwind leg on E side.
[GMT 09/21/05 18:59:06] <Rogers-n43> shuyi -- ok
[GMT 09/21/05 18:59:16] <ShuyiChen-opc> Rob: that will make it total of 25-27 rainex sondes for today.
[GMT 09/21/05 19:00:56] <Jasmine-nrlp3> ShuyiChen-opc-- still dropping sondes every 7 min, FYI
[GMT 09/21/05 19:01:02] <Rogers-n43> shuyi -- yes that's right 
[GMT 09/21/05 19:01:18] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Here are some points that start roughly E of the eye. These will continue you on your present track downwind along the band to N of the storm center Pt. G: 24.3/85.3 Pt H. 24.8/85.5 Pt. I 25.0/86.2
[GMT 09/21/05 19:01:53] <BradSmull-NRL> Thanks GregStossmeister-Ops , we copy
[GMT 09/21/05 19:02:09] <ShuyiChen-opc> Thx, Jas. Only on the downwind leg.
[GMT 09/21/05 19:02:10] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Great.
[GMT 09/21/05 19:03:35] <DaveJorgensen-n43> we're at the end of the leg, turning to track 270 for another penetration
[GMT 09/21/05 19:04:09] <DaveJorgensen-n43> Brad - good luck with the rest of the band work - see you back at the base
[GMT 09/21/05 19:04:17] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Ok Shuyi, you got it!
[GMT 09/21/05 19:07:03] <ShuyiChen-opc> Jasmine: cool! Can't ask for anything better. Will be a great dataset.
[GMT 09/21/05 19:07:04] <BradSmull-NRL> OK Dave--thanks to you, your Nav & Ops for what evolved into some excellent coordination
[GMT 09/21/05 19:08:05] <DaveJorgensen-n43> thanks to you guys too. If you'e looked at the 1902 zeb picture you'll see a pretty nice quad pattern
[GMT 09/21/05 19:08:50] <BradSmull-NRL> Yah Dave--later tracks have been textbook!  Maybe you should work them into your ABQ talk   ;-)
[GMT 09/21/05 19:09:42] <BradSmull-NRL> Dave--Wen-Chau suggests however that you do NOT show your flight track from Norman to Tampa (i.e. the one via San Juan!)
[GMT 09/21/05 19:10:44] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, our points still look pretty good on LF image that was 6 min ago. 
[GMT 09/21/05 19:10:55] <JessicaKoury-Ops> terry-n43, Hello, it looks like it might be time for some more sweet talk...we aren't getting either data stream down in Ops.
[GMT 09/21/05 19:10:55] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, we are about ot get a new image
[GMT 09/21/05 19:11:07] <BradSmull-NRL> Jasmine was just saying the same

[GMT 09/21/05 19:14:10] <terry-n43> I think they were scared... i was :)
[GMT 09/21/05 19:14:20] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL,  on your track, the band to your left will be better defined than the one on your right. They pinch together at your poiint I, where you will reverse track

[GMT 09/21/05 19:16:05] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- Point I should probably be shifted to 24.9/86.2
[GMT 09/21/05 19:16:10] <BradSmull-NRL> BobHouze-Ops, understood. At the moment they are of ~equal intensity/definition
[GMT 09/21/05 19:16:20] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops--from our view of the image we recieved
[GMT 09/21/05 19:16:23] <n43_RAMS_> the eye is spectacular!!

[GMT 09/21/05 19:17:48] <n43_RAMS_> but the day I look out and don't see the wing is when I'll get nervous!
[GMT 09/21/05 19:18:10] <n43_RAMS_> saw 160 kts flt lvl in east eyewall

[GMT 09/21/05 19:20:53] <BradSmull-NRL> DaveJorgensen-n43rf, with those winds/min pressure, it's hard to be surprised
[GMT 09/21/05 19:21:27] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Brad - the forward storm speed has also slowed to 7 knots
[GMT 09/21/05 19:22:35] <BradSmull-NRL> Thx Dave

[GMT 09/21/05 19:24:31] <terry-n43> BradSmull-NRL, what freq block are y'all using?
[GMT 09/21/05 19:24:48] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- confirm, you want us to reverse track, correct?
[GMT 09/21/05 19:24:50] <ShuyiChen-opc> Brad: I guess that's AF.
[GMT 09/21/05 19:24:51] <terry-n43> we are using "C"
[GMT 09/21/05 19:25:13] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, yes reverse now
[GMT 09/21/05 19:25:14] <terry-n43> they should be on block A
[GMT 09/21/05 19:25:22] <BradSmull-NRL> We are using E-band
[GMT 09/21/05 19:25:48] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops--ok, we're trying to find a spot to turn, its' getting tight!
[GMT 09/21/05 19:25:59] <Jasmine-nrlp3> LF doesn't really seem to show the complexity of what we're flying through
[GMT 09/21/05 19:26:06] <ShuyiChen-opc> Brad: AF only drop a limited number of sondes, perhaps wait a bit and see.
[GMT 09/21/05 19:27:01] <Jasmine-nrlp3> ShuyiChen-opc--we're stopping sondes in the upwind leg, as requested
[GMT 09/21/05 19:27:32] <BradSmull-NRL> terry-n43, you mean AF should be on block A?
[GMT 09/21/05 19:28:00] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- how far south do you want our endpoint to be on this reverse track?
[GMT 09/21/05 19:28:30] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, standby, I'll get you one
[GMT 09/21/05 19:28:52] <Jasmine-nrlp3> ok, thanks Bob
[GMT 09/21/05 19:29:26] <terry-n43> Jasmine & Brad, the 'standard' assignments are the Air Force on A
[GMT 09/21/05 19:29:33] <terry-n43> 42 on B
[GMT 09/21/05 19:29:36] <terry-n43> 43 on C

[GMT 09/21/05 19:29:49] <terry-n43> and E unassigned
[GMT 09/21/05 19:30:04] <terry-n43> I assume that y'all are using E?
[GMT 09/21/05 19:30:43] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Ops - we turning to track N for last pass through eye
[GMT 09/21/05 19:30:46] <BradSmull-NRL> Affirmative Terry--NRL is on E
[GMT 09/21/05 19:30:54] <terry-n43> but w 42 not dropping today, take B if you need to. That a one day offer, good only for today :)
[GMT 09/21/05 19:31:02] <BradSmull-NRL> We are contacting AF for confirmation they are on A
[GMT 09/21/05 19:31:09] <terry-n43> good idea
[GMT 09/21/05 19:31:39] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, what is your current position
[GMT 09/21/05 19:32:11] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- NRL is at 25.3/86.55
[GMT 09/21/05 19:32:26] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Ops our last eyewall drop on E side had 175 knot winds at 500 ft AGL
[GMT 09/21/05 19:32:55] <Jasmine-nrlp3> We are turning back toward point I (give or take)
[GMT 09/21/05 19:33:40] <ShuyiChen-opc> Dave: it seems that the sfc wind is most likely higher than the 130kts NHC says.
[GMT 09/21/05 19:33:56] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, head on back to H & G as long as that works
[GMT 09/21/05 19:34:02] <Rogers-n43> shuyi -- that same sonde showed 125 kt at about 100 ft AGL
[GMT 09/21/05 19:34:05] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> I would think so Shuyi
[GMT 09/21/05 19:34:13] <BradSmull-NRL> Amazing
[GMT 09/21/05 19:34:48] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- we're turning back into our pattern soon, just had to find a place to turn.
[GMT 09/21/05 19:35:00] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- ok, will do.
[GMT 09/21/05 19:36:14] <ShuyiChen-opc> Dave & Rob: let me know when you have a reading on MSLP at ctr. 
[GMT 09/21/05 19:36:16] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Brad - even more amazing our 2nd E eyewall drop had 185 knots at 500 ft
[GMT 09/21/05 19:36:23] <BradSmull-NRL> Teal-81 and N43RF have each other in-sight in the eye
[GMT 09/21/05 19:36:57] <BradSmull-NRL> Dave--that's awesome and terrible all at the same time
[GMT 09/21/05 19:37:04] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> yeah
[GMT 09/21/05 19:37:13] <Rogers-n43> and that drop dave mentioned had 157 (!) *surface* kt surface wind (18 m)

[GMT 09/21/05 19:39:08] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Brad - we just had a bird sighting just above us
[GMT 09/21/05 19:39:36] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Ops - our last fix had a 900 mb extrapolated sfc pressure
[GMT 09/21/05 19:39:53] <BradSmull-NRL> Dave--careful, Phil Kennedy struck a gull ? at 12 kft in the eye as Katrina made landfall in New Orleans
[GMT 09/21/05 19:41:00] <ShuyiChen-opc> Wow - 1.5 mb lower than Katrina.
[GMT 09/21/05 19:41:18] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, On your current track we'd like you to fly to a new point that is further east than G but inside an interesting band. The new point will be J: 24.3/85.2 So fly to J instead of G on this track.
[GMT 09/21/05 19:41:23] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- you're gonna love this ELDORA data.  I'm already drooling!
[GMT 09/21/05 19:41:25] <BradSmull-NRL> Careful tho Shuyi--Flight Director usually doesn't release extrapolated SLP's
[GMT 09/21/05 19:41:46] <ShuyiChen-opc> OK, Brad.

[GMT 09/21/05 19:44:49] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Jasmine-nrlp3  We are thinking of having you fly upwind along the band after you get to J so keep that in mind too.

[GMT 09/21/05 19:48:33] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Brad - if you think 62 is bad, try the 18 m/s that we're using!

[GMT 09/21/05 19:48:51] <Jasmine-nrlp3> ShuyiChen-opc-- when we eventually turn to go downwind, do you want us to start sondes again?
[GMT 09/21/05 19:48:57] <BradSmull-NRL> Deanna-ops, yes, in terms of DaveJ's obs it definitely makes sense. It's just that in Michael Bell's experience it's extremely rare to see
[GMT 09/21/05 19:49:11] <BradSmull-NRL> Dave--let's talk to John Gamache about that choice post-mission....
[GMT 09/21/05 19:49:11] <Deanna-ops> BradSmull-NRL, Ah
[GMT 09/21/05 19:49:37] <ShuyiChen-opc> Yes, Jas.

[GMT 09/21/05 19:50:16] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, BradSmull-NRL Ignore points G and J and follow the band you are on instead.
[GMT 09/21/05 19:50:38] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Ok
[GMT 09/21/05 19:50:57] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, how does that band look?
[GMT 09/21/05 19:51:02] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- which band, left or right of us?
[GMT 09/21/05 19:51:07] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Ops very highly stratiform on the N side
[GMT 09/21/05 19:51:26] <terry-n43> bands to the left, bands to the right....
[GMT 09/21/05 19:51:38] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, The band is on your left and may be rather weak.
[GMT 09/21/05 19:51:55] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Terry, you're oh so correct
[GMT 09/21/05 19:52:23] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- we see a better band to the right, so we want to follow that one
[GMT 09/21/05 19:52:35] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- is that ok?
[GMT 09/21/05 19:52:48] <BradSmull-NRL> GregStossmeister-Ops, we *think* we will be able to sample both bands
[GMT 09/21/05 19:52:59] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- how far south do you want us to go?
[GMT 09/21/05 19:53:32] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Can someone give NRL an update on the center of Reba? 
[GMT 09/21/05 19:53:41] <Deanna-ops> reba?

[GMT 09/21/05 19:54:22] <BobHouze-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, we think you should look at the one on your right. it may be the 2ndary eyewall . after you've seen it for a bit we'll try to navigate you out of the storm
[GMT 09/21/05 19:54:44] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> our last center fix was at 24.37 86.32 at about 1945Z

[GMT 09/21/05 19:56:15] <Jasmine-nrlp3> DaveJorgensen-n43rf-- thanks for the fix
[GMT 09/21/05 19:56:41] <Jasmine-nrlp3> BobHouze-Ops-- so you want us to go south until you say "turn around", right? :-)
[GMT 09/21/05 19:56:46] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Ops - we've reached the end of the fig 4 pattern and now turning towards TPA eta about 1 hour

[GMT 09/21/05 19:58:24] <BradSmull-NRL> We're on a great track now--continuing sampling of multiple features, with emphasis on seconday eyewall
[GMT 09/21/05 19:58:57] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> I see your track on the zeb display looks like a great track
[GMT 09/21/05 19:59:04] <BradSmull-NRL> Bands radially outward from our location have amazing structure... almost like a herringbone/sawblade pattern

[GMT 09/21/05 20:06:52] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, as you work back north on your reverse track we think best exit area near 25.0/85.9
[GMT 09/21/05 20:06:53] <BradSmull-NRL> NRL is turning around to begin downwind leg

[GMT 09/21/05 20:08:00] <BradSmull-NRL> GregStossmeister-Ops, thanks--we'll plan to reverse our track along band until we near that point. This has been an *amazing* leg... all scientists on board agree this is some of the best data we've seen in the project
[GMT 09/21/05 20:08:23] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Great to hear!

[GMT 09/21/05 20:10:05] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, You should track NE between cells to get out when you reach that point.
[GMT 09/21/05 20:10:40] <ShuyiChen-opc> Brad et al: this is the best rainex mission we've had so far, I think.

[GMT 09/21/05 20:14:42] <BradSmull-NRL> Again getting some interference on E-band sondes--exploring shift to 42's normal B-block (just for remainder of today)
[GMT 09/21/05 20:15:07] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, your latest image from 43 is gives the best picture indicating where your exit strategy will occur
[GMT 09/21/05 20:15:33] <terry-n43> that's right... it's a one day sale of 42's freq block!
[GMT 09/21/05 20:15:48] <BradSmull-NRL> Understood Bob--checking it out on the image
[GMT 09/21/05 20:16:02] <BradSmull-NRL> Thanks for the great blue-light special Terry
[GMT 09/21/05 20:17:00] <BradSmull-NRL> We
[GMT 09/21/05 20:17:08] <BradSmull-NRL> We're expecting to follow a track of approx 050 from recommended exit point
[GMT 09/21/05 20:17:59] <BradSmull-NRL> Ops--want to confirm that you intend us to *depart* after this current downwind leg. We have plenty of fuel, but recognize we will lose LF coverage
[GMT 09/21/05 20:18:36] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Yes exit -we don't want you out there after we lose lF coverage.
[GMT 09/21/05 20:19:10] <BradSmull-NRL> Understood Greg--just wanted to check.... we're lovin these data
[GMT 09/21/05 20:19:44] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, the last feature you sampled was similar to one that ELDORA sampled in Katrina
[GMT 09/21/05 20:20:32] <BradSmull-NRL> Yes Bob--Jasmine made same comment, including strange "inward sloping" inner eyewall structure
[GMT 09/21/05 20:21:21] <ShuyiChen-opc> Brad: Bob is almost right, except this is in the SE quadrant, which is extremely valuable, to say the least.
[GMT 09/21/05 20:22:58] <terry-n43> Brad & Jasmine, let me know when y'all don't need the radar any more. I don't want to secure it if you're still using it to get out of Rita/Reba/Riba... (rhymes with Margherita!)
[GMT 09/21/05 20:23:16] <BradSmull-NRL> OK Shuyi, we are reluctantly arranging our exit. This kinda hurts...
[GMT 09/21/05 20:23:35] <BradSmull-NRL> GregStossmeister-Ops,  how woud it be for us to follow 43's track out of the storm?
[GMT 09/21/05 20:23:42] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, If you continue on your current track any further to the west, the best exit for you will be to the North rather than NE.
[GMT 09/21/05 20:23:50] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, That would be fine.
[GMT 09/21/05 20:23:55] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, you could continue NW and find an exit directly north of the sorm if your prefer
[GMT 09/21/05 20:24:02] <BradSmull-NRL> as an alternate plan, I mean
[GMT 09/21/05 20:24:06] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, greg & I were thinking the same thing
[GMT 09/21/05 20:24:44] <BradSmull-NRL> OK Bob, we're leaning in that direction. DaveJorgensen-n43rf , how was your ride on your exit?
[GMT 09/21/05 20:25:01] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, you could follow 43's track which shows up on your lf images
[GMT 09/21/05 20:25:56] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> very smooth Brad once we cleared the eyewall, that eyewall ride was an E ticket though
[GMT 09/21/05 20:26:05] <BradSmull-NRL> Bob--we are doing exactly that
[GMT 09/21/05 20:26:37] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Deanna-ops-- JessicaKoury-Ops--I think this is one set of data you will actually enjoy processing!
[GMT 09/21/05 20:27:04] <JessicaKoury-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, I am looking forward to it!
[GMT 09/21/05 20:27:05] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Ops - our N eyewall drop had a 20 m wind of 165 knots!
[GMT 09/21/05 20:27:20] <BradSmull-NRL> We gathered that Dave--it kind of changed our mind about idea of getting some 1+ penetration patches for NRL today
[GMT 09/21/05 20:28:07] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, *Changed* your mind???? Something you weren't telling us???
[GMT 09/21/05 20:28:14] <Jasmine-nrlp3> JessicaKoury-Ops-- ok, be sure to send me gifs of those!!
[GMT 09/21/05 20:28:17] <BradSmull-NRL> DaveJorgensen-n43rf, you can see that our students are champing at the bit to get into these data, so once radar has cleared would you please commence transfer of capture file to my laptop?
[GMT 09/21/05 20:28:30] <JessicaKoury-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, sure thing!
[GMT 09/21/05 20:28:33] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> OK Brad, I'll start it now
[GMT 09/21/05 20:28:41] <BradSmull-NRL> Hey Greg, as they say, "mistakes happen"  ;-)
[GMT 09/21/05 20:28:42] <ShuyiChen-opc> Dave: it's just amazing - we seem to confirm higher winds with multiple sondes.

[GMT 09/21/05 20:32:28] <BradSmull-NRL> Greg--last drop is out and NRL is turning to track N out of system
[GMT 09/21/05 20:32:32] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, I had a feeling Carl really wanted another eye photo!
[GMT 09/21/05 20:33:14] <terry-n43> DaveJorgensen-n43rf, did it ask you for a password into windman?
[GMT 09/21/05 20:33:30] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Brad: Yes and I typed "aocnoaap3"
[GMT 09/21/05 20:33:37] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> then it returned the errror
[GMT 09/21/05 20:33:50] <Deanna-ops> DaveJorgensen-n43rf, in that SCP command you need to specify the files to be transferred
[GMT 09/21/05 20:33:50] <BradSmull-NRL> Hmmmmm... thinking
[GMT 09/21/05 20:33:59] <pchang_n42> scp -r
[GMT 09/21/05 20:34:08] <pchang_n42> that will grab the whole directory
[GMT 09/21/05 20:34:08] <Deanna-ops> so it should be scp filename windman@blah...
[GMT 09/21/05 20:34:15] <Deanna-ops> or that works too :)
[GMT 09/21/05 20:34:19] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> can I do a directory copy with the -r command?
[GMT 09/21/05 20:35:08] <BradSmull-NRL> the "no match" suggests that no packet fle was found in today's mission directory on windman--Paul's advice wil be useful
[GMT 09/21/05 20:35:18] <BradSmull-NRL> Dave, you could try replacing * with *.cap
[GMT 09/21/05 20:35:37] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> DaveJorgensen-n43rf: Make sure the filename (with wildcard) is in quotes, like: windman@192.168.3.218:"/data/raw/hurricane2005/radarPacketData/050921I/*" .
[GMT 09/21/05 20:36:07] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> That way the wildcard is expanded on the remote side.  Expanding on the local side is why you get "No match"
[GMT 09/21/05 20:36:11] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> OK will try
[GMT 09/21/05 20:36:16] <pchang_n42> scp -r <Sanitized>:/data/raw/hurricane2005/radarPacketData/050921I .
[GMT 09/21/05 20:36:18] <pchang_n42> will work
[GMT 09/21/05 20:36:29] <pchang_n42> that will just cp the whole directory and everything in it
[GMT 09/21/05 20:36:34] <pchang_n42> scp doesnt always like wildcards
[GMT 09/21/05 20:36:46] <BradSmull-NRL> Thanks Paul
[GMT 09/21/05 20:37:08] <pchang_n42> sounds like y'all had a fun flight :)
[GMT 09/21/05 20:37:33] <BradSmull-NRL> DEFINTELY!
[GMT 09/21/05 20:37:42] <Deanna-ops> pchang_n42, thanks for giving the *correct info, i was thinking of a different type of transfer and was therefore wrong :)
[GMT 09/21/05 20:37:42] <terry-n43> DaveJorgensen-n43rf, There appears to be a .cap file in the directory
[GMT 09/21/05 20:37:42] <terry-n43> penguin2:/data/raw/hurricane2005/radarPacketData/20050921I> ls
[GMT 09/21/05 20:37:42] <terry-n43> packetLogFile-13:54:16.cap
[GMT 09/21/05 20:39:00] <BradSmull-NRL> That sounds good dave--filename contains a time-hac for time file was opened, I believe
[GMT 09/21/05 20:39:08] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> oh yeah, best hurricane flight for me in over 20 years
[GMT 09/21/05 20:39:27] <marks-hrd> Roger-n43 can you go to #hrd?
[GMT 09/21/05 20:39:33] <BobHouze-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43rf, how many have you flown in the last 20 years?
[GMT 09/21/05 20:39:36] <Rogers-n43> sure frank
[GMT 09/21/05 20:39:36] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> yes Terry, that is what I'm trying to grab over to the laptop
[GMT 09/21/05 20:39:48] <BradSmull-NRL> Dave--is that what they mean when they say "you're getting older, but BETTER"????
[GMT 09/21/05 20:40:01] <terry-n43> yes, the 13:54:16 is teh start time of the radar data file
[GMT 09/21/05 20:40:07] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> including this one? just one
[GMT 09/21/05 20:40:26] <BradSmull-NRL> Dave--forgive the (unintentional) insult... at least I didn't mention the KISS rule...
[GMT 09/21/05 20:40:42] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> well Brad we're making progress the error now reads: scp: /data/raw/hurricane2005/radarPacketData/050921I: No such file or directory
[GMT 09/21/05 20:40:49] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> is there a way I can do an ls on it
[GMT 09/21/05 20:40:51] <terry-n43> But Dave, if you grab it... what will Jasmine have to look foward to :)
[GMT 09/21/05 20:41:19] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> bigger and better data?
[GMT 09/21/05 20:41:37] <Jasmine-nrlp3> I'ts so sad, Terry, but I guess we have to let you go home.  :(
[GMT 09/21/05 20:41:41] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> just getting OLDER
[GMT 09/21/05 20:41:45] <BradSmull-NRL> ls -al should work on my mac to confirm file size once copied, dave
[GMT 09/21/05 20:42:24] <terry-n43> Did anybody from rainex ever get yesterdays file, I know Mike Black grabbed it, but as long as Dave is grabbing files he might as well snag yesterdays if it's still needed
[GMT 09/21/05 20:43:09] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Terry, we have yesterday's already, thanks for checking!
[GMT 09/21/05 20:43:22] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> OK Brad but it says there is no file /data/raw/hurricane2005/radarPacketData/050921I
[GMT 09/21/05 20:43:55] <terry-n43> when did y'all sneak in to grab that??
[GMT 09/21/05 20:44:05] <GregStossmeister-Ops> terry-n43, While you're at it the drops from yesterday have not been sent to the JOSS ftp site yet.
[GMT 09/21/05 20:44:15] <Jasmine-nrlp3> terry-n43-- wouldn't you like to know...
[GMT 09/21/05 20:44:42] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Um, stacy, have to happened to glance at the 2042 image?  It's rather...um...black
[GMT 09/21/05 20:44:57] <terry-n43> Miss Piggy will tell me... she doesn't hold secrets from me
[GMT 09/21/05 20:45:49] <Jasmine-nrlp3> terry-n43-- mike black got it for us yesterday and gave it to Brad
[GMT 09/21/05 20:46:17] <terry-n43> GregStossmeister-Ops, the CD containing yesterdays AVAPS data was given to the scientists yesterday 
[GMT 09/21/05 20:46:33] <terry-n43> ahhhhh, I thought as much
[GMT 09/21/05 20:47:05] <GregStossmeister-Ops> terry-n43, OK Thanks Terry.
[GMT 09/21/05 20:47:09] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, you're right . . . the image is umm, quite black;  let's see what the next one looks like
[GMT 09/21/05 20:47:17] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> Brad, any suggestions for ftp'ing the radar packets off of Paul's machine?
[GMT 09/21/05 20:47:31] <Jasmine-nrlp3> StacyBrodzik-Ops-- ok, sounds good to me.  :-)
[GMT 09/21/05 20:48:09] <BradSmull-NRL> Dave--sorry, I'm at a loss--have never seen this behavior.
[GMT 09/21/05 20:48:28] <BradSmull-NRL> Maybe Paul can help us upon landing, tho I know crew will be anxious to get home tonite....
[GMT 09/21/05 20:48:45] <terry-n43> is there a problem with the current radar data being transmitted?
[GMT 09/21/05 20:48:46] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Can you give me an ETA on when you guys will be on the ground?
[GMT 09/21/05 20:48:49] <BradSmull-NRL> This difficulty is indicative of the high value of the dataset--this NEVER happens with crummy data!!
[GMT 09/21/05 20:48:52] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> do u have a login for the machine so I can see what directories are there?
[GMT 09/21/05 20:48:59] <terry-n43> thinks look nominal from this end
[GMT 09/21/05 20:49:12] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> We've started our descent into McDill
[GMT 09/21/05 20:49:24] <BradSmull-NRL> Dave--the only other suggestion I can offer is to wait until Terry secure's the radar and packets are no longer being recorded--perhaps that's part of the problem, tho I don't really think so
[GMT 09/21/05 20:49:55] <BradSmull-NRL> Paul or Terry may have one.... you could certainly try telnetting, logging in as windman with the same pasword as used for scp
[GMT 09/21/05 20:49:56] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> OK we're shutting them down now
[GMT 09/21/05 20:49:57] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- ETA, about 1 hour
[GMT 09/21/05 20:49:59] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, Can you give me an ETA on when you guys will be on the ground?
[GMT 09/21/05 20:50:12] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, Thx Jasmine.
[GMT 09/21/05 20:50:25] <BradSmull-NRL> Greg--one hour from now, conservatively
[GMT 09/21/05 20:50:34] <BradSmull-NRL> We hope to be faster
[GMT 09/21/05 20:50:37] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops--  you're very welcome, Greg

[GMT 09/21/05 20:57:49] <GregStossmeister-Ops> BradSmull-NRL, Jasmine-nrlp3 Let everyone know we will have a debrief/discussion of tomorrow's ops tonight at 6:15pm ok?
[GMT 09/21/05 20:58:19] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- got it!  Word shall be passed
[GMT 09/21/05 20:58:29] <BradSmull-NRL> well  I'm mystified Dave... did you try inserting the explicit filename you found into the scp command?
[GMT 09/21/05 20:58:40] <GregStossmeister-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, Thx
[GMT 09/21/05 20:59:14] <GregStossmeister-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43rf, Please tell the guys on 43 -debrief/discussion of tomorrow will happen at 615pm tonight.
[GMT 09/21/05 20:59:33] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> ok Greg
[GMT 09/21/05 20:59:46] <GregStossmeister-Ops> DaveJorgensen-n43rf, Thx.
[GMT 09/21/05 21:01:24] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> yes Brad I'm trying the explicit file name now
[GMT 09/21/05 21:02:02] <DaveJorgensen-n43rf> and it still says "No such file or directory" could there be a permission problem?
[GMT 09/21/05 21:02:38] <BradSmull-NRL> Dave--if Paul Chang is willing to help upon landing, that would be great. Or Terry, if he knows some other ins/outs for windman

[GMT 09/21/05 21:06:05] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Ok Stacy, Glad to see the composite images have been happier.  Seems every once in a while they decide to take a 10 minute vacation.

[GMT 09/21/05 21:10:06] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Ops--has NHC released their update on Rita?
[GMT 09/21/05 21:12:50] <JessicaKoury-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, I think so, and I think they've called it a Cat 5...but let me confirm that.
[GMT 09/21/05 21:13:23] Action: ChrisBurghart-Boulder is away: headed back to my office
[GMT 09/21/05 21:14:05] <JessicaKoury-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, Okay, that's confirmed, and they're estimating surface winds at 165 kts.
[GMT 09/21/05 21:14:25] <Jasmine-nrlp3> JessicaKoury-Ops-- thanks!
[GMT 09/21/05 21:14:59] <Jasmine-nrlp3> JessicaKoury-Ops-- I speak for everyone on NRL when I say OH, WOW

[GMT 09/21/05 21:16:21] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Ok.
[GMT 09/21/05 21:16:41] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Two Cat 5's for RAINEX....

[GMT 09/21/05 21:17:29] <JessicaKoury-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, correction, that's 165 mph (maximum sustained surface winds) 
[GMT 09/21/05 21:17:36] <JessicaKoury-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, (not knots!  sorry!)
[GMT 09/21/05 21:18:38] <Jasmine-nrlp3> That's Yes, that's a little different
[GMT 09/21/05 21:18:43] <Jasmine-nrlp3> but still impressive!!!
[GMT 09/21/05 21:23:27] <JessicaKoury-Ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, As far as landfall, it's still calling for the TX coastline, south of the Galvaston area.  Looks like New Orleans should be spared the worst of it! 
[GMT 09/21/05 21:24:38] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Ok, thaks for informing us up here!
[GMT 09/21/05 21:28:59] <Jasmine-nrlp3> NRL will land at 6 pm
[GMT 09/21/05 21:30:43] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Just kidding, NRL will land at 5:50
[GMT 09/21/05 21:30:49] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Ops-- my lies are compounding
[GMT 09/21/05 21:31:58] <BradSmull-NRL> Our margin of error is 15 min so Jasmine was ok.
[GMT 09/21/05 21:32:17] <Deanna-ops> Jasmine-nrlp3, to let you know all of our stuff was moved back to 502 by the CITG staff
[GMT 09/21/05 21:33:27] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Ok, that's awesome Deanna.  Glad you didn't have to do any heavy lifting!
[GMT 09/21/05 21:33:53] <Deanna-ops> Jess and I will make a tour of the apartment to make sure nothing was left
[GMT 09/21/05 21:35:20] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Deanna-ops-- many thanks!
