[GMT 09/20/05 16:39:47] <Tripoli-n43> We saw a sloppy eye, but good winds.
[GMT 09/20/05 16:40:18] <marks-hrd> I am glad you are having a good time - Naomi says hello from DC. I have her on the phone tight now.
[GMT 09/20/05 16:40:40] <Tripoli-n43> There was clearing on the SE side of the eye wall, subsidence apparently

[GMT 09/20/05 16:43:20] <Tripoli-n43> It is always humbling to view the multitude of scales involved behind the macro system.
[GMT 09/20/05 16:43:35] <marks-hrd> lots of little swirls in the center?
[GMT 09/20/05 16:43:55] <Tripoli-n43> What do you think? Shear affecting this?
[GMT 09/20/05 16:47:13] <marks-hrd> Just a little maybe from NE. Storm is propagating really fast to W about 11 kts. Saw 87 kt from SFMR on your first NW leg inbound. How was the ride?
[GMT 09/20/05 16:48:00] <Tripoli-n43> It was modeRatzely bumby..one major bumb in the eye wall..but not real severe.
[GMT 09/20/05 16:48:48] <marks-hrd> Still have lots of rainbands around Miami with thunder and some lightning. Good cells rolling though right now.
[GMT 09/20/05 16:48:50] <Tripoli-n43> You can really feel the sudeden increase of wind passing out of the eye.  That was impressive.
