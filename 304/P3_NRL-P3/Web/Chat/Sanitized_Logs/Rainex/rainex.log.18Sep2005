[GMT 09/18/05 15:47:15] <GregStossmeister-Hotel> Jasmine - Hi Jasmine - glad to know you are there. Did you guys leave at 11:00?
[GMT 09/18/05 15:47:35] <Jasmine-NRLP3> we took off at approx 11:15 am
[GMT 09/18/05 15:49:05] <GregStossmeister-Hotel> Jasmine - How's the flight going? Feel like a ranband mission in TD #18 on the way? (just kidding)
[GMT 09/18/05 15:50:07] <Jasmine-NRLP3> GregStossmeister-Hotel, Ha!  Flight is going well as of now

[GMT 09/18/05 15:56:10] <mblack-n43> We will probably know what the officia tasking is by the time we land

[GMT 09/18/05 16:36:15] <Jasmine-NRLP3> terry-n43-- I'm not in the ops center, but the images that I've been getting from there appear to have very old radar data.
[GMT 09/18/05 16:37:28] <terry-n43> dang... even when you aren't 'on the job' there... we can't get one by you
[GMT 09/18/05 16:38:04] <Jasmine-NRLP3> :-)  I'm always on the job.
[GMT 09/18/05 16:38:38] <terry-n43> a while back I turned off the 2nd Globalstar. I didn't think that anybody was in the ops center to process & upload it, etc
[GMT 09/18/05 16:39:05] <terry-n43> so I was just trying to save connection time and $$ if nobody was looking at it
[GMT 09/18/05 16:39:25] <terry-n43> but if y'all want it I'll be happy to start it back up again
[GMT 09/18/05 16:39:33] <Jasmine-NRLP3> I see.  It's automatically generated from there, so we were getting nice views of the ground clutter earlier.  Don't think we "need" it.
[GMT 09/18/05 16:41:00] <terry-n43> you're missing a stellar target of Andros Island right now... Yeah, the radar echoes are rather underwhelming
[GMT 09/18/05 16:41:34] <terry-n43> I didn't know the process from ROC was automated.. I thought it was hands on... pretty cool
[GMT 09/18/05 16:42:01] <terry-n43> Actually Cuba is showing up nicely as well
[GMT 09/18/05 16:42:03] <Jasmine-NRLP3> I suppose if you notice anything spectacular, it would be worth sending it back. Otherwise, saving some $$ might not be a bad idea!

[GMT 09/18/05 17:12:44] <Jasmine-NRLP3> images are only created for us on NRL every 10 minutes, (on the "twos"), and then it takes us about 2 minutes to upload them.
[GMT 09/18/05 17:13:02] <GregStossmeister-Hotel> Wen and Jasmine - Is the ldm error due to your g* dropout or do you think there is a more serious error
[GMT 09/18/05 17:13:46] <Jasmine-NRLP3> GregStossmeister-Hotel-- we've been on this entire time, so not likely due to anything on our end
[GMT 09/18/05 17:14:18] <GregStossmeister-Hotel> Jasmine - is this a consistent error or only occasional?
[GMT 09/18/05 17:14:44] <Jasmine-NRLP3> consistent.
[GMT 09/18/05 17:16:27] <terry-n43> i think 43 is going to have a 15z TO with a swipe through TD18/Rita and then recover MCF tomorrow...

[GMT 09/18/05 18:08:55] <mblack-n43> Been disconnected for awhile- any news on RAINEX plans??
[GMT 09/18/05 18:09:52] <GregStossmeister-Hotel> mblack - Will 5:00 work for you for conference call tonight? We still need it. NRL will return to McDill tomorrow. Discussion is whether they should fly with 43 or return straight home.
[GMT 09/18/05 18:10:32] <Jasmine-nrlp3> GregStossmeister-Hotel-- The issue is, do we want to fly another tropical storm?  Because it's 4 hours of flight time for us to head back to Tampa.  Maybe worth it to stay in St. Croix and extra day and wait to do a mission with 43 when there's a hurricane to fly?
[GMT 09/18/05 18:10:36] <mblack-n43> 5 PM might be tough- need to get off plane, travel to hotel and check in
[GMT 09/18/05 18:10:57] <Jasmine-nrlp3> Just something to think about before the conference call
[GMT 09/18/05 18:11:50] <mblack-n43> Should be landing about 3:15 PM-so should be able to be at Hotel by 4:30
[GMT 09/18/05 18:12:22] <mblack-n43> I don't think 43 will return to ST Croix after tomorrow's SFMR tasking- MacDill or Miami likely!!
[GMT 09/18/05 18:12:49] <GregStossmeister-Hotel> Jasmine - if TD18 becomes a hurricane current forecast is that won't happen til storm is near Florida Straits - that is forecast to be Tuesday and McDill is much closer. Of course everything is dependant on the accuracy of the forecast.
