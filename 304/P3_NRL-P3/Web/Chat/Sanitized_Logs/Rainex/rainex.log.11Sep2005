[GMT 09/11/05 15:32:26] <RobRogers-n43> mike, during our flight briefing this morning we discussed the possibility of needing to change altitude if there is icing (our current plan is to fly at 12 kft)
[GMT 09/11/05 15:32:45] <RobRogers-n43> if we need to descend, we'd like to come to 8 kft and have n42 go to 6 kft

[GMT 09/11/05 15:50:29] <DaveJorgensen-N43> Brad - towering cbs in the distance now visible out the front window and to our north

[GMT 09/11/05 15:51:08] <DaveJorgensen-N43> yep I see it

[GMT 09/11/05 15:52:38] <BradSmull-n43> Tech has no ETA for satcom transmission of LF at this point...
[GMT 09/11/05 15:52:39] <DaveJorgensen-N43> brad that's just off the edge of the LF horizon - many short bands in between now evident on LF
[GMT 09/11/05 15:53:08] <BradSmull-n43> Right Dave---I think eyewall is just coming into view on LF now, faintly
[GMT 09/11/05 15:53:24] <DaveJorgensen-N43> Brad - might be best to sync up NRL with N42 so their LF can help with NRL coordination if our LF transmission is out to lunch much longer
[GMT 09/11/05 15:53:55] <DaveJorgensen-N43> Brad - I'll play with the LF tilt a bit to see if I can maximize dbz in eyewall
[GMT 09/11/05 15:53:58] <BradSmull-n43> Dave: That's problematic, because NRL can't operate long after dark, and N42 T/O is delayed to correspond w/ sat overpass
[GMT 09/11/05 15:54:20] <BradSmull-n43> Jim: I recommend delaying NRL by 15 min
[GMT 09/11/05 15:54:25] <JimMoore-Ops> DaveJorgensen-N43, To be safe, lets delay NRL with hope of updating TO if you fix LF, OK?
[GMT 09/11/05 15:54:27] <DaveJorgensen-N43> OK I see
[GMT 09/11/05 15:54:31] <BradSmull-n43> Subject to futher updates
[GMT 09/11/05 15:54:49] <DaveJorgensen-N43> Brad - LF shows a hint of secondary eyewall formation
[GMT 09/11/05 15:55:14] <DaveJorgensen-N43> I wonder if Ophelia is going through an eye cycle and will start to deepen?
[GMT 09/11/05 15:56:47] <DaveJorgensen-N43> Brad - Inner eye  now plainly visible on LF Az is aoubt 050 range 340 km
[GMT 09/11/05 15:57:22] <BradSmull-n43> Dave: Our last trip into Ophelia on the 9th had just such a structure, i.e. small hook-shaped "inner eye" corresponding to SLP in off toward SW side of larger "eyewall" feature
[GMT 09/11/05 15:57:46] <ShuyiChen-opc> Dave, it's the outter bands getting more active since the the shear is lighten up. But, we don't have the sym inner eyewall or outer "eyewall" yet.
[GMT 09/11/05 15:58:19] <DaveJorgensen-N43> Brad - yep the inner eye has diameter of 40 km or so, outer ring of convection maybe 150 km dia or so
[GMT 09/11/05 15:59:08] <BradSmull-n43> NHC Center should now be near 056deg/340 km on LF
[GMT 09/11/05 15:59:13] <JimMoore-Ops> RobRogers-n43,  Can you give me Mike B. cell phone--to update NRL and 43 situation?
[GMT 09/11/05 15:59:18] <DaveJorgensen-N43> Brad - don't see much echo N of center yet, maybe too far away or perhaps attenuation going through inner and outer bands
[GMT 09/11/05 15:59:34] <ShuyiChen-opc> Rob & Brad, if you see a clear inner eyewall edges from LF, please follow the 9 sondes option in the figure 4.
[GMT 09/11/05 16:00:16] <BradSmull-n43> OK Shuyi--understood
[GMT 09/11/05 16:01:04] <JimMoore-Ops> BradSmull-n43, RobRogers-n43 We are delaying NRL in 15 min increments to see how LF repairs go
[GMT 09/11/05 16:01:25] <BradSmull-n43> Thx Jim- seems prudent. No further progress report here
[GMT 09/11/05 16:01:25] <DaveJorgensen-N43> Brad - inner eyewall is strongest dBZ  to N through E of center,, but clearly its circular eyewall
[GMT 09/11/05 16:02:00] <BradSmull-n43> Right Dave--fairly small diameter also, say 30 km??

[GMT 09/11/05 16:03:18] <DaveJorgensen-N43> Brad - I may have to raise LF tilt a bit as we approach - the sea clutter out to 200 km is killing me!
[GMT 09/11/05 16:03:34] <BradSmull-n43> Innermost eyewall appears open on SE side
[GMT 09/11/05 16:04:00] <BradSmull-n43> Dave: Fine by me, tho as we do our penetrations FD may have his own preferred tilt
[GMT 09/11/05 16:04:24] <BradSmull-n43> N43 is crossing broken outer band

[GMT 09/11/05 16:12:22] <BobHouze-Ops> mblack-n42, if 43 does not start transmitting, we will have to use 42 LF to guide NRL. 
[GMT 09/11/05 16:13:02] <BobHouze-Ops> mblack-n42, So we will have NRL t/o at same time as 42
[GMT 09/11/05 16:13:19] <BobHouze-Ops> mblack-n42, NRL's ip is 29.3/74.8

[GMT 09/11/05 16:21:23] <BradSmull-n43> south*WEST*
[GMT 09/11/05 16:21:35] <DaveJorgensen-N43> Brad, what I ID'ed before as outer circular eyewall is actually curved rainband that sprirals inward from the south - will probably be better defined on the N side as we go through eye
[GMT 09/11/05 16:21:39] <BradSmull-n43> (Please don't let it be another one of THOSE days... ugh)
[GMT 09/11/05 16:22:05] <BradSmull-n43> Dave - Yes, that was my point to Bob, a greater multiplicity of well-formed bands than we've seen before
[GMT 09/11/05 16:23:19] <DaveJorgensen-N43> Brad - winds now up to 59 knots 120 km from LF center
[GMT 09/11/05 16:24:14] <DaveJorgensen-N43> Brad - inner eye definately weaker in dBZ on SE side
[GMT 09/11/05 16:24:25] <BradSmull-n43> 'N43 is punching a second band
[GMT 09/11/05 16:24:43] <RobRogers-n43> FL winds spiked at 64 kt through that band
[GMT 09/11/05 16:24:50] <ShuyiChen-opc> Brad&Dave, the storm seems to evolve as model inticated earlier, less shear and more symm inner and outer bands as time goes on.
[GMT 09/11/05 16:24:53] <DaveJorgensen-N43> . . . and the seatbelt light isn't even on!
[GMT 09/11/05 16:25:20] <RobRogers-n43> but the model was showing an open eyewall on the north side wasn't it?
[GMT 09/11/05 16:25:29] <DaveJorgensen-N43> agree Shuyi
[GMT 09/11/05 16:26:01] <DaveJorgensen-N43> now punching the "outer" band ~100 km from center
[GMT 09/11/05 16:26:12] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-n43, NRL now is delayed till 1 pm
[GMT 09/11/05 16:26:15] <BradSmull-n43> Dave - Yes, eye appears closed, but weaker in E quadrant
[GMT 09/11/05 16:27:11] <DaveJorgensen-N43> winds spiking again to 60 knots - now dropping off to 50 knots on the inside edge - smells like an eyewall formation

[GMT 09/11/05 16:28:40] <BradSmull-n43> Shuyi - Our view of that side goes through eyewall, suffering some attenuation
[GMT 09/11/05 16:28:49] <DaveJorgensen-N43> Shuyi - hard to see very far to N through the inner eye, but dBZ's have definately gone up
[GMT 09/11/05 16:29:11] <DaveJorgensen-N43> Flight level winds now down to 45 knots!
[GMT 09/11/05 16:29:38] <BradSmull-n43> but yes, your interpretation seems reasonable. Most intense rainband returns on our scope are to south (band we came through ~15 min ago) and also about 200 km W-SW of center
[GMT 09/11/05 16:30:03] <DaveJorgensen-N43> only about 20 km from outer edge of inner eyewall

[GMT 09/11/05 18:04:26] <BobHouze-Ops> BradSmull-n43, you would pick which side you want to go N'bound

[GMT 09/11/05 19:19:48] <BradSmull-n43> Ops - Owing to our upwind status, it will take us aprox 22 min to reach vicinity 29.2/75.2
[GMT 09/11/05 19:20:55] <JimMoore-Ops> Melicie-NRLP3, Once beyond your present location things are better to the south-- stay as close as you can to the band on your right
