[GMT 08/25/05 17:19:30] <pavel-jeffco> Hi Janet, do you know what happened to ION?
[GMT 08/25/05 17:21:09] <anstett-tampa> Hi pavel, I was doing some testing yesterday to try and get rid of bad years in the data being sent.  There were some files that needed to be deleted in CO for ION to work.  All the data was there, just that ION was looking at the wrong file.

[GMT 08/25/05 17:28:11] <anstett-tampa> NRL is on the ground.  Eldora ready to go, waiting on maintenance on NRL.
[GMT 08/25/05 17:35:50] <pavel-jeffco> No wonder the altitude is 10 m and inertial is down.
