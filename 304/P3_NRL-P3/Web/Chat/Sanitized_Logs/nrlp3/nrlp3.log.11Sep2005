[GMT 09/11/05 18:27:12] <ads-nrlp3> I also noticed that the QC's did not agree on takeoff, but about 5 min into the flight it worked well now.

[GMT 09/11/05 20:23:05] <ads-nrlp3> Greg, I think that we mioght want to pull the phone again and charge it over night.  It seemed to do better on you flight even though it said it was charged this morning.
[GMT 09/11/05 20:24:48] <ads-nrlp3> The seas look rough out the window.  Lots of white caps visable.

[GMT 09/11/05 21:20:09] <MikeDaniels-minnesota> ads-nrlp3: ok, thanks.  have the chat reconnects also taken a long time?
[GMT 09/11/05 21:20:27] <MikeDaniels-minnesota> or is everything just related to frequent phone drop outs...

[GMT 09/11/05 22:15:54] <ads-nrlp3> Getting bumpy again. This is almost a C ticket ride <gron>
[GMT 09/11/05 22:20:27] <ads-nrlp3> Greg, we are still flying the storm. I would guess that we are still at least 3 hours from landing.
