[GMT 09/19/05 17:42:11] <GordonFarquharson-ncar> Jonathon, have you heard whether ELDORA is back online ?
[GMT 09/19/05 17:45:21] <GregStossmeister-Ops> GordonFarquharson-ncar, we talked to NRL via sat phone and they said eldora was back up.
[GMT 09/19/05 17:46:17] <GordonFarquharson-ncar> Thanks, Greg.
[GMT 09/19/05 17:46:21] <GregStossmeister-Ops> GordonFarquharson-ncar, They are rebooting to try and bring back communications right now.
[GMT 09/19/05 17:48:54] <GregStossmeister-Ops> GordonFarquharson-ncar, NRL says Iridium is down - Wen-Chau asks if Boulder can reboot.
[GMT 09/19/05 17:50:34] <GordonFarquharson-ncar> Reboot what ?
[GMT 09/19/05 17:51:16] <GregStossmeister-Ops> GordonFarquharson-ncar, Wen-Chau believes the ground station is down in Boulder. Can you look into that or contact the right person to check?
[GMT 09/19/05 17:51:47] <GordonFarquharson-ncar> Okay, we'll contact Mike Daniels.
[GMT 09/19/05 17:52:33] <GregStossmeister-Ops> GordonFarquharson-ncar, Thanks Gordon.
[GMT 09/19/05 17:52:34] <GordonFarquharson-ncar> Charlie Martin is finding out how to do this.
[GMT 09/19/05 17:53:22] <GregStossmeister-Ops> GordonFarquharson-ncar, Thanks- they've been out of touch for almost 40 minutes.
[GMT 09/19/05 18:01:42] <GordonFarquharson-ncar> Hi Greg, Charlie and I have tried to conact Mike Daniels, Janet, Anstett, and Chris Burghart, but they aren't available. We have left messages on both their land-line and cell phones. Hopefully on of them will look into the problem soon.
[GMT 09/19/05 18:02:20] <GordonFarquharson-ncar> Unfortunately, there isn't much more that we can do right now.
[GMT 09/19/05 18:12:18] <GregStossmeister-Ops> GordonFarquharson-ncar, Thanks for your help - Chris got the message.
