[08/17/05 18:48:28] <mikestrong> hi, what was wrong with the forward tx?
[08/17/05 18:50:48] <EldoraOp-P3> Mike, it's Kyle, we had powerup problems with the fore tx.  Same as yesterday.  Kept trying and it finally came up.
[08/17/05 18:51:49] <EldoraOp-P3> What time do you want to get up tomorrow?
[08/17/05 18:52:03] <mikestrong> did the green power up light come on the 36 module?
[08/17/05 18:52:29] <EldoraOp-P3> it flashed for a second but not solid
[08/17/05 18:53:05] <mikestrong> i will try to locate a module in our spares if eric thinks we have one.
[08/17/05 18:53:52] <mikestrong> i thought getting up at 8:30, like today, would be nice.
[08/17/05 18:54:06] <EldoraOp-P3> he mentioned he saw some modules in the tx box but not sure if module 36
[08/17/05 18:54:24] <EldoraOp-P3> I'll discuss the time and get back with you
[08/17/05 18:55:41] <mikestrong> just kidding, if we need to do some serious work on the system tomorrow, or any day, i like to get started early.. like leaving at 6:30
[08/17/05 18:56:58] <mikestrong> would it be worth a call to al? ask him if he knows if we have that module?
[08/17/05 19:00:16] <EldoraOp-P3> eric says, 8:30 in the garage, power on at 9:30.  try and locate that 15v power supply module, if we have one, and a call to al wouldn't hurt.
