However, that said we can talk by voice and they are getting excellent data

[GMT 09/22/05 20:09:53] <LarryMurphy-Tampa> Do you think that it did not work as well when you were closer to the center. Could it have something to do with the turn angles?
[GMT 09/22/05 20:10:10] <ads-nrlp3> Larry,BTW The battery level strenght indicator still show 3 full bars up to now
[GMT 09/22/05 20:10:59] <LarryMurphy-Tampa> Yeah, I no longer think that it is a battery problem.
