[GMT 08/22/05 16:06:43] <ChrisBurghart-ops> I think they are having a hard time keeping net communications connected.  Tracks from them have been very inconsistent.

[GMT 08/22/05 16:13:04] <BradSmull-n43> N43 is turning N. Plan to repeat this box as problems are being worked on both aircraft
[GMT 08/22/05 16:13:43] <BradSmull-n43> (Per above--VHF coms have been established between NRL & N43 scientists)
[GMT 08/22/05 16:14:56] <pavel-jeffco> We had a hint that P43's radar altimeter might be the cause of interference with Iridium. Is there a chance it could be turned off to test this?
[GMT 08/22/05 16:16:31] <terry-n43> the APN-159 on 43 is off at this time
[GMT 08/22/05 16:16:35] <BradSmull-n43> Pavel- N43 switched transmit freq on scientific radar altimeter from 151 to 232 about 30 minutes ago

[GMT 08/22/05 16:25:53] <pavel-jeffco> The explanation we had from Jeff at NOAA was that the 43's radar altimeter is the older APN159 on the P3 is putting out so much power that the Iridium system NOAA flies lost connection any time the altimeter would be turned on, regardless of anything else.
[GMT 08/22/05 16:26:38] <BradSmull-n43> Pavel- Understood, but NOAA's 159 is switched OFF and has been for over 45 minutes

[GMT 08/22/05 16:29:10] <anstett-tampa> Just got a call from Charlie on the NRL P3 and he is going to try changing some options on the Iridium connect script to get the Iridium link up.

[GMT 08/22/05 16:44:36] <Melicie-NRLP3> brad are you putting LF or tail ?
[GMT 08/22/05 16:44:37] <ChrisBurghart-ops> I'm having issues putting things into the LDM queue.  I'll try to stuff an image by hand...

[GMT 08/22/05 16:46:23] <BradSmull-n43> Melicie: Our LF & Tail radars are working properly, but networking necessary to put them onto satcom is not.
[GMT 08/22/05 16:46:24] <BobHouze-ops> brad: Yes I agree Terry should keep working the problem there.
[GMT 08/22/05 16:46:33] <BradSmull-n43> Will do.
[GMT 08/22/05 16:46:40] <Melicie-NRLP3> seems like we have a stablble connection now
[GMT 08/22/05 16:46:58] <Melicie-NRLP3> send us  something to test
[GMT 08/22/05 16:47:10] <ChrisBurghart-ops> Working on it.
[GMT 08/22/05 16:47:13] <ads-nrlp3> pavel/johncowan this is bill, up on nrl p-3, many problems getting ion to stay connected, charliemartin and janet switched some numbers on ion so actracker would respond faster for phone shutdowns, that seemed to kill ion link as soon as anyone here on p-3 hooked on to xchat
[GMT 08/22/05 16:47:39] <pavel-jeffco> I see. Seems to work now.
[GMT 08/22/05 16:47:46] <ads-nrlp3> numbers switched back now, and working much better, we've been up almost 7 minutes now
[GMT 08/22/05 16:47:49] <ChrisBurghart-ops> Melicie-NRLP3: there should be an image coming up now.  The location is incorrect, so it's not very interesting.
[GMT 08/22/05 16:48:54] <Melicie-NRLP3> got it thanks
[GMT 08/22/05 16:49:23] <BradSmull-n43> 43RF is turning S. Lots of ~small echoes developing mainly to N of our box.
[GMT 08/22/05 16:49:57] <Melicie-NRLP3> Chris time of the file is 1248
[GMT 08/22/05 16:50:32] <ChrisBurghart-ops> Is that the image time in the upper left corner, or the time you received it?
[GMT 08/22/05 16:50:45] <ChrisBurghart-ops> Or the time in the file name?
[GMT 08/22/05 16:51:46] <Melicie-NRLP3> it the time of the file name
[GMT 08/22/05 16:52:50] <BobHouze-ops> brad: cells north of you are strengthening but still small
[GMT 08/22/05 16:53:36] <BradSmull-n43> Agreed. They are sufficient for Paul Willis' purposes, however. Most cells in our area appear to be "streeting" in ~E-W bands.

[GMT 08/22/05 16:59:13] <ads-nrlp3> pavel, two things, one we shot ourself trying to help us see when link would go down, by sending echo signal every couple of seconds to ground and waiting  only couple of seconds for it to return, when it couldn't make the round trip in that time limit, software would shut the ion link down...then today's test flight has us flying 20nm from noaa43, and rf interference is greatly lessened at this distance...that's what i've observed today
[GMT 08/22/05 16:59:45] <BobHouze-ops> 1300 call in meeting is postponed till a/c have landed
[GMT 08/22/05 17:00:08] <wen-nrlp3> Chris, on the next test, can you include the time (real time) you hit return so we can tell how long does it take to get up here.
[GMT 08/22/05 17:00:47] <BradSmull-n43> NRL currently N-bound; N43 now turning N-bound
[GMT 08/22/05 17:00:57] <ChrisBurghart-ops> Will do, Wen.  It will take a minute or two.
[GMT 08/22/05 17:03:11] <pavel-jeffco> Bill - N43 has their APN159 is turned off. This is probably helping. I am glad you guys were able to find the reason in flight - thank you and Charlie!
[GMT 08/22/05 17:03:28] <anstett-tampa> ads-nrlp3: NOAA 43 has had their radar altimeter turned off since shortly after takeoff.
[GMT 08/22/05 17:03:47] <Melicie-NRLP3> brad I want to talk to try to talk to u
[GMT 08/22/05 17:04:19] <BradSmull-n43> Melicie--in chat or on radio?
[GMT 08/22/05 17:04:32] <Melicie-NRLP3> radio
[GMT 08/22/05 17:04:39] <BradSmull-n43> Go ahead--I'm on.
[GMT 08/22/05 17:05:21] <ads-nrlp3> pavel/janet, yes, i'm sure that's helping, chris burghart is sending us tracks and images, seems like they get to us in a minute or so
[GMT 08/22/05 17:05:36] <ChrisBurghart-ops> Wen, image inserted in queue at 17:05:30
[GMT 08/22/05 17:05:56] <ChrisBurghart-ops> Image size is 10275 bytes
[GMT 08/22/05 17:06:26] <ChrisBurghart-ops> Sorry, image was not inserted that time.
[GMT 08/22/05 17:07:11] <ChrisBurghart-ops> Image inserted in queue at 17:07:00.
[GMT 08/22/05 17:07:15] <BradSmull-n43> Bob - Lynch is still troubleshooting, says it could be 30-sec or 30-min. He also said this troubleshooting could be done on the ground.
[GMT 08/22/05 17:09:05] <BradSmull-n43> N43 is going to extend this W-bound track to punch a cell for Paul Willis' benefit
[GMT 08/22/05 17:09:31] <CharlieMartin-nrlp3> image is here
[GMT 08/22/05 17:09:50] <BobHouze-ops> brad: ok, that sounds like a good use of time to get Paul's data while Terry is working.
[GMT 08/22/05 17:10:37] <BradSmull-n43> Agreed.
[GMT 08/22/05 17:10:41] <BobHouze-ops> I would like to give Terry a little more time to get this solved in the air. We need to do this test in flight.
[GMT 08/22/05 17:11:25] <wen-nrlp3> Chris: we received the image around 17:09. 
[GMT 08/22/05 17:11:35] <ChrisBurghart-ops> Roughly 4000 KB/minute for image transfer.  Since images will be closer to 20-30 KB when we have LF radar data on them, it should take ~5-7 minutes per image.
[GMT 08/22/05 17:12:55] <wen-nrlp3> Chris, can you send us one from last test flight that has ground in it. That may be close enough.
[GMT 08/22/05 17:13:29] <ChrisBurghart-ops> BTW, Charlie, good job on the Iridium fix!
[GMT 08/22/05 17:13:36] <ChrisBurghart-ops> Will send another image in a minute.

[GMT 08/22/05 17:23:29] <BobHouze-ops> Brad & Wen: Plan to land in about half an hour. 
[GMT 08/22/05 17:24:07] <BobHouze-ops> Brad: Will Terry be continuing to work on the radar transmission on the way back in? If so, we might get lucky and get at list one shot at a test.
