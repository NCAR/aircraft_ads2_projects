[GMT 08/27/05 14:11:22] <BradSmull-n43> We have very clear depictions of closed center and principal rainband
[GMT 08/27/05 14:12:17] <BradSmull-n43> But of course LF data are going to be compromised in reacetrack turns - will advise when I know more
[GMT 08/27/05 14:14:12] <BradSmull-n43> Proceeding toward Katrina. Problem isolated to cockpit nose radar display, which will be inop for remainder of flight. Will complcate flight-director/flight coordination, but ~doable
[GMT 08/27/05 14:18:30] <houze_ops> brad: on the NRL coordinated leg can you scan the tail Doppler on one side?
[GMT 08/27/05 14:19:29] <BradSmull-n43> LF now suggesting possibility of double eyewall structure. Bringing LF tilt up to 3, but flight is relying heavily on LF today so it's their call
[GMT 08/27/05 14:20:13] <BradSmull-n43> Yes Bob, we can do that, though I'm not sure it's a tremendous advantage for our analysis. But if you like, sure.
[GMT 08/27/05 14:20:45] <RRogers> we may be in the middle of a band on our downwind leg, so would we want TA on both sides of a/c?
[GMT 08/27/05 14:21:07] <RRogers> btw NHC estimated center point at 15Z 24 deg 30 min N
[GMT 08/27/05 14:21:14] <RRogers> 85 deg 06 min W
[GMT 08/27/05 14:21:20] <houze_ops> brad: I think the Key West 88D also suggest double eyewall, but shuyi is not sure.
[GMT 08/27/05 14:22:00] <houze_ops> rob & brad: I think I agree with you, just plan to scan both sides for now.
[GMT 08/27/05 14:22:18] <RRogers> ok
[GMT 08/27/05 14:24:25] <houze_ops> brad & rob: the double side scanning is important because the principle band will actully be to your left. The NRL will be working the outer band.
[GMT 08/27/05 14:25:10] <RRogers> yeah it's pretty sloppy on this side, and I figure we'll be in most of the slop during that downwind leg
[GMT 08/27/05 14:25:17] <BradSmull-n43> Understood.
[GMT 08/27/05 14:25:30] <houze_ops> agreed
[GMT 08/27/05 14:28:02] <RRogers> i'm asking the FD to see if we have the flexibility to extend our legs past 105 nm if we need to better coordinate
[GMT 08/27/05 14:28:12] <RRogers> he's going to check on that
[GMT 08/27/05 14:28:34] <houze_ops> ok
[GMT 08/27/05 14:29:19] <houze_ops> brad & rob: 
[GMT 08/27/05 14:29:48] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> Terry, the lf data stream has stopped
[GMT 08/27/05 14:29:49] <houze_ops> the inner eyewall seems to be shrinking down 
[GMT 08/27/05 14:30:06] <RRogers> it may be undergoing eyewall replacement cycle
[GMT 08/27/05 14:30:57] <houze_ops> yes--seems like it
[GMT 08/27/05 14:33:36] <BradSmull-n43> By my estimate, principal band northern end is near 25deg00min 84deg07min
[GMT 08/27/05 14:34:04] <terry-43> if lf still stopped?
[GMT 08/27/05 14:34:05] <RRogers> so brad where would IP be for NRL?
[GMT 08/27/05 14:34:09] <BradSmull-n43> and is about 20 nm (37 km) distant from outwall as measured along the 45 deg radial
[GMT 08/27/05 14:34:39] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> Terry, Yes, lf data is still not coming in.  last data came at 1417

[GMT 08/27/05 14:37:30] <BradSmull-n43> Thinking about your question, Rob-- N end of *outer* band that Bob is suggesting they work is near 20 nm at 130 deg from our present position

[GMT 08/27/05 15:16:49] <houze_ops> brad: the slight rise in prssure is consistent with the eyewall replacement cycle
[GMT 08/27/05 15:16:50] <MikeDaniels-home> Cai-NRLP3: essentially, yes, but the exact problem is that the bandwidth is being used fully and the chat client and chat server's ability to communicate is being affected 
[GMT 08/27/05 15:16:56] <Cai-NRLp3> Brad, LF or tail?
[GMT 08/27/05 15:17:03] <BradSmull-n43rf> Indeed.  Cai: Both.
[GMT 08/27/05 15:17:30] <BradSmull-n43rf> We are orbiting until it's back up owing to Pilot's reliance on LF in place of nose display
[GMT 08/27/05 15:17:48] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> Cai-NRLp3, fyi, there seems to be a correlation between your comm dropouts and failure of our images to be centered on your location.  
[GMT 08/27/05 15:18:24] <Cai-NRLp3> Mike, as long as the image transfer is least affected, a longer reconnection time may be acceptable
[GMT 08/27/05 15:19:39] <houze_ops> nrl p3 is at ABOUT 29N 81W
[GMT 08/27/05 15:19:44] <MikeDaniels-home> Cai-NRLP3: that is the trade-off.  We can work in boulder to reduce the bandwidth that the image transfer can use which will speed up chat reconnects, but then that will affect the speed of the image transfers.
[GMT 08/27/05 15:20:08] <BradSmull-n43rf> Ops & NRL - Be advised that due to extra work in marking center, our arrival on E side will be delayed to 1615 or even 1630
[GMT 08/27/05 15:20:26] <Cai-NRLp3> Stacy, when Iridium drops out for a while, you don't have our location info. May be that is the problem for the decorrelation.
[GMT 08/27/05 15:21:01] <MikeDaniels-home> Cai-NRLP3: Yes, that must be the problem.  No point to center the image on.
[GMT 08/27/05 15:21:55] <Deanna-nrlp3> right now the lf retrieval has been taking about 2 minutes
[GMT 08/27/05 15:22:00] <MikeDaniels-home> I suppose it could just use the last known good point in that case
[GMT 08/27/05 15:22:26] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> Cai and Mike, as long as everyone is aware of the problem and it doesn't get worse, I think we can live with it.
[GMT 08/27/05 15:22:36] <MikeDaniels-home> ok.
[GMT 08/27/05 15:23:46] <Cai-NRLp3> Mike, the image seems to arrive within 3-5 min without the LF data. It will take longer with LF. So, I don't think reducing the image bandwidth is a good idea.

[GMT 08/27/05 15:27:43] <Cai-NRLp3> Stacy, if you look at the 15:12 image, the image is not centered on the NRL location. However, this suggests that you are using a very old postion for this image ( I mean computer used).

[GMT 08/27/05 15:30:02] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> Cai, I noticed that too.  However if your sat link was down for 8 minutes, that might account for that very old position
[GMT 08/27/05 15:30:13] <Cai-NRLp3> Bob, yes, just got that from Brad. So we will do something by ourselves for about two hours. NRL should arrive IP about 1615.
[GMT 08/27/05 15:31:32] <Cai-NRLp3> Stacy, however, the track of NRL should not be presented on the image past that point.
[GMT 08/27/05 15:32:01] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> Cai, unless the center is determined first and then some track info arrives before the plot...
[GMT 08/27/05 15:32:15] <houze_ops> deanna, wen: We can guide you using the Key West radar. We'll work up some way points
[GMT 08/27/05 15:32:47] <BradSmull-n43rf> N43 still spiraling -not quite sure what the hold-up is
[GMT 08/27/05 15:32:59] <Cai-NRLp3> Stacy, yes, that make sense.
[GMT 08/27/05 15:33:13] <Cai-NRLp3> Bob, standby.
[GMT 08/27/05 15:34:22] <Deanna-nrlp3> stacy, the 15:32 image's positioning hasn't improved
[GMT 08/27/05 15:34:42] <Deanna-nrlp3> plane's position isn't in the image anymore
[GMT 08/27/05 15:34:55] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> Deanna, I've noted that . . . will continue to monitor the situation

[GMT 08/27/05 15:35:12] <Deanna-nrlp3> ok
[GMT 08/27/05 15:35:44] <MikeDaniels-home> Cai-NRLP3: One thing we could try wrt chat reconnects and LF data xfer is to delay the *start* of LF image transfers once the irirdium reconnects.  This would allow the chat clients to reconnect more quickly, but would not affect the rest of the image transfers.  We would want to make sure that it doesn't mean that we would have a backlog of images that need to be sent, though.

[GMT 08/27/05 15:53:52] <BradSmull-n43rf> Bob - we realize you passed way-points to NRL. Please clarify what their track would be following?
[GMT 08/27/05 15:53:52] <BradSmull-n43rf> Proposal to do closer coord between NRL & NOAA beginning at our arrival at 1630, rather than the later arrival mentioned previously

[GMT 08/27/05 15:54:47] <houze_ops> brad: we have given way points to nrl to use up a couple of hours while you fly your prescribed pattern.
[GMT 08/27/05 15:54:56] <RRogers> extending downwind along rainband -- arrival at this point at around 1630 UTC

[GMT 08/27/05 15:55:28] <RRogers> of course that would require NRL to be on SE side sometime around 1630 UTC
[GMT 08/27/05 15:55:29] <houze_ops> we were expecting you to be ready to coordinate at 1815 as per previous chat
[GMT 08/27/05 15:55:32] <BradSmull-n43rf> I undestand, Bob--we're offering you an "earlier" option on SE side
[GMT 08/27/05 15:55:43] <BradSmull-n43rf> you don't need to take it--just an option
[GMT 08/27/05 15:56:00] <RRogers> we're just proposing possibility of an addtional coordinated pass
[GMT 08/27/05 15:56:06] <houze_ops> give us a little time to figure this out. We did not know you had the flixeibility
[GMT 08/27/05 15:56:16] <RRogers> ok
[GMT 08/27/05 15:56:27] <houze_ops> ok brad & rob: we are going to hustle up a new plan
[GMT 08/27/05 15:56:33] <RRogers> ok great
[GMT 08/27/05 15:56:58] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> Terry, we're still not getting any lf data
[GMT 08/27/05 15:57:22] <houze_ops> brad & rob:
[GMT 08/27/05 15:57:46] <BradSmull-n43rf> Thanks Bob- sorry for inconvenience, we're just trying to recover from our unplanned delay.
[GMT 08/27/05 15:57:50] <houze_ops> we would like to stick to the original plan. The se quadrant is too messy for NRL's first go at a storm. 
[GMT 08/27/05 15:57:57] <Deanna-nrlp3> have begun descent to 8000
[GMT 08/27/05 15:58:10] <RRogers> ok
[GMT 08/27/05 15:58:35] <houze_ops> We will work them on the NE side using Key West until you arrive at point due east of center at 1815
[GMT 08/27/05 15:58:35] <RRogers> i passed that on to the FD
[GMT 08/27/05 15:59:00] <mblack-hrd> can anyone tell me what the URl is to look at in-flight products?
[GMT 08/27/05 15:59:10] <RRogers> nrl is at 8000 ft is that correct?

[GMT 08/27/05 16:00:53] <mblack-hrd> thanks, are they normally on the operational  products page?
[GMT 08/27/05 16:01:06] <RRogers> ok thanks

[GMT 08/27/05 16:08:18] <terry-n43> ok, lf is back up
[GMT 08/27/05 16:08:23] <Jasmine-ops> the cell is moving to the NW, so you should curve around it

[GMT 08/27/05 16:12:08] <BradSmull-n43rf> Stacy - Terry's read is that these interuptions have resulted from an (unlucky) chain of unrelated events. Hopefully we'll do better as we work toward NRL's side of storm.
[GMT 08/27/05 16:12:45] <houze_ops> lf looks much better at the higher tilt

[GMT 08/27/05 16:24:04] <BradSmull-n43rf> Here on SE side of storm, LF shows multiple, relatively straight bands seoparated by 30 km or so
[GMT 08/27/05 16:24:50] <houze_ops> brad: probably large radius of curvature
[GMT 08/27/05 16:25:20] <houze_ops> mike d: I tried to get them to do a large radius turn but didn't get the message out in time
[GMT 08/27/05 16:25:29] <BradSmull-n43rf> PI's: We need to discuss (de-brief) which of these various bands would be a nominal priority for (1) science, and (2) for NRL coordination, on a more practical level
[GMT 08/27/05 16:25:56] <BradSmull-n43rf> My own interpretation is that the "principal band" is the one closest to the eywall (and basically tangent to it), but not sure it's practical to get NRL tucked in there
[GMT 08/27/05 16:26:09] <MikeDaniels-home> Bob: I saw that in the nrlp3 room, too...

[GMT 08/27/05 17:49:25] <BradSmull-n43> Bob - be advised that flight deck has both of our LF displays zoomed up, so it's not too practical for me to set points for NRL today. Assume you're comfortable to do that?

[GMT 08/27/05 18:00:02] <houze_ops> 1833 is what we got as eta for origingal eastern end point. I thought  24/83 would be a little different
[GMT 08/27/05 18:01:09] <houze_ops> understood, brad. We have a little time here, but beefore too long we need to give nrl time to arrive at their first point.

[GMT 08/27/05 19:03:19] <houze_ops> :)
[GMT 08/27/05 19:04:01] <BradSmull-n43rf> More seriously: Bob, the LF data in this environment have not been too well defined from Rob's/My perspective. The outer banded structures seem clearer up here to the north. We woudl have been hard-pressed to set up the pattern you did given our zoomed-in LF radar
[GMT 08/27/05 19:04:23] <BradSmull-n43rf> Another very interesting RAINEX target would be the "new" outer eyewall... tho not so practical from NRL's perpsective

[GMT 08/27/05 19:10:10] <BradSmull-n43rf> Shuyi--our crossings of (old) inner and (new) outer eyewalls have been quite distinct ever since our initial transit of the storm.

[GMT 08/27/05 19:12:13] <ShuyiChen-opc> Brad, the old inner eyewall keeps going with new convection on the south side. It's an interesting feature we have not seen before.

[GMT 08/27/05 19:46:58] <marks-hrd> Brad - Why did you guys go E-W N of the center on that last pass?
[GMT 08/27/05 19:47:46] <Wen-NRLP3> Ops, the line has a top ~11 km and a bright band about 5 km.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:48:02] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Frank - because the principal band curved to become tangent to the N side of the new (outer) eyewall
[GMT 08/27/05 19:49:03] <marks-hrd> But weren't you supposed to get a fix on that pass (1847-1907). Looked like you went to the storms longitude and then tracked due N.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:49:58] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Frank: our fixes at 15, 18 were completed, then RAINEX pattern was inserted, and now we're in process of obtaining 21 UTC fix (i.e. post 20UTC)
[GMT 08/27/05 19:52:49] <BradSmull-NOAA43> Insertion of RAINEX module invovled minor changes to figure 4, namely (1) a ca. 25 nm extension of our NHC-mandated e-bound leg (along which we obtained the 18 UTC fix) and (2) change of subsequent downwind leg to a more curvilinear track.
[GMT 08/27/05 19:52:58] <Wen-NRLP3> Ops, the south point of the current NRL leg is 26 miles N of Havanna, we will cut short of the leg and return north.

[GMT 08/27/05 20:56:35] <science2-nrlp3> Brad, do you see a big hole on your LF data surrounding your plane (something like 50 km radius roughly?
[GMT 08/27/05 20:59:41] <science2-nrlp3> Brad, is it possible that 43 is flying in clear region and all we see now is sea clutter at long range.
[GMT 08/27/05 20:59:52] <Deanna-nrlp3> we're done....heading to mcdill
[GMT 08/27/05 20:59:55] <BradSmull-n43rf> Yes. I can explain it to you later. Who is asking the question?
[GMT 08/27/05 21:00:13] <BradSmull-n43rf> 43 will be on-deck at 2110, barring weather delays into MCF
[GMT 08/27/05 21:00:16] <Deanna-nrlp3> it's wen-chau
[GMT 08/27/05 21:00:19] <science2-nrlp3> Wen
[GMT 08/27/05 21:00:53] <BradSmull-n43rf> Sure Wen-chau. Basic principle is this: LF beam is a fan beam, spreading vertically up (but more importantly *down*) from aircraft with range.
[GMT 08/27/05 21:01:23] <BradSmull-n43rf> So it approximates a cone. And because of our altitude, the beam strikes the surface beyone a certain range.
[GMT 08/27/05 21:02:18] <BradSmull-n43rf> Essentiallyo it's a problem in conic sections--the intersection of a cone (our beam) and a plane (the earth's surface). It results in some strange artifacts.
[GMT 08/27/05 21:02:33] <BradSmull-n43rf> Including the appearance of a parabola-shaped return when we are in steep turns.
[GMT 08/27/05 21:02:38] <BradSmull-n43rf> Does that explanation help?
[GMT 08/27/05 21:02:49] <science2-nrlp3> Brad, that is important for me to get used to. That is another reason 43 cannot be too far away from NRL in formation.
[GMT 08/27/05 21:03:11] <mblack-hrd> Is there any sign of the inner eyewall collapsing and is the wind max at the outer?
[GMT 08/27/05 21:03:19] <BradSmull-n43rf> Yes Wen-Chau... there are *many* peculiarities of LF data--it's literally taken me years to get used to it.
[GMT 08/27/05 21:03:48] <BradSmull-n43rf> Mike - we saw double wind maxima, with the outer band generally having the stronger one (at least on our final trip out through the NE quadrant)
[GMT 08/27/05 21:04:00] <science2-nrlp3> Brad, I saw the pattern when NOAA P3 turns, but have not experienced sea clutter on LF before.
[GMT 08/27/05 21:04:08] <BradSmull-n43rf> Crossing the skyway bridge--we'll be on-deck shortly
[GMT 08/27/05 21:05:06] <BradSmull-n43rf> Lots of people can imis-interpret LF. I got asked question early in flight if we were sector scanning LF (which I have never seen done), and it was merely the result of being in a steep/continuous banking turn as we orbited, yielding a parabolic (sector-shaped) echo return from intersection of beam with ocean surface
[GMT 08/27/05 21:05:18] <BradSmull-n43rf> And that's your enviro-minute  ;-)
[GMT 08/27/05 21:06:32] <Deanna-nrlp3> ops, we are only about 25 mins out of tampa
[GMT 08/27/05 21:06:52] <BradSmull-n43rf> Anyway Wen, the main thing is to think of LF scans not as a disk, but as a fan (or if one considers only the lower edge of the scan, a cone)
[GMT 08/27/05 21:07:10] <jose_rainex> Brad- can you get YESTERDAYS drops from SED or Barry?
[GMT 08/27/05 21:07:33] <mblack-hrd> do we have a time set yet for the debrief conf call?
[GMT 08/27/05 21:07:54] <BradSmull-n43rf> Ummmm, we didn't fly yesterday. And Stacy already has the ones from our MIA-landfall flight
[GMT 08/27/05 21:08:08] <jose_rainex> high res D files?
[GMT 08/27/05 21:08:11] <science2-nrlp3> Brad, hard to imaging 43 is not inside a hurricane. That threw me off for a while.
[GMT 08/27/05 21:08:38] <BradSmull-n43rf> she has all of them , I believe. In fact she was asking me last night what all the various files off the CD meant and I referred her to *you*. Surprised she didn't ask you.
[GMT 08/27/05 21:08:50] <jose_rainex> she hasn't shared
[GMT 08/27/05 21:08:52] <BradSmull-n43rf> But if something got left behind, call me and I'll get it for you.
[GMT 08/27/05 21:09:03] <BradSmull-n43rf> On short final Runway 040
[GMT 08/27/05 21:09:17] <jose_rainex> debrief is 30mins after last plane lands
[GMT 08/27/05 21:09:29] <BradSmull-n43rf> Landed.
