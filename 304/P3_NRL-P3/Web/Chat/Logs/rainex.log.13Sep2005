[GMT 09/13/05 16:33:45] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Yep
[GMT 09/13/05 16:34:38] <science3-nrlp3> nick /wen
[GMT 09/13/05 16:35:02] <science3-nrlp3> I probably used the wrong command
[GMT 09/13/05 16:35:12] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Try "/nick wen"
[GMT 09/13/05 16:36:00] <science3-nrlp3> Anyway, I am uploading images manually. I will load different images in the next 30-40 min and see what happens
[GMT 09/13/05 16:36:25] Nick change: science3-nrlp3 -> Wen
[GMT 09/13/05 16:38:54] <Wen> At the end of this test in about 40 min, I would like to get the LDM turned on to see if Iridium goes nut.  So far so good.
[GMT 09/13/05 16:55:35] <Wen> Chris: If we end up manually upload images, how would that change the display in the cockpit? Is there a directory we need to put the images?
[GMT 09/13/05 16:56:25] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Mike and Janet set up the plane side of things.  I'll go ask Mike.
[GMT 09/13/05 16:57:50] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Mike is busy right now, so I can't ask.  I'm pretty sure there is just a simple directory where the images end up,  and a script that creates a special link to the latest image.
[GMT 09/13/05 17:00:32] <Wen> Chris: Interestingly, when I tried to upload 2 images from two different IE windows, only one uploads and other one shows "This page cannot be displayed". So far, there is no dropout. 
[GMT 09/13/05 17:01:08] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Are both images being uploaded from the same source?
[GMT 09/13/05 17:01:21] <Wen> Chat and image upload are not conflicting. 
[GMT 09/13/05 17:03:03] <Wen> Different directories
[GMT 09/13/05 17:03:15] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> I think they are conflicting somewhat.  A timing test would be interesting.  Do you have a (synchronized) clock running that shows seconds?
[GMT 09/13/05 17:04:26] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> This line is being sent at exactly 17:04:45.
[GMT 09/13/05 17:04:28] <Wen> Do you mean on Windows?
[GMT 09/13/05 17:05:04] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Yes, or just access to an accurate clock somewhere on the plane.
[GMT 09/13/05 17:05:13] <pavel-jeffco> Chris, latest image in that directory is called "current.jpg", and then they are renamed, so there's no script.

[GMT 09/13/05 17:05:51] <Wen> When I say conflicting, I mean they don't kill the phone. Certainly they are conflicting in terms of the bandwidth.
[GMT 09/13/05 17:06:20] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Thanks Pavel.  Do you know the directory, and how the renaming is happening?
[GMT 09/13/05 17:07:21] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Wen: I would like to quantify what sort of round-trip time we're getting from chat while you are uploading images.
[GMT 09/13/05 17:08:38] <Wen> Chris, I can see hh:mm on my chat window, how to configure the time to show ss.
[GMT 09/13/05 17:09:32] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Actually, I don't know if the message times are being generated by the client or by the server.  Instead, I'm 
[GMT 09/13/05 17:09:35] <Wen> Chris, I found it. now I have seconds on display.
[GMT 09/13/05 17:09:54] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> curious to know what time you get a given message based on a *separate* clock.
[GMT 09/13/05 17:10:42] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> That should read: a separate and *accurate* clock.
[GMT 09/13/05 17:12:20] <Wen> test
[GMT 09/13/05 17:13:28] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> To explain further:  I'll send a message like "this message being sent at 17:15:00", and I'd like to get a message from you like: "17:15:00 message received at 17:15:20; this reply being sent back at exactly 17:16:00"
[GMT 09/13/05 17:14:20] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> So, do you know if you have access to a synchronized clock somewhere?

[GMT 09/13/05 18:50:55] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> science3-nrlp3, so this problem doesn't seem tied to either ldm or web download transmission

[GMT 09/13/05 18:53:06] <StacyBrodzik-Ops> science3-nrlp3, ok, the images should start going to the ldm queue again.  they are created at 02 and every 10 minutes thereafter.  let me know when you start getting them

[GMT 09/13/05 20:21:24] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Hi Jim.  I'm looking at some of the radar data coming from 42, and I'm seeing what looks like duplicated beams in the data stream.
[GMT 09/13/05 20:22:24] <carswell> I have my display running. I'm don't see it on my real time display, but let me take a look at the data. 
[GMT 09/13/05 20:22:33] <carswell> they are running in a sector scan mode.

[GMT 09/13/05 20:25:50] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> They were doing sector scanning yesterday as well, but I didn't notice the duplicated beams in the data.
[GMT 09/13/05 20:25:58] <carswell> I'm looking at the raw packets now on manati.
[GMT 09/13/05 20:29:30] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Scratch my previous comment.  It looks like there was a brief period around 19:35 yesterday with the same thing happening.
[GMT 09/13/05 20:30:55] <carswell> I'm seeing duplicate packets. I compared my receive files the other day to the cache files. I saw duplicates in their too. I will have them capture what's going off the plane so that I can determine where the duplication is occurring. 
[GMT 09/13/05 20:31:46] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> OK, thanks.  In the meantime, I think I'll try to put something on this side to ignore back-to-back duplicate beams.
[GMT 09/13/05 20:52:13] <carswell> ChrisBurghart-Boulder, problem should be fixed.
[GMT 09/13/05 20:52:34] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Wow, that was fast.  Thanks!
[GMT 09/13/05 20:53:21] <carswell> Having xchat is a nice tool for debugging problems quickly. Found an extra process running on the server.
[GMT 09/13/05 20:54:35] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Aha.  That would do it.  I'm suprised I didn't see more duplicates, though.  
[GMT 09/13/05 20:55:46] <carswell> We are running at almost 6kbaud. So the link actually clamps down on duplicates.
[GMT 09/13/05 20:56:24] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> So running at the ragged edge can help sometimes.. :-)
