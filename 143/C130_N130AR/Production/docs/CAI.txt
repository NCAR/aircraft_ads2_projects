The RAF Community Aerosol Inlet (CAI) is a three-stage diffuser designed
to slow the air prior to its ingestion into the cabin for distribution to
the various particle samplers.  Flow through the CAI is monitored at three
locations:  Intake Shroud (INQC1,INPS1), Sampling Plane (INQC2,INPS2,INTEMP)
and Exhaust Cone (INQC3,INPS3).  In each case the QC designation stands
for dynamic pressure, the PS for static pressure and the TEMP for total
temperature.  Airspeed calculations (INTAS1,INTAS2,INTAS3) are performed for
each location to provide a direct comparison of the flow characteristics of
the CAI.
     A total of seven (7) sampling tubes are used to distribute air
samples to the in-cabin analyzers.  To ensure uniform sampling, a constant
volumetric flow must be maintained within each sample tube.  Users taking
samples from the CAI are responsible for maintaining a predetermined flow
rate.  All unused tubes are routed into a common manifold from which RAF
pulls the flow (INFLOW,INFLOWC) needed to preserve the flow characteristics
at the sampling plane.
     The air flow through the CAI is fairly well-behaved with a
well-correlated deceleration from the free stream to the sampling plane.
This ratio will vary somewhat with altitude.  However, pitch and sideslip
maneuvers do not appear to affect this relationship.
